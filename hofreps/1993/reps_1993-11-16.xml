<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, under standing order 96 I raise a matter of privilege. It relates to the performance by you of your duties as the independent Speaker and therefore, in a sense, the head of this parliament. I base my matter of privilege on an article by one of Australia's best known and most respected political journalists, Mr Laurie Oakes. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 9 November 1993, and commencing where material, the article reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it was also about teaching Martin a lesson. The speaker had made the mistake of thinking he was independent. He had not sought the prime minister's agreement before bringing down the bipartisan committee's report on the televising of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A source in the Keating camp said: "He should have found out first what Paul would cop." Keating's attitude was that he was not going to be ambushed by the speaker. Beazley's job was basically to put Martin back in his box. When the matter was raised by journalists travelling with Keating on his recent overseas trip, he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Prime Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">responded, `I do not give a&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>expletive deleted&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">about the speaker!"</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not give a&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>expletive deleted&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">about the speaker!" Martin undoubtedly got the message and he would be extraordinarily brave or foolhardy if it did not affect the way he performs his role in future. This is one reason the reforms to the House of Representatives procedures recommended by a committee headed by Neal Blewett&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the honourable member for Bonython&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are unlikely to improve things much. They would do nothing to protect the speaker from government pressure. If the referee has to be concerned about his own position, the game is rigged.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, this is not a matter which was in the contemplation of the parliament when it passed the Parliamentary Privileges Act in 1987. I think section 6 of that act abolished what was colloquially known as the doctrine of constructive breach of privilege. That section states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Words or acts shall not be taken to be an offence against a House by reason only that those words or acts are defamatory or critical of the Parliament, a House, a committee or a member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to words spoken or acts done in the presence of a House or a committee.</PARA>
<PARA>The breach of privilege I assert has occurred on this occasion is that by the evidence of this report and, most specifically, the clearly contemptuous, derogatory and insulting reference to you&mdash;I repeat, the most derogatory, insulting, contemptuous reference; it could hardly be more contemptuous&mdash;made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the leader of the majority party in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pattern of conduct which is calculated to deny you your independence as the Speaker of this parliament. Your role and the trust that you hope your role invokes from both sides of the House rest upon an acceptance by both sides of the House that you are truly independent. The Prime Minister, by his conduct and remarks, and particularly by his clear insult&mdash;he portrays his sensitivity only by his baying interjections while I present the point of privilege; quite plainly, this is a pattern of conduct&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on 10 November 1993, of the Hon. Justin Hilary O'Byrne, AO, Senator for the State of Tasmania from 1946 to 1981, President of the Senate from 1974 to 1976, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>Justin O'Byrne was born on 1 June 1912 at Launceston, Tasmania and educated at St Patricks College. At the age of 18 he left home and ventured north to Queensland where he worked as a drover, fencer and even a bullock driver. In 1940 he enlisted in the RAAF, becoming a member of the first Australian fighter squadron. He flew patrols over the English Channel and the North Sea and took part in operations over France. It was on one of these operations over France in 1941 that his aircraft was shot down and he was captured by the occupying German forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justin ended up in the infamous Stalag Luft Three prison camp. The courage and tenacity of the men there were made known to the world after the war through movies such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Wooden Horse</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Great Escape</EMPHASIS>, the latter depicting the attempted escape of some 72 POWs. He spent three years and nine months as a prisoner of war&mdash;a very long time. He returned home in 1945 having attained the rank of flight lieutenant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justin was a great storyteller and would tell of the years spent plotting escapes from the prison and holding political discussions to alleviate the boredom. One of the aircraft that Justin flew during the war, a spitfire, has been on display in the Australian War Memorial since 1956, and a plaque on it bears his name and those of two of his comrades. This stands as just one of the permanent reminders of the participation of Australian pilots in the war and the contributions they made for their country in lands far from their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1946 Justin stood for, and won, a seat in the Senate representing his home state of Tasmania, the beginning of a political career which was to last through 34 years, nine Governors-General and eight Prime Ministers&mdash;not a bad record! At the time of his election he was the youngest senator in the place. He served on numerous committees including the Senate Standing Orders Committee, the Joint Committee of Public Works and the Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House, just to name a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justin also served as Temporary Chairman of Committees from 1949 to 1961. He spent 10 years as the opposition whip and then a short period as government whip before his election in 1974 to the office of President of the Senate&mdash;the official title that went with his unofficial title of `Father of the Senate'. Justin presided over the Senate during one of the most tumultuous and still controversial periods in Australian politics, and the fact that there was not one dissent from his rulings, nor any vote of no confidence, is testament to his performance and the high regard in which he was held by those on both sides of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A self-described `inveterate interjector', Justin said he often had to bite his tongue while sitting in the chair and, for those who knew him, this must have taken some degree of self-control. He managed to maintain the dignity of his position at all times. As a senator, he was vigorous in debate and his quick wit and humorous antics often brought relief to the sometimes dull proceedings in the Senate. It also got him suspended on one occasion. He was invariably good for a laugh, a joke or a good story. Throughout his career Justin advocated equality for all Australians and social justice for all Australians. In his maiden speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must never lose sight of the splendid vision of our destiny. Australia's destiny envisages the establishment, the complete establishment, of the rights of man, including equality of opportunity for all.</PARA>
<PARA>He did not lose sight of his vision for Australia and fought hard to make it a reality. He spent almost his entire life in the service of the Australian people. He was quite a remarkable man of courage, determination and goodwill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984 he was awarded an Order of Australia for his services to politics and government. Justin O'Byrne was an Australian of whom we can all be proud. He will be sadly missed, particularly in the state of Tasmania. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Anne, and the family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and to record the respect that we on this side of the House have for the service which the late Justin O'Byrne gave to this country and to this parliament. Justin O'Byrne was an intensely proud Australian with a strong sense of community spirit and a fierce commitment to the importance of parliament in the life of a democracy. His record of service is impressive, and is marked by an unswerving dedication to the ideals in which he believed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justin O'Byrne's achievements were the product of his own hard work, his sense of history and the high respect in which he was held by those with whom he worked. As the Prime Minister has said, Justin O'Byrne gave notice at an early age that he lacked nothing in initiative and adventure, setting off as an 18-year-old during the Depression to go droving, bullock driving and fencing in Queensland. As we also heard, on the outbreak of the Second World War he enlisted in the RAAF and became a fighter pilot as an original member of 452 Squadron. He was shot down in 1941 and endured over 3 1/2 years as a prisoner of war, a lot of it apparently spent trying to tunnel out of infamous places such as Stalag Luft Three, before returning to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not long after his discharge from the services, Justin O'Byrne was elected as Labor senator to represent his home state of Tasmania. He went on to become the second longest continuous member of the Senate. He was father of the Senate when elected in 1974 as its President. I recall that that election was not without its controversy with reports that a defection from the opposition ranks gave Senator O'Byrne the numbers. Whatever the circumstances of his ascent to the most senior position in the Senate, Justin O'Byrne proved to be an outstanding occupant of that high office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He displayed a great respect for the institutional nature of the position to which he had been elected. In donning the mantle of the President, Senator O'Byrne did not in any sense abandon his strongly held beliefs nor his intense loyalty to his own side of politics. But in his conduct in that position of President he was able to transcend partisan politics and earn the respect of all members of that chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when politics and politicians are held in less than fulsome regard by the Australian community, Justin O'Byrne's conduct as Presiding Officer of the Senate is a fine example of the best traditions of our democratic system. I think it is significant that at no time during his occupancy of the presidency was there a motion of dissent from his rulings or a vote of want of confidence. This is even more noteworthy when one remembers the tumultuous times over which he presided, including the historic first joint sitting of the House and the Senate and, of course, the supply crisis, which culminated in the dismissal of the Whitlam government almost 18 years to the day of Justin O'Byrne's death last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the final remarks in the Senate of the man to whom we pay our respects today in a sense sum up the sort of person he was. In his valedictory speech of 12 June 1981 he spoke of how he would miss the comradeship of the Senate and made reference to the times of great trauma, great conflict and great humour. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have found this to be a grand place to get to know and to learn the value of each individual person who comprises the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Justin O'Byrne was indeed a grand member of the place he loved and the place he served so well. I convey our sincere sympathy to his wife and children, who can be justly proud of their husband's and father's contribution to Australian public life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in supporting this condolence motion for the ex-President of the Senate Justin O'Byrne. I in one sense fear for former Senate presidents, as in just a couple of months we have had a condolence motion for Condor Laucke from South Australia and now for Justin O'Byrne from Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On reading about him again it reminds me of so many of his activities and his wide experiences over his lifetime. Justin O'Byrne seems to have been the quintessential Labor senator in the old mould from Tasmania. Justin O'Byrne was one of the few Labor men who had direct experience in primary industries, particularly the pastoral industry, as remarked by the Leader of the Opposition, in Queensland and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was, of course, personally touched by the Great Depression, and that is evident from his speeches in the Senate and his other writings. I choose to quote from his maiden speech to the Senate in 1947 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a primary-producing country, but it must be confessed that in the past our farmers have been obliged to eke out a very meagre existence. Although they have done so much for this country, they have had to endure all kinds of privations, and in the past many of them have been unable even to maintain in repair their dwellings and fences. In the depression of a few years ago great numbers of them were obliged to beg for financial assistance. Bearing those things in mind, this Government is determined to ensure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>effectively&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a just return for their labours.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of language we certainly should hear more of in this parliament as in fact farm incomes continue to be negative, as they have been for an indecently long period. As previous speakers have detailed, Justin O'Byrne also gave fine and distinguished service to the Royal Australian Air Force in World War II. I have a particular respect for those who not only served their country in wartime but also were prisoners of war, who suffered all the deprivations of and provided all the special courage required to survive a period as prisoner of war&mdash;in his case for 3 1/2 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know if Justin O'Byrne had been at the Australian War Memorial last Thursday he would have been delighted to have witnessed the entombment of the Unknown Soldier in that magnificent ceremony. I digress to commend the Australian War Memorial, the Prime Minister's eulogy and the conduct of the armed forces in relation to the entombment of that Unknown Soldier. I know that as a World War II veteran Justin O'Byrne would have known so many whose graves are not known as we speak this day and, therefore, no doubt he would have also delighted in the conduct of that entombment. After his war service he served for a period in postwar reconstruction before entering the Senate in 1947, and thus commenced his colourful career with its pinnacle as President of the Senate from July 1974 to February 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not dwell on the matter of his election which has already been covered. I will simply say that Michelle Grattan of yesteryear in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 10 July 1974&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of parliament from Tasmania, I take particular pride in standing in this House today to pay tribute to a legendary parliamentarian, Justin O'Byrne, senator for Tasmania from 1946 to 1981. With the passing of Justin O'Byrne, the Australian Labor Party has lost one of its links with its glorious past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarded as one of the old school of Labor people, Justin left Tasmania as an 18-year-old during the 1930s Depression to go droving, bullock driving and fencing in Queensland. It was here he first joined the Australian Workers Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A boyhood ambition was realised when he learnt to fly under the empire training scheme. As mentioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), Justin enlisted in the RAAF in 1940. After advance training in Canada, he joined the first Australian fighter squadron. One of the spitfires he flew is on display in the War Memorial in Canberra bearing his name and those of two other famous war aces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a pilot officer and flight lieutenant, Justin served overseas in Canada and the United Kingdom. He took part in the defence of London during the blitz and in patrols over the English Channel and the North Sea. During operations over occupied France, he was shot down in August 1941. After bailing out, he was captured by invading German forces. He was moved to several prison camps before being finally placed at Stalag Luft Three, the main prison camp for fighter pilots.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned previously, he was involved in the planning of two escapes in this prison whose inmates have become legendary figures: the great escape and the wooden horse escape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a prisoner of war in Germany for 3 1/2 years, Justin must have seen the types of politics and human behaviour which were poles apart from his way of thinking and that of Australians at that time. When Justin returned to Australia in 1945 and was discharged in 1946, his commitment to social justice principles could not have stemmed from a more realistic and sound background. Justin O'Byrne did not seek glory and recognition for the dedication he showed in serving his country. His struggle for human dignity and equality continued during his return to Australia. In 1946 he was elected to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be difficult to find another politician who had seen the same degree of change during his political career as did Justin O'Byrne. Justin O'Byrne saw eight Prime Ministers come to power: Chifley, Menzies, Holt, McEwen, Gorton, McMahon, Whitlam and Fraser. Justin, a senator from 1946 to 1981, was to many of us the bridge, the real link, between those years of the real true believers and those of us who were brought up with the tales of them by our parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justin was there participating in all of it during the Chifley and Evatt period, the split in the 1950s that saw the fragmentation of the party, the 1960s under Calwell, the regaining of power briefly in the 1970s, and the glimpse of the potential regaining of power under Hayden. He lived to see the current long reign of Labor during the 1980s and 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justin was a mentor to all of us in the Tasmanian branch of the Labor Party. He was always there to offer advice and guidance, always ready with the anecdotal evidence that brought us enthusiastic political amateurs back to sense and reality. As we are about to debate some of the most influential legislation ever brought before this parliament, it is timely to remember the words spoken by Justin in his maiden speech and also quoted by the Prime Minister. He said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add a few words in support of the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). Justin O'Byrne's death really brings to an end yet another part of that fascinating phase&mdash;the evolution of Australian politics. Those of us who are here today have no-one who was a prisoner of war amongst our number. Yet immediately after the war, as a percentage, it is incredible how many of those who were elected to this place, and to the Senate, were in fact prisoners of war. Justin O'Byrne was one of those. He certainly had a distinguished war record. He certainly showed, after his election, something of that breadth of understanding that no doubt the traumas of those years in a prisoner of war camp and in the services subjected him to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His principal contribution in the parliament, however, to my recollection, was as President of the Senate. I want to say two things about that. The first point is that as President he presided in the old Senate chamber, not in this building. Those of us who have been down and seen the old Senate will know of the relative intimacy of the place. While it is true that no-one in fact moved a motion of no confidence in Justin as the President of the Senate, the intimacy of the place meant that there was far greater opportunity for the understanding of individuals. One of my regrets in the move here is that we are too far apart, that the place is more of an auditorium, it is more formal and there is less of the intimacy that men like Justin O'Byrne experienced in the old building. I think that is a pity, for Justin O'Byrne's example is one that we need all look at and admire. He certainly was a man of the people. He spoke very much, not just as a senator for Tasmania but as President of the Senate, on behalf of all parliamentarians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of his presidency that I briefly want to refer to is that memorable joint sitting. It is the only occasion that there has actually been a joint sitting of the two Houses under the constitutional provision. It allows, after an election, the resolution of an impasse between the two Houses by a formula allowing members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives meeting at the one time. It was a remarkable occasion. It is the only occasion, really, when members in fact addressed the old House of Representatives from alongside Mr Speaker's chair instead of from their places. It was an occasion when, in spite of the political differences, Justin was still able to show something of the wisdom, wit and humour that certainly enabled that which could have been a remarkably divisive occasion to be both very formal and very proper. I refer to that only because I think it is significant that we understand the importance of the process of the parliament and Justin O'Byrne's role in maintaining it and upholding the dignity and status of the parliament as such. Perhaps from him, in that respect, we all might glean some advice and perhaps follow his example today. On behalf of Rosemary and me, I extend to his widow and to his children our deepest sympathy on his passing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and previous speakers in support of this motion of condolence to the family of the late Justin O'Byrne. My first association with Justin O'Byrne was in the difficulties one experiences in reaching this place, so it dates back some time. Justin was a man who, when he came to recognise the truth, was prepared to fight for that truth and nothing turned him away. Through my relationship with him in the old House&mdash;he was then a member of the Senate&mdash;I found Justin to be, as the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has just been saying, a member of a generation that is somewhat different from that of today, when there is a closer intimacy, a greater warmth, a closer relationship between members of each chamber and between the members of both chambers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although Justin recognised there were problems in having a Senate, he was a great believer in the institution of parliament itself, the way the parliament conducted itself and its role in the Australian way of life. He had a generosity and a warmth about him, and an impish sense of humour. Even in the fiercest arguments, when he turned on that sense of humour he very much diffused whatever the strength was of the argument one was putting to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justin also had an unrelenting integrity. He was a man who was committed to his country, to Australia. He was committed to Tasmania and, as the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick) said, the loss of Justin O'Byrne is not just a loss to Australia, it is a great loss to the people of Tasmania. He had a deep and unyielding commitment to the Labor movement and to people less fortunate than he and his family. He was always able to find the time and resources to look out for those less fortunate than we members of the Australian parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loss of Justin O'Byrne signals an end to an era in Australian history. Given his heroism and contributions during World War II and the deprivations that he and so many other Australians suffered, he saw the futility of war&mdash;and he often spoke to me about that. It was quite remarkable that somebody who had been through those experiences retained that integrity, balance, wit and an unyielding commitment to peace and everything that peace brings to the people of our country and to the people of the world. He loved Australia. He loved Tasmania. On behalf of my wife and my family, I extend to Anne and her family our deepest sympathy at this sad time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Justin O'Byrne addressed the first Australian Labor Party branch meeting that I ever attended. From that day on, Justin became a friend&mdash;somebody I worked with for many years throughout the party organisation. In my early days in the party, he was one of the leaders of the ALP. He was always entering debate on the rules and all those issues which raised the heat at Labor Party conferences in those days&mdash;he was always in the middle.

In his later days when he went away to war, he had time in a prisoner of war camp to contemplate the stupidity of war and the difficulties that the world was going through in those times. He was certainly concerned enough to come back and to throw himself into the Labor Party and to go on and win a seat in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his early days, Justin was the youngest member in the Senate, where he remained a member for 34 years. He had a great sense of humanity&mdash;he constantly argued for peace throughout his political life and at Tasmanian branch meetings of the ALP. He was the opposition whip in the senate for 10 years. In those days Bob Poke, another Tasmanian, was his deputy, Gil Duthie was the opposition whip here in the House of Representatives and Lance Barnard was the deputy leader. In those days, Tasmanians had a fair hold over the executive of the opposition!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justin learnt the hard way. He did not have much formal education. He used to have a great saying: he learnt on the road and so he could be called a `roads scholar'. That was another part of his great sense of humour. Justin served his country well.

A fair and workable response to the High Court's Mabo decision requires a national approach, and that has always been the Commonwealth's aim. But, in any case, the Western Australian bill does not stand up either intellectually or morally. Firstly, its centrepiece is the wholesale and compulsory extinguishment of native title.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is vastly different from the extinguishment of native title in some particular case&mdash;for instance, where a past freehold grant is being validated, or a piece of land is being compulsorily acquired for some public purpose. The extinguishment here sweeps native title away across the board. It is also vastly different from Aboriginal people making a choice in a particular case to take statutory title instead. There is no choice here. This is not the extinguishment of a particular parcel of land, or the swapping of a title; this is the wholesale mass extinguishment of a private property right&mdash;the mass extinguishment of native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is no use saying that all of this is acceptable because Aboriginal people will get equivalent statutory rights. They are not equivalent to native title. If they were, Mr Court would not need to make the swap. If they were equivalent, what is Mr Court worried about? He knows they are lesser rights. So-called traditional usage rights do not, and never can, amount to a proprietary title. In the one Mabo case so far, the High Court gave the Miriam people possession as against the whole world. The opposition wants to completely  wipe out the native title, the proprietary title, the possessory title&mdash;which native title is and can become.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traditional use rights are conferred by a government; whereas native title is embodied in the common law established by the courts, and the inherent rights of Aboriginal people who satisfy the criteria. In other words, it is not a matter of wiping out the title and giving them back something which can be just as quickly taken away. They have an inherent right&mdash;not a conferred right&mdash;to something in the common law of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the protections that the holders of such traditional usage rights would have when the Western Australian government proposes to do something with the land are deliberately pitched at the lowest imaginable level. For instance, the bill allows freehold or leasehold to be issued over native title, making Mr Court's Aboriginal title capable of being taken away and given to a third party without compulsory acquisition procedures and protections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one in this house, and no person in this country, who owns a freehold title can have it taken by a government and given to somebody else. But that is what is proposed in the Western Australian legislation. It is not a process of acquisition, but a process that allows freehold or leasehold to be issued over native title, making Mr Court's Aboriginal title capable of being taken away and given to a third party when no non-Aboriginal title holder would be subject to such lack of protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When, for instance, a mining company wants to do something with the land, the procedures give the Western Australian minister a virtually unfettered discretion to disregard Aboriginal interests. All this is being done without a scrap of prior consultation with Aboriginal people. They have no right to be asked. There is no process of negotiation. Although Mr Court says that he has consulted lawyers from one end of the country to the other, that is not consulting Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the Commonwealth bill we are not going to stop Western Australia or any other state from attempting to validate its past grants on its own terms, but each state takes its own legal risk if it does not abide by our national standards, and it will not get help from us on compensation. We are not stopping Western Australia, or any other state, from introducing a bill to permit Aboriginal people to take a statutory title in place of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge Mr Court, if he thinks the rights are equivalent, to let the Aboriginal people choose. If he wants to set up a statutory title and say, `This is the same as native title', let Aboriginal people choose whether they want to switch from their native title to a statutory title. I challenge him to give them that choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He will not give them that choice because he knows what he has in mind is a much lesser right. He is actually tearing away from them a set of proprietary rights and putting in place thereof only a set of non-proprietary rights. We do insist that future dealings affecting native title comply with our national legislation, and our bill will override the Western Australian legislation to accomplish that. I repeat that our bill will override the Western Australian legislation to accomplish it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition spokesman on Mabo, the honourable member for Flinders, said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> last night that the High Court had recognised native title, that it exists as part of the common law and that Aboriginal people are entitled, like everyone else, to protection of their property rights. That was correct, but then he went on to give support for the core of Mr Court's approach which is to withdraw those rights&mdash;and it looks like the shadow cabinet has gone the same way. Mr Court would not have the gall to trample on any other Western Australian property rights in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party is always talking about the rule of law and rights to private property, except the private property of Aboriginal people. You would not be game to wipe out the private property rights of non-Aboriginal Australians in Western Australia. You are not even game to take away from Western Australian freeholders the right of veto over mining which exists with a lot of Western Australian freehold. You do not even have the courage to take that right away. But you want to extinguish the private property rights of Aboriginal people. You believe in private property, but you will have a mass extinguishment&mdash;the largest mass extinguishment of private property in Australia's history&mdash;at the hands of the government in a single act. You believe in the rule of law except when the High Court of Australia says it, and then it is a social experimentation place&mdash;`the High Court justice should resign'. Basically, this shows your form. You say you believe in private property and the rule of law, except you attack the High Court for bringing down a judgment similar to those brought down in other countries, and you extinguish private property rights on a wholesale basis in the state of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a national approach founded on our bill and supported by a consensus in the community can accomplish what Mr Court says he is after&mdash;that is, a bill that is non-discriminatory, which provides certainty for industry and the community and which will play a substantial role in national reconciliation. It is in the national interest that this national legislation be in place as soon as possible so that certainty can be established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After question time I will introduce the native title bill. But, more importantly, I hope that perhaps on this one occasion we can ask those opposite to put aside their politics on this. Just for once, when the country comes first, let them say to a race of people who have been pummelled around for 200 years that the whole of the political system is with them. That is the opportunity which the opposition has on this occasion. But the Court legislation will simply put their rights asunder and do in Western Australia as Mr Chaney and others on the Liberal side have said. They have said they are very disappointed with the legislation. Mr Viner has said that it is racially based, it discriminates against Aboriginals, because it takes away, it extinguishes, the legal rights that they presently have and so, on the face of it, is discriminatory, is racial.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The provision of consumer credit in Australia, including the question of credit card pricing, was hamstrung for too long by the credit acts enacted by state governments. Although they embarked on a review of their credit legislation, by the middle of last year&mdash;after they had been going for about six years&mdash;they had still failed to reach any sensible agreement about how these matters should be progressed. It was consumer affairs ministers at the state level, I think, who&mdash;in an increasingly deregulated financial market&mdash;believed they were somehow doing consumers a favour by maintaining a set of regulations which were preventing banks and some of the other financial institutions from getting out there and competing, and providing a better range of services for consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I realised that this process was going nowhere, I said to the state ministers that unless they could come to a speedy agreement about how these matters could be reformed, the Commonwealth would enact its own legislation to remove some of the restrictions which prevented the competitive market developing in relation to the provision of credit through credit cards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that it was partially as a result of the drawing up of our legislation&mdash;and our preparedness to proceed with it&mdash;that, finally, the states came to an agreement to remove some of those restrictions imposed by their current legislation and, at the same time, agreed that the whole of their credit legislation should be not only reformed but also made uniform throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, we have seen a quite astonishing development by the major banks, as far as the provision of credit is concerned. As recently as today, all of the four major banks have announced what they intend to do as a result of the removal of that restriction which prevented the banks charging fees for credit cards. So the four major banks, plus a whole raft of the regional banks, are offering an array of services which give consumers a real choice in what credit services they can obtain. The fees which some people thought would be very high have been announced at very modest levels, largely between $18 and $24 a year. That is less than 50c a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In return, we have seen a reduction in credit card interest rates generally of around four percentage points, down to about 14 1/2 per cent. I remind the House that it was only two and a bit years ago that some credit card interest rates were as high as 24 per cent. As a result of some of the increased competition, we are seeing interest rates for credit card services as low as 12 per cent and, in some cases, even below 12 per cent. What the banks have done in response to this greater freedom is, in some cases, to introduce fees. In other cases the services are retained without fees. In some cases an interest free period has been retained and in others interest has been imposed from the first day credit is used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in all cases interest rates have come down and, as a result, I think we will now see very considerable competition as consumers decide what kind of card, what kind of credit service, best meets their particular circumstances. Overall, it means that credit provided to the users of credit cards will basically be cheaper and they will be able to make their own arrangements in a way which best suits them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have very much appreciated the work that my colleague the Minister for Consumer Affairs has done in relation to SCOCAM and in bringing the states along to the point which they have now reached. We have also agreed that the Prices Surveillance Authority should continue to monitor this area of the financial marketplace to ensure that the current encouraging signs are continued and adhered to by the banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this change, we do have a lower rate for credit&mdash;credit which is availed of by very many people in the community&mdash;and an array of services which is the inevitable outflow of deregulation as the various banks begin to compete amongst each other and provide an array of services and, therefore, allow consumers to make the sort of choice which best suits their interests.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for  Finance and concerns the government's announcement in this year's budget that it intended to proceed with the sale of the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline in 1993-94. Can the minister advise the House of sale progress to date and what economic benefits will flow from this sale?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2870" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to advise the honourable member for Port Adelaide and the House that substantial progress has been made in the sale of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, which was an important asset sale listed in the list of assets to be sold in this year's budget. That sale involves 51 per cent being sold in a trade sale to the Australian Gas Light Co., AGL, and 49 per cent being sold through a competitive tender process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AGL's involvement comes from the fact that progressing the sale necessarily involves negotiation with that company because of the very substantial rights that AGL has under the existing gas haulage agreement which goes out to the year 2016. So it is a very longstanding gas haulage agreement. The rights that AGL has under that agreement include: absolute priority to the existing and future capacity of the pipeline, which means that it can make it very difficult for competitors to come on to that pipeline; rights to gas haulage at rates well below commercial prices; a first right of refusal to acquire the pipeline; and an absolute right of veto over any sale. Given those very substantial rights that AGL has under the existing gas haulage arrangements, it is necessary if one wants to make a sale to have substantial negotiations with that company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of the sale that has been negotiated to this stage is that AGL will relinquish its existing contractual rights; that gas haulage prices will not be increased&mdash;in fact, they will fall notably for larger users; that the gross proceeds of the sale are expected to be between $510 million and $550 million, from which AGL will receive $30 million as compensation for its relinquishment of its contractual rights; and also that, out of that gross amount of up to $550 million, the government will face some increase in public debt interest through acquiring the debt of the Pipeline Authority. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conditions of the sale to AGL are that the Trade Practices Commission approves the sale, which will necessarily involve its securing an appropriate set of arrangements to address concerns about any uncompetitive elements. The authorisation of the Gas Council of New South Wales will also be required for the new haulage agreement. The veto rights of the Cooper Basin gas producers will need to be resolved, and sale of the remaining 49 per cent will have to be at a price which is satisfactory to the Commonwealth. Those are the key conditions. If we can meet all those, we can get the sale through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competition issues that this sale throws up are of course important and we would be very concerned not to develop uncompetitive arrangements. In fact, we believe that the arrangements which will be part of this sale process will provide a much more competitive arrangement than currently exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the new gas haulage agreement will have to be approved by the Trade Practices Commission. It will define the limits to AGL's capacity reservation rights in the pipeline and so it will allow scope for use by third parties. This sale arrangement will also comply with the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill, which is now before the Senate, which defines a new pro-competitive regulatory framework for gas pipeline operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the opposition particularly to the fact that there are two key differences between this sale process and that which was attempted in 1990. Firstly, there is no increase in gas haulage prices. They will be reduced overall and quite substantially for large users. No-one will face higher prices. Secondly, there will be no attempt in legislation to override AGL's contractual rights which, as I have said, are being addressed through the sale negotiation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope on this basis&mdash;perhaps it is too much to hope&mdash;that by these two key differences we have addressed those major elements which caused the opposition to vote against this process and not support the sale process in 1990. I hope that this time we might get its support. I hope that that is not too much to expect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week's data showed employment rising strongly for the second successive month and job advertisements rising again. The Australian economy created over 32,000 new jobs in October, following a rise of 45,100 in September. The ANZ job advertisement series rose by a strong 7.7 per cent in October, following solid increases in previous months. It is now 27 per cent above its level a year ago. At the same time, the Australian Manufacturing Council and the MTIA survey for the September quarter showed a solid turnaround in manufacturing employment.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen data showing that household finance approvals for August were the second highest ever. Building approvals for September showed private sector approvals up four months in a row, to the highest level for four years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade figures for September showed a strong rise in exports, while imports growth slowed to return the trade balance to a merchandise trade surplus. Yesterday, we saw state by state figures for the Australian Chamber of Manufactures showing, for the first time, stronger expected growth in employment. I might add, this comes at a time when interest rates are at historically low levels; our inflation rate is at 2.2 per cent&mdash;well below the OECD average; we are continuing to increase our international competitiveness; and company balance sheets and profitability are continuing to strengthen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that, as well as all of these economic changes and economic conditions, from this week onwards 7,800,000 Australian taxpayers will begin to receive tax cuts or rebates or both, reducing tax paid to the Commonwealth by $3.4 billion. The tax cuts promised by the government in the election campaign have been delivered, they will be paid from this week and they will add to the impetus of growth in the economy which we are now seeing through better employment, better job advertising rates and in the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the MTIA surveys for the September quarter, which show a solid turnaround in manufacturing employment. All of these things come at a time when the Leader of the Opposition, not so many months ago, was saying that Australia was ready for a double-dip recession. I quote:</PARA>

<PARA>Today is a milestone. A response to another milestone: the High Court's decision in the Mabo case. The High Court has determined that Australian law should not, as Justice Brennan said, be `frozen in an era of racial discrimination'. Its decision in the Mabo case ended the pernicious legal deceit of terra nullius for all of Australia&mdash;and for all time. The court described the situation faced by Aboriginal people after European settlement. The court saw a `conflagration of oppression and conflict which was, over the following century, to spread across the continent to dispossess, degrade and devastate the Aboriginal people'. They faced `deprivation of the religious, cultural and economic sustenance which the land provides' and were left as `intruders in their own homes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To deny these basic facts would be to deny history&mdash;and no self-respecting democracy can deny its history. To deny these facts would be to deny part of ourselves as Australians. This is not guilt: it is recognising the truth. The truth about the past and, equally, the truth about our contemporary reality. It is not a symptom of guilt to look reality in the eye&mdash;it is a symptom of guilt to look away, to deny what is there. But what is worse than guilt, surely, is irresponsibility. To see what is there and not act upon it&mdash;that is a symptom of weakness. That is failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, some seem to see the High Court as having just handed Australia a problem. The fact is that the High Court has handed this nation an opportunity. When I spoke last December in Redfern at the Australian launch of the International Year for the World's Indigenous People, I said we could make the Mabo decision an historic turning point:  the basis of a new relationship between indigenous and other Australians. For the 17 months since the High Court handed down its decision, the government has worked to meet this challenge. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Consultations and Objectives</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Prime Minister, I have made our response to the Mabo decision a personal priority. The Mabo committee of ministers has worked tirelessly. A team of officials has provided continuous support. Right from the start, the government recognised the national and historic importance of a proper response to the Mabo decision, and put in place a year-long process of consultation and detailed policy development. Also right from the start, we made our twin goals clear: to do justice to the Mabo decision in protecting native title and to ensure workable, certain, land management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We held extensive talks with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, state and territory governments and the mining and pastoral industries. Our processes were open. We kept on talking&mdash;always on the basis of accepting the Mabo decision and wanting to make it work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One year after the decision, as part of our community consultations, we released a public discussion paper setting out the complex legal and other issues frankly and clearly, as well as examining possible ways to respond to them. Continuing this deliberate and open approach, on 2 September we released a detailed draft outline of possible Commonwealth native title legislation as a focus for public comment and for discussions with Aboriginal and industry representatives and with the states and territories. These were positive, detailed talks. They raised many important matters which have been taken up in the legislation I am presenting here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not say it was easy. Good policy rarely is. And the result will not&mdash;and could never&mdash;satisfy everyone. If it is to be good legislation it should not even try. This legislation is principled and workable, the product of a sustained and thorough policy process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, this has been a huge undertaking on a subject of immense complexity. The rewards for the nation of getting it right are also immense. To retreat from this challenge, to say that this opportunity is beyond our reach as a nation, beyond the limits of our collective intellect and goodwill, would be to betray not just the indigenous people of Australia but ourselves, our traditions and our future. It is to be hoped, Mr Speaker, that those who have so far confined their role in Mabo to spoiling and oversimplification will now bring a constructive approach to their examination of this proposal. The process has already seen much goodwill in the community, not least from people and groups whose interests and points of view are very different. Let us carry that goodwill into this parliament.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation complies with Australia's international obligations, in particular under</PARA>
<PARA>the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. As indicated in the preamble, the legislation constitutes a special measure under the Racial Discrimination Act for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people&mdash;providing as it does significant benefits such as special processes for determining native title; protection of native title rights; just terms compensation for any extinguishment of native title; a special right of negotiation on grants affecting native title land; designation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to assist claimants; and establishment of a national land fund.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></PARA>
<PARA>State and Territory Governments</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, the bill recognises that the bulk of dealings in land is done by the states and territories. The bill does not seek to change this situation&mdash;on the contrary it is properly sensitive to the prerogatives of the states. The Commonwealth is, however, playing its proper role in setting national standards and establishing a national framework for dealing with native title. The bill will enable state and territory governments to validate their past grants with certainty provided they adhere to the standards set out in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill specifically provides for states and territories to propose their own tribunals and arrangements for, firstly, determining native title claims and, secondly, deciding whether proposed grants affecting native title may be made. Provision is made for Commonwealth recognition of these state arrangements, and the criteria for this are set out clearly in the bill. Determination of native title claims may be in the Federal Court or a recognised state or territory body. Appeals must, however, be in the same stream in which the case was initiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to decisions on land use, where we have recognised state and territory processes the Commonwealth will step back. State bodies, not the Commonwealth tribunal, will decide whether grants should proceed. Such states and territories will also be able to override tribunal decisions in the state interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">States and territories that wish to see a national system with proper recognition of their land management responsibilities, and with fairness for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, will find it in this bill. We will be happy to cooperate with them. But we cannot accept Western Australian style legislation involving:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">compulsory, wholesale extinguishment of native title&mdash;a title embodied in the common law, and the inherent right of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who meet the criteria;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the mandatory replacement of this by a statutory title&mdash;a title only conferred at the pleasure of government, and which can be extinguished in particular cases virtually at a minister's whim;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a land management regime which provides only the flimsiest protections for Aboriginal people&mdash;protections far less than other land-holders enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a government wishes to introduce a bill permitting the voluntary conversion of native title to a statutory title it may do so under clause 20 of our bill. But let Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people choose for themselves whether they want the native title affirmed by the High Court or some statutory alternative. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Commonwealth's Approach to Native Title</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, native title is derived from the traditional laws and customs of indigenous people. These may vary considerably across Australia. This bill does not codify native title rights. Rather it provides that, in determining native title claims, the federal or state bodies involved will ascertain the rights in each particular case. Because the foundation of our position is acceptance of the High Court's decision, the bill protects native title to the maximum extent practicable. Under the bill, native title, once determined, will be held by a body corporate representing the native title holders concerned. This will facilitate dealings in relation to the land and will endure over time. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Validation and Security for Existing Grants</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, it is essential to safeguard the rights of those who hold existing grants of interests in land. This bill sets out a regime for the states to validate grants with certainty. It does not prevent states and territories from attempting to validate on their own terms. But they would do so at their own legal risk. And the Commonwealth would obviously not, in that case, help meet any resulting costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Validation covers not only past invalid grants&mdash;made before 31 December 1993&mdash;but renewals and extensions as defined in the bill. It also covers invalid actions of government. And it covers laws made before 30 June 1993. Validation by the Commonwealth, or in line with the Commonwealth regime, limits the extinguishment of native title. Only validated freehold grants, residential, commercial and pastoral or agricultural leases, and validated Crown actions basically involving permanent public works, will extinguish native title. Naturally, existing reservations for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention also to the recording in the preamble of the bill of the government's view that under the common law past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title. There is therefore no obstacle or hindrance to renewal of pastoral leases in the future, whether validated or already valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Validation of mining leases will not extinguish native  title rights, which can again be exercised in full after the grant, and any legitimate renewals, have expired. This is not discrimination against the mining industry, or some radical departure from existing practice. Let me quote, for example, section 113 of the Western Australian Mining Act. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a mining tenement expires or is surrendered or forfeited, the owner of the land to which the mining tenement related may take possession of the land forthwith . . . </PARA>
<PARA>How can we offer native titleholders any less?</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Future Regime</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as clearing up the uncertainties of the past, this bill provides for the future&mdash;it delivers justice and certainty for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, industry, and the whole community. It provides for the determination of native title and for dealings over native title land. Generally, governments may make grants over native title land only if those grants could be made over freehold title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This test is founded directly on a principle of non-discrimination. A government may not make a freehold or leasehold grant to somebody else over your or my freehold. If our title is to be extinguished, a government must acquire it and only for the purposes set down in compulsory acquisition legislation, and you or I must be given the protections involved. By contrast, a mining grant can generally be made over your or my freehold. It will be exactly the same for native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a clear, fair test which land managers in all jurisdictions can use. It does not mean that native title will amount to the equivalent of freehold in all cases. Where native title has been established, or where there is a registered claimant in the federal or state systems, the bill provides a process of negotiation and, if necessary, determination by the tribunal on whether a proposed grant should proceed. The relevant minister will be able to override tribunal decisions in the state or national interest. This emphasis on Aboriginal people having a right to be asked about actions affecting their land accords with their deeply felt attachment to land. But it is also squarely in line with any principle of fair play. It is not a veto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time frames set for notification, negotiation and arbitration are tight but fair. Provision is made for  expedited processes where a particular grant would not involve major disturbance to land or interference with the life of Aboriginal communities. Moreover, classes of grant can be excluded from the negotiation process altogether where they would have minimal effect on any native title. Certain prospecting and exploration permits would be likely to fall within this category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where native title has not yet been determined, governments will be able to ascertain whether there is a credible native title interest in land over which they wish to make a grant. Also, for example, a mining company operating on what has been assumed to be vacant crown land will be able to seek a determination whether native title exists. Normal compulsory acquisition procedures, including a right to compensation, will apply to native title land. This means that governments can acquire land from native titleholders, just as they can from other land-holders, for public purposes such as infrastructure development. The integrity of the land management system will thus be maintained. But we insist this be achieved in a way which respects the profound Aboriginal connection to the land and provides appropriate protections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill explicitly recognises that native titleholders may choose to surrender inalienable native title on terms acceptable to them, for example to exchange it for a statutory title. For example, native titleholders may wish to lease their land for a tourism or other commercial venture. The bill recognises further that there may be cases where regional negotiation is the most efficient way to avoid or resolve conflicts over land use for large areas. Where we judge this to be a promising approach, the Commonwealth is prepared to facilitate such negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Access to Tribunal and Court Processes</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the bill concerns detailed arrangements to establish a national native title tribunal and to develop a capacity in the Federal Court to determine native title and compensation claims. The tribunal will conciliate and determine proposed uses of native title land where there are no recognised state or territory bodies. The bill sets out criteria for Commonwealth recognition of state bodies. However, beyond this, the government takes the view that a right cannot be said fully to exist unless people are empowered to pursue it. This is especially true for Aboriginal people, who are, as a group, the  most disadvantaged Australians. Claimants for native title will need assistance to pursue their claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will therefore, under the bill, determine representative Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to assist claimants. They will not have a monopoly on representing native title claimants: individual claimants or groups of claimants can go elsewhere if they wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representative organisations will also assist in coordinating claims: it is important that claims come forward in a sensible, organised way. They will also be a channel for notification of proposed actions affecting native title as provided for in the bill. The organisations will, of course, be fully accountable for any funds provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where third parties are engaged in litigation involving native title, the Attorney-General will have a capacity to provide funding for legal assistance, should he consider it appropriate. The government will be consulting key stakeholders&mdash;such as Aboriginal representatives and the NFF in establishing the guidelines that the Attorney-General will rely on in taking decisions. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Industry Interests</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry gains a very great deal from this bill because it imposes clear, statutory rules for land use where the Mabo decision left uncertainty. The bill does not lock land away. On the contrary, as I have explained, we are not setting up complicated barriers to mining exploration or operations. Where state processes, for example mining warden's courts, are suitably supplemented to take sensitive account of native title interests and are recognised by the Commonwealth, they&mdash;not the Commonwealth tribunal&mdash;will make decisions on mining applications. In our negotiations with the states some constructive proposals have already been made in this regard, which are acceptable in principle to the government. Moreover, there is specific provision for matters decided at the exploration stage not to be re-opened when mining is being considered. Protections in state and territory laws against over-bidding by another company remain and existing mining operations will not face additional conditions or costs, for example for land rehabilitation, because of native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will ensure the validity of legislative regimes governing economic activities offshore&mdash;those relating to commercial fisheries and petroleum extraction operations being of particular note. However, recognising the different circumstances applying offshore, while any future grants or interests will have to be issued in a non-discriminatory manner, they will not be subject to the freehold test or to the associated negotiation and arbitration procedures. In general, the bill provides that governments can confirm any existing ownership of natural resources, including forests and minerals. But any future acquisition of natural resources from native titleholders must&mdash;properly&mdash;be on a non-discriminatory basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that Aboriginal people who own or acquire a pastoral lease, and who also would satisfy native title criteria but for the prior extinguishment of their rights, may choose to claim native title. This is no back door: to get native title, the same criterion of continuing connection with the land will need to be satisfied and the bill provides that the pastoral lease may be maintained, so that the land need not be lost to pastoral use. The government remains totally committed to a strong, viable pastoral industry and to Aboriginal people's participation in it. This bill therefore offers clear provisions for dealings in native title land and certainty to our great resource-based industries. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Application of Laws to Native Title</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that laws and regulations applying generally in the community also apply to native title land provided they are consistent with this bill. This covers such matters as heritage protection, environmental and health controls and fishery regulation. Native title land is thus kept fully within the reach of Australian law. The bill allows existing access to beaches, waterways and other recreation areas to be confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many specific laws affecting use and management of land are likely to need review to take account of native title. For example, the Commonwealth will, over the next two years, review our laws to better recognise native title hunting, fishing and gathering rights. We will be asking the states and territories to do the same. I note too that the bill does not affect rights under Commonwealth land rights legislation. We will be looking at a range of Commonwealth legislation, including Commonwealth land rights laws, in light of the native title regime. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Compensation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interests of fairness for existing grant holders, where compensation is owed to native titleholders for validation of past grants, it will be government, not the grant holder, who pays. We recognise that the Commonwealth should make a proper contribution towards compensation costs. We will have further discussions with the states and territories willing to join with us in this national approach, as well as on cost sharing for the legal and administrative regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just terms will be payable for extinguishment of native title. We take the view that any special attachment to the land will be taken into account in determining just terms. Compensation for impairment, for instance for surface disturbance caused by mining, will be on the basis of existing State and Territory regimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the bill makes provision that compensation may be non-monetary, for example, the granting to native titleholders of alternative land. It permits such issues to be raised in compensation negotiations, including where existing grants have been validated. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Land Acquisition</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has always recognised that despite its  historic significance, the Mabo decision gives little more than a sense of justice to those Aboriginal communities whose native title has been extinguished or lost without consultation, negotiation or compensation. Their dispossession has been total, their loss has been complete. The government shares the view of ATSIC, Aboriginal organisations and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, that justice, equality and fairness demand that the social and economic needs of these communities must be addressed as an essential step towards reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While these communities remain dispossessed of land, their economic marginalisation and their sense of injury continues. As a first step, we are establishing a land fund. It will enable indigenous people to acquire land and to manage and maintain it in a sustainable way in order to provide economic, social and cultural benefits for future generations. Addressing dispossession is essential but will not be enough to overcome the legacy of the past and achieve reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a further stage, we will, in consultation and negotiation with ATSIC and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, look at ways to increase the participation of Aboriginal people in Australian economic life and to safeguard and develop Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. We will invite ATSIC and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, to develop proposals and to provide formal advice following the important National Reconciliation Convention to be held in October 1994. What I will be looking for is constructive, realistic proposals, which will develop a positive community consensus and contribute to a lasting reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Implementation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will establish a task force of officials within my department to oversee the practical implementation of this legislation. We are also providing the necessary funding this financial year for the task force to carry out its work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one should doubt our willingness to commit the effort and resources to make the scheme work, and work efficiently. If the bill is approved by parliament, by 1 January 1994 most major aspects of the future regime will come into force. Aspects which depend on the establishment of new institutions will come into effect as soon as possible on a date to be prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land management challenges posed by Mabo are hugely important and they are comprehensively dealt with in the bill. But let me conclude, as I started, on the wider significance of the Mabo case. For today, as a nation, we take a major step towards a new and better relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. We give the indigenous people of Australia, at last, the standing they are owed as the original occupants of this continent, the standing they are owed as seminal contributors to our national life and culture: as workers, soldiers, explorers, artists, sportsmen and women&mdash;as a defining element in the character of this nation&mdash;and the standing they are owed as victims of grave injustices, as people who have survived the loss of their land and the shattering of their culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who can say that we would have survived these experiences as well as they have? Today we offer a modicum of justice to indigenous Australians because we have reached an understanding of their experience&mdash;and our responsibility. Today we move that much closer to a united Australia which respects this land of ours, values the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage and provides justice and equality for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already, in the process of developing the bill, we have learned a great deal about each other and how to work together. We have extended the frontier of our mutual understanding. Perhaps the most outstanding, but by no means the only, example of this has been the participation of representatives of the combined Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Organisation Working Party in the unprecedented negotiations leading to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In hailing what she termed `a remarkable settlement and historic agreement', Lois O'Donoghue, the Chairperson of ATSIC, said, and I quote, `indigenous affairs will never be the same again in our nation'. It is for that reason, above all, that I  commend this bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's incompetent economic management which has caused the highest number of unemployed Australians ever recorded by the ABS.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason for this is simple: last month's figures for unemployment from the Australian Bureau of Statistics stated that 982,000 Australians were out of a job; and nearly one in four had been out of a job for more than a year. Of those, over half had been out of a job for two years. This figure is a record for the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have is a fundamental mismatch between rhetoric and fact. We saw in the budget the government's rhetoric on unemployment. The primary objective of this budget is jobs and a promise to create 500,000 more jobs over the next three years. What is the fact? There are 982,000 Australians on the unemployment scrap heap, 11.2 per cent of the work force&mdash;just one-tenth of a per cent off the record of 11.3 per cent. That is simply a string of empty, broken and unfulfilled promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time I was able to raise this matter in the House was 17 August&mdash;three months ago. The government has not only guillotined debate in this House but also denied the opposition any ability to place it under scrutiny. Today we are going to do just that on behalf of those Australians and Australian families who are out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three months ago, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) told this House that the government's response was to go right to the heart of the problems that will emerge in the area of unemployment. Sadly, that is just more rhetoric. It has not gone to the heart of the problem at all. The bankruptcy of this government's response was shown by one of its senior bureaucrats, Ted Evans, who a couple of weeks ago in an address to the economic policy conference on reducing unemployment, let the cat out of the bag. His words were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me as an economist rather than a policy adviser repeat without qualifications; 11 per cent unemployment is a matter of choice.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, that is it. Ted Evans has shown that as a country we have decided that a significant percentage of our population will live in poverty. We hear a lot about innovative ways of reducing unemployment, but Ted Evans knocked that one on the head when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are looking for innovative solutions for reducing unemployment that is partly because, over the last two decades, we have found innovative ways of creating unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>For two-thirds of the last 20 years Labor has been in power, and continuously for the last 10 years. The sum total of the government's response in this parliament has been the submission from the caucus committee on employment matters to the government's white paper process. This committee is interesting in itself. It was set up to report to a green paper in December. We will get a white paper in March and a response in the budget. That will probably be August. So it will be 16 or 17 months after an election before we get any action at all on unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see the alternative, when the government really wants to get some action, in the advisory committee on the republic&mdash;something that goes to the heart of how we are governed in this country&mdash;which reported in three months. This committee is languishing around, flipping around looking for new ideas, and it will be 15 to 16 months before anything at all is done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The caucus response was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Growth plus</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a catchy name. When we debated it last time the minister indignantly suggested that rather than criticise the government we should be working with it to try to solve unemployment. The caucus document shows why fundamentally the two sides of politics cannot work together. The document shows that the Labor Party has no comprehension at all of what is involved in growth and has no comprehension at all that it, as the government, is contributing to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members were to go out and talk with business, as I have been doing for the last couple of months, they would find that the single most frequent complaint from business is that government does not understand what is involved in employing people. Just a couple of weeks ago I was talking to a chief executive of a company that is a household name around Australia. I will not mention his name because people are worried about vindictiveness at the moment. His comment was that it would take just another small downturn in the economy for major job shedding to occur in Australia's large companies once again and a small downturn overseas could easily see a crisis in unemployment in Australia with a rise to somewhere between 13 and 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, in talking with business we find that the on-costs kill companies when employing new people. At the moment a quarter of Australians are working for more than 50 hours a week. I do concede that the paper went some way towards discussing on-costs but only in a superficial manner. At least the document was positive in recognising on-costs and in talking about the training guarantee levy. I agree with that: we would have abolished it. David Clark in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> got it right when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All those companies offering phoney, taxpayer-subsidised training courses and seminars should be feeling rather uneasy&mdash;as should hotel operators in Port Douglas, Noosa and Noumea.</PARA>
<PARA>But there were some negatives in that report. All the expensive proposals were simply not funded. We know from the comments of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) that what the government is considering is just another tax&mdash;this time a jobs tax. The Secretary to the Treasury had some good words on that. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such proposals typically rest upon the assumption that the levy or tax itself will have no effect upon those who pay it and hence no effect on growth and unemployment. That is the assumption that needs to be tested in examining such proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>The document also showed that the Labor caucus has no comprehension that industrial relations is a fundamental issue here. Soon we will see legislation debated in this place that will be the government's payback to the trade union movement for its support during the election. When I started looking into the area of unemployment, particularly at part-time work&mdash;because it is a major issue for women&mdash;all over the place, wherever government was involved, I found caps on part-time work, things to hold back part-time work. I asked why, but I never got satisfactory responses until I came across one honest public servant who put it simply: part-time workers do not join trade unions. So, in an attempt to shore up its base support, from which it gets its money, it forgets about where its votes come from&mdash;those people who are basically out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot even be honest with itself. Being honest with oneself is a fundamental start to admitting any sort of problem. Today in question time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was talking about the ANZ job advertisements and how they showed that growth was on the way up. A couple of weeks ago when these came out they were at 4.5 per cent for the month. The fact is that over the last 12 months, September to September, those job advertisements have grown by 22 per cent. Coming out of the last recession, from October 1983 to October 1984, they grew by 51.4 per cent. So job growth is at a feeble 44 per cent of that which it was last time. That is hardly anything to crow about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that unemployment is the fundamental issue in the public's mind. Today we saw the Newspoll showing that unemployment still is uppermost in voters' minds, with 79 per cent of people nominating it as a very important issue. It is the public's No. 1 priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have watched the Prime Minister get emotional about Mabo. I have watched him get emotional about the republic. We are asking for the same level of commitment and the same level of emotion for Australia's unemployed&mdash;not to leave them on a scrap heap and not to have a committee that takes 15 to 16 months to decide what the government should do. Governing is actually about making some decisions, not about setting up a committee to ask where we should be going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government portrays itself as a government of social justice. Let me tell honourable members how this crisis that we have disproportionately affects different groups of Australians. Today we heard a statement about Mabo which goes to the heart of social justice, in the Prime Minister's words, for Aboriginal Australians. Today 50 per cent of Aboriginal people are out of work. If we look at ethnic communities, we see that 39 per cent of Lebanese are out of work, that 26 per cent of Arabs are out of work and that 30 per cent of Vietnamese&mdash;a significant population in my electorate&mdash;are out of work. The average unemployment rate for people of non-English speaking backgrounds is 15 per cent. For someone 55 years of age, the realistic chance of getting a job is very small. Someone 40 years of age is likely to be out of work on average for 61 weeks. A third of all Australians unemployed are under 25 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really irritates me that in all of this there are still glaring examples of bungling bureaucracy. There is a organisation called Crossroads at Ascot Vale in Victoria. It is run by the Salvos. It provides training and counselling, and it runs four businesses. I visited this program, as did the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) and the deputy secretary to the department. Crossroads takes homeless youth from all its shelters and channels them into training. It probably takes around 10 per cent of all homeless youth in Melbourne. We say `probably' because we cannot get an exact figure on it. It has a budget of $1.8 million a year. Of that, it generates $1.2 million itself, the Salvos chip in $200,000 and $400,000 comes from governments. Yesterday, in a telephone call with Crossroads, I was informed that its funding may not be guaranteed. Six weeks before Christmas it may be shutting down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The really irritating and ridiculous thing about this is that the funding is based on post-training reports. We support that sort of efficiency assessment. In this case DEET sent out its normal questionnaire. Its normal practice is to get a response and then, depending on the response, decide whether it will continue funding. The trouble in this case was that it sent out a questionnaire to illiterate, homeless youth. When DEET got a low response rate it decided the program was not working. That sort of insensitivity really riles me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four weeks ago I wrote to the parliamentary secretary offering to deal privately with this, but four weeks later I have not had a response. The department's deputy secretary visited the program and said to his department, `You have to find some way of funding this'. It is still not secure in its funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is going to respond. I have heard him respond before, and I suppose we will have the usual response: `Things are awful under us but they would be worse under you'. We do not accept that. We do not accept that in a $1.3 billion training program there is not room to actually do things better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side make a significant commitment to training programs and will continue to have a significant commitment to training programs, but we do not accept that everything is working well at the moment. We do not accept that the CES is operating to its maximum efficiency, and I know the departmental secretary is saying just the same thing. The CES is an organisation that has expanded enormously rapidly, and if unemployment actually comes down it will have real difficulties rolling back down because it has taken public servants from all other areas and it has ratcheted up. We have not addressed that because we are afraid to face the issue of contracting out some of its work. When one goes around and visits some of the CESs, it is very hard to see how it could not be done in an efficient and effective manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talked about this last time, I heard the minister talk about how we would enslave young people with low wages. Interestingly, Jennie George has since proposed a similar thing. I have been criticised for suggesting that people should have a percentage of award wages after they have been unemployed for a long period. Interestingly, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is now proposing exactly the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a speech in August, the minister opposite, with the invaluable gift of hindsight, admitted that the government probably should have established and maintained a higher level of direct assistance to the long-term unemployed throughout the 1980s. Again, the fact is that we were proposing that as early as our economic action plan. People in the department who are honest will actually tell us it was that, after the 1990 election, which formed the basis of newstart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House are prepared to make a commitment, but we are not prepared to accept that just because we want to change something means that we are prepared to leave unemployed people with as little hope as they have at the moment. At a Collingwood post-budget lunch on 20 August, the Prime Minister stated, `I stressed that the issue with which government will be judged and should be judged is unemployment'. Well, the jury is out and I say to the Prime Minister that by this side of the House and the Australian public he is going to be judged guilty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to reply to one or two points made by the opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). He presented his case in a modulated way and I think he has sincere concerns and commitments in this area, so I do not want to belittle him in any way in this debate, but I am afraid he has a number of his points wrong. He also has some features of his policy wrong, which I think require a little argument in this place if we are going to get this whole issue properly elucidated in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the first point because he picked up a couple of issues concerned with the Salvation Army centre. Let me say, firstly, that that is a skillshare centre and the policy of the opposition on skillshare is that all public funding should be phased out for them. Let us get this absolutely clear. If he is going to approach skillshare not on the basis of his personal feelings about the young people who are in the centre, or his personal feelings about the commitment of the Salvation Army folk who are running that centre, but in fact as a genuine opposition spokesman committed to the policy objectives laid down in Fightback&mdash;from which, apart from the GST, his leader has said the opposition has not walked back&mdash;he should have been going in and saying, `Given your particular type of skillshare, there is a requirement that after a couple of years you become self-funding. What has happened to you vis-a-vis the government is what we would intend for every skillshare'. If he were coming in and presenting himself honestly as a spokesman for the opposition and not a decent human being in his presentation to the people who operate that skillshare, that is what he would have to say, unfortunately, because it is opposition policy that as part of its savings over time all public funding for skillshare should be phased out. In some circumstances we do that too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of types of funding bases for skillshare. Skillshare is an excellent organisation, set up by us. We have anticipated there are some types of broadly based skillshare centres which will require effectively permanent funding. In other areas basically we do a deal with an organisation which has already demonstrated, either through its own business operations or its donations from elsewhere, that it is capable of establishing itself as independent after a couple of years. We give it a little seed money to make sure it does the job even more effectively and then, after that time, that seed money cuts out and we are able to put it into some other enterprise skillshare. That happens in a minority of cases with skillshare. It happens to apply to the skillshare with which he is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we entered into an agreement in relation to the Crossroads skillshare, the agreement was based on the assumption that now a phase-out would occur. The group operating it has said that it does not want resources phased out, whatever the initial agreements may have been, and that what the government ought to be doing is in fact coming in for a continuation beyond that period that we would normally fund an enterprise skillshare. We have said we will look at that, but all skillshare funding is up for grabs and final determination in December of this year. It would be most unlikely that we would make an exception in informing a skillshare about what its funding level is&mdash;a skillshare that has had an agreement with us that its funding should be phased out by then, even if we choose to change our minds to give it a changed piece of advice&mdash;in advance of other skillshares that are anticipating a continuation of government resources that have come from the nature of the agreements that have been arrived at with them. So I admire the passion of the shadow minister but not his devotion to facts and not his willingness to be a spokesman for his party instead of a spokesman for himself. But I do appreciate that it would take a particular kind of courage which not many members of this chamber would have to be a spokesman for his party in circumstances like those which he confronted at Crossroads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pick up a couple of other points. He said to us that there is always room for improvement in the CES labour market programs. I agree. We have had massive expansion of labour market programs. We have had a massive new undertaking, a new task, imposed upon the CES. There are major changes taking place in the CES organisation. But, whatever its imperfections, I will make two points about the CES. Firstly, if we look at case management associated with labour exchanges and employment agencies operative in Europe, an area with which we like to compare ourselves, we will see that their client to officer ratio is between about 40 or 50 to 1. The CES has operated through the recession with a client to officer ratio of about 90 or 100 to 1. So it works about twice as hard as the average labour exchange operator elsewhere. That is my first point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I make is this: if one happens to be long-term unemployed&mdash;the shadow minister said a thing or two about the long-term unemployed&mdash;one's only friends in town are the CES and the labour market programs that are operated essentially by private providers, sometimes by government providers, through the CES. He said that the CES ought to be contracting out activities. The CES does. It contracts out virtually the entirety of our labour market programs. Eighty per cent of the long-term unemployed who found a job found it through the CES and the labour market programs. They are the only friends in town of the long-term unemployed. So, whatever the imperfections of the labour market programs, whatever improvements we could make in them&mdash;we increased them during this budget and they are the subject of study of the employment task force&mdash;it is not to say that they have not been pretty effective to this point. They have been, under extremely difficult circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went on to talk about whether or not those opposite had positions that would deal with unemployment. They do not. Their position on these labour market programs is again&mdash;I would not want to be advocating these policies in these circumstances&mdash;that they actually have to get $435 million worth of savings to implement their policies. They have not changed that position. They do not have something new. They do not have a task force that is working out what ought to be done about unemployment. They do not have a policy review process that deals with that. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has made it quite clear that Fightback is intact apart from the GST. Of course, that implies that the taxation arrangements associated with the GST are out, but all the other savings measures and the tax cuts measures are all in place as far as the opposition is concerned. Included in amongst that is not a judgment about what the long-term unemployed need. The long-term unemployed, far more than the people who are just out of work in the short term, definitely need labour market programs. Nothing else will get them back into the work force. They have to be put in a position where they are capable of being job ready if we are going to get any form of capacity on their part to participate in work. So the opposition's position is to go for a $435 million cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the shadow minister said that this government knows nothing about growth. It is nice advice from the opposition on the subject of growth. During the 1980s we enjoyed about double the average OECD rate of economic growth and, although not double, we have the highest rate of growth in the OECD operating now. For a government that in the mind of the opposition is obviously pig ignorant, this is not a bad achievement. Somehow, accidentally, for most of the entire time that we have been in office we have just managed to do better than any like society. One is tough, but one has feelings in this game. If those opposite are going to make those sorts of accusations, they should at least leave a vestige of factual basis underneath them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then opposition members tell us that we ought to be doing something about on-costs. Unfortunately for the opposition, the one promise that it had in relation to on-costs it has been forced to jettison from Fightback&mdash;that was its position on what ought to be done with payroll taxes. That is one of the elements of Fightback that the opposition has had to jettison. So it has that little problem on its plate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When opposition members talk about on-costs, they do not seem to comprehend our comparative basis in this country and that of those other countries with which we like to compare ourselves. On-costs in most societies support unemployment benefits, they support people in retirement and they support health schemes. All these sorts of things are generally involved in the on-costs associated with countries with which we like to compare ourselves. In our case, on-costs are about 20 per cent to 25 per cent of salary. That is hard for a lot of small business people, medium business people and even large business people to wear. We would not walk back from that. But if they found themselves in France they would be discussing 60 per cent. If they were in most parts of western Europe the amounts would be ranging between about 30 per cent and 50 per cent. We have the fourth lowest set of on-costs in the OECD countries, as well as the fourth lowest taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at the same time as those opposite are saying, `Somehow you ought to deal with those on-costs. We are not going to deal any more with the main proportion of them that we were saying we would deal with&mdash;that is out the window. You ought to just deal with that in some way or another', they are suggesting that company tax arrangements should be raised from 33 per cent to 42 per cent. Imagine what a nine per cent jump in company tax would do to unemployment. When Brian Toohey asked the Treasury spokesman for the opposition on Sunday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> program, `Will you put company taxes up to 42 per cent which is what you promised?', the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) did not rule it out. He said, `As far as company tax is concerned, we will have to have a look at what can be done'. So the opposition is still basically committed to that element&mdash;as indeed it must be because it funds other elements of its Fightback proposals. The opposition comes rocking into town to talk to us about on-costs when it has taken away from its platform the principal on-cost change that it was going to make. Then it suggests that it is going to increase company taxes on top of that. Whereof do you speak?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister then came into this chamber and talked about statements by Mr Evans. I will clear that canard immediately. When Mr Evans said `We accept voluntarily any particular level of unemployment', he was making a general philosophical point about the Western world. He said that our types of societies, with a protective regime to support people through social wages and through attempts to create effectively high wage economies, take on board voluntarily around 10 per cent or 11 per cent unemployment. It was not just this society, it was generally through the Western world&mdash;which is a fair enough point to make because that is about the level of unemployment right through the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said that in the Third World or in the tigers other decisions are taken, and there are low wage elements which permit, while a broader based poverty, if you like, a higher level of employment. That is an arguable point. With one or two exceptions, if we look at most of the region we can see that it not only has a problem of poverty amongst wage earners, but also has a problem of poverty amongst the unemployed&mdash;and there are far larger numbers of unemployed. I take it that he was really speaking off the cuff&mdash;off the top of his head&mdash;in that regard. But that was the general proposition he was making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that there is a relationship between salaries and unemployment. There is no question about that. Basically, through the accords over the last decade we have had to haul back the consequences of the Fraser-Howard wage rises. The whole of the 1980s probably experienced a level of unemployment one or two per cent higher than it might otherwise have been because of huge wage rises that took place as a result of a very silly campaign run by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and Malcolm Fraser who said, `Get out there and get a cornucopia of dough together'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, over the last decade real wages have fallen by about seven or eight per cent. We have been able to allow that real wage burden to drift away from employers in this country by providing, effectively, social wages. They have been accepted generally by the trade union movement&mdash;social wages and other forms of benefit in the taxation system, education system or whatever. We have recognised that need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not a sensible economist in this country who would argue that it would make a dime of difference to unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, to massively cut wages&mdash;unless we really massively cut wages, and even that would be problematical because we would still have skills formation problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do that we will guarantee the situation that they have in New Zealand, where whole numbers of wage earners have to go onto charity with no real discernible impact on unemployment levels. The ultimate impact of that on the exchequer is one of the reasons why New Zealand has a much higher percentage of its GDP in the public sector than we have in this country. That is one of the reasons why that actually happens to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a very sensible course of action. But it does demonstrate the true nature of the opposition. When it boils down to unemployment, it has this magic pudding. The magic pudding is the massive wage cut. Those opposite come in here and criticise us for a little increase in taxation here and there whose impact might be a few dollars a week on the average household, but what it wants to do is rock into that average household for 30 per cent of the householder's wages. That is what the opposition is on about in dealing with employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad the opposition is raising employment issues in this place because it has had plenty of opportunities to raise them with me in question time over the last few months. It has chosen not to do that, except on the odd occasion. Would unemployment not be at least one of its top priorities? Today the opposition again chose not to raise it, even though it had this MPI on the subject, which usually entitles us to one question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's position on this, while not in the case of the individual spokesman, is confected. But in the case of the individual spokesman, it is misleading because he puts himself as a human being, rather than his party policy, on the line whenever this matter is discussed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in supporting this MPI and the comments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge). There is no doubt in the wide world that this Labor government has failed dismally to accept the real truth about what is wrong in Australia and about its bad government. It has failed to accept responsibility for the outcome of this bad government&mdash;that is, the massive numbers of unemployed Australians, both young and old.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The backdrop to what I am about to say really reflects on the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), who I know is trying his best to put on a brave face in difficult circumstances. But in reality, we have had Labor governments, federally and in most of the States, for more than a decade and the outcomes that we are seeing now in our economy&mdash;the huge numbers of unemployed, the lost opportunities for people and the human suffering&mdash;are directly attributable to the honourable member for Swan and his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Swan in a mild, half-heated way&mdash;he really did not have his heart in it&mdash;tried to say that the coalition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have put forward weak arguments which are based on an economic approach to what is needed in Australia which, he says, is flawed. He said that we were being somehow hypocritical in respect of the Salvation Army's plea for help and certainty with that valuable Crossroads program in Melbourne, because of our policy of requiring the good, sound performance of skillshare when in government. All the coalition's statements are very supportive of skillshare. We have all worked closely with skillshare programs in Australia and will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, thank goodness, the honourable member for Swan backed off his attack on us. He finished up by saying&mdash;and I am sure that I took his words accurately&mdash;that under his government all skillshare funding is up for grabs. So he acknowledges the general principle that all government funded programs, including skillshare, have to be subject to review, and under his government they will be&mdash;just as they would have been under ours. That is not to say that it is true, as I fear he implied, that if the coalition were in government we would dismantle the funding for skillshare. It is quite the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting point about the contribution of the honourable member for Swan&mdash;and it is somewhat sad&mdash;is that he spoke proudly, I suppose, about the achievements of his officers in the CES. I am prepared to say&mdash;and I am sure that members of the coalition are too&mdash;that we acknowledge and thank them for their difficult work and the rigours that they have to work under. But what is sad to me is that the honourable member for Swan, in defending his government, is really acknowledging that under his government there has been a massive explosion of the public service and a massive transfer of scarce funds to fund desperate bandaid measures to try to provide some assistance to these poor victims of the Labor government's bad management. That, I think, is the irony and the sadness of the speech today of the honourable member for Swan. In defending his officers, as he should&mdash;and we in the coalition acknowledge that many CES officers do a marvellous job&mdash;I think he is failing to recognise that his government has caused the pressure and stress on those people and that it will be responsible for the continued stress and pressure on those people until the government acknowledges that it has its policies wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to briefly mention what the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said in his opening statement in budget mark 1. I think we have finished up with budget mark 4 1/2. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary objective of the budget is jobs . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I challenge the honourable member for Swan&mdash;and I am sure that all Australians would agree with my point&mdash;to argue with the fact that in the end the government's policies and budgets have amounted to almost nothing on jobs. The caucus task force is in the same vein&mdash;long on motherhood and very short on substance with no real, honest solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I felt very sorry for the honourable member for Swan when he mentioned all the growth that has occurred. He compared us to OECD countries. Increasingly, senior Labor ministers compare Australia to other countries to try to defend, cover up and obscure their own bad management of Australia. I think I speak for most Australians when I point out to this House that Australia is not a European country; Australia is not a country in the Americas; Australia is Australia. We have more opportunities and more resources than most countries. We are indeed a very fortunate country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the federal government and a number of Labor state governments have failed to seize the opportunity and have failed to lead and take advantage of those wonderful assets that we have. So I object, frankly, to Australia being relegated into a table of comparisons to OECD countries and being told that, therefore, we are not doing too badly at all; that, therefore, according to the honourable member for Swan, we are okay. I find very sad his defending the government's performance by referring to those other countries but not acknowledging all the opportunities and resources that we have and being prepared to accept some of the blame for not using those opportunities and those resources as the government should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The caucus task force solutions are enough to frighten anyone, because they propose further debt. Any growth that has occurred under a Labor government, particularly in Australia in the last decade, is attributable to more debt&mdash;spending more than we earn. The Labor caucus policy task force report at this stage indicates that that ought to happen. I can talk for small business. I have been in small business; I work with them; I see them everywhere and I admire them greatly because they are indeed the engine of Australia. I would like honourable members on the other side to pause for a moment or, better still, go and ask small businesses in their electorates what they think of the spectre of proposing more spending, more debt and a further levy on all producers in Australia&mdash;there are 800,000 small businesses&mdash;to pay more towards the unemployed. I want them to ask themselves that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask them also to go to the small businesses who are trying to provide jobs and keep the people that they employ in work and ask them what they think of the extra taxes that they have to pay as a result of the budget&mdash;the extra wholesale sales tax and the extra fuel taxes which impact very heavily particularly on regional Australia, on regional employment and regional producers. The tyranny of distance is wiping out more jobs every day under Labor. It was very sad to see that the honourable member for Swan was not able to see the loss of jobs. For him to defend his caucus and his task force by encouraging them to come up with a litany of supply-side adjustments and to ignore the demand side of the formula is frightening and very sad. What we need, in place of handwringing and bandaids, which we see constantly from Labor in its panic, is some vigorous and courageous thinking. We need to tackle Australia's problems and to introduce change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend to everyone a reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> editorial on Saturday, 23 October 1993.

It is a significant editorial. It takes Labor to task for its dismal performance when it talks about nearly 12 per cent of Australians being unemployed. Finally, I ask the honourable member for Swan and all of his colleagues, when they walk down the street and look at the young Australians as they come towards them in the shopping centres, what do they think of the fact that one in three are unemployed? What do they think of the fact that the kids that are studying and doing these training courses which we support by and large will probably not get a job when they are qualified? They will be told to go back and do another training course. What do they think of these small businesses that are desperately trying to stay in business&mdash;the ones that are crying out for good, solid, courageous government policies?

It is the last thing that this country needs at the moment. That is why the government has a policy of growth plus. It is achieving the highest rate of growth in the OECD through the macro-economic policies that it has put in place through the recent budget&mdash;policies which were opposed by the opposition in this House.

How does that give any incentive at all to business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent budget gave an additional $2 billion stimulus to the economy. What is the opposition's position on that? The shadow Treasurer comes into the House and says that he wants to cut government spending by between $10 billion and $20 billion to bring it down to Asian levels. The honourable member for Indi said that we are Australia and that is right. But we would not take Asian levels of taxation and spending because that would mean we would have to embrace Asian levels of poverty and Asian levels for a social safety net&mdash;precisely what Asian countries do not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the House we have a commitment to growth through encouragement to business, a commitment to growth through an active industry policy, a commitment to growth through a lower corporate rate of tax, and a commitment to the overall conditions to encourage private industry to grow. That is why we have put in place the deficit reduction strategy to bring the deficit down to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. That will bring about the conditions for sustainable rates of growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what did we get out of the opposition during the budget? It wanted to oppose the budget in the Senate, putting all of that at risk and bringing about the spectre of less business confidence because of the spectre of rising interest rates through its actions in the Senate. So there is nothing from this opposition, no plan, no platform, no macro-economic strategy to encourage growth. In the caucus task force report we acknowledge that the most important thing that we have to do is to encourage growth. That is the most substantial contribution that we can make to reduce overall levels of unemployment. I am pleased to say that the business community agrees with the government approach. I quote, for the honourable member for Indi, from an article in the recent edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Decisions</EMPHASIS> of the National Australia Bank by Mr Allan Diplock, Chief General Manager, NAB. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the latest year Australia's 630 stock-exchange listed companies have experienced their most profitable conditions for more than 10 years, with aggregate earnings rising by 145% in the period to a total of $10.7 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amid all the gloom and doom&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>from the opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which have accompanied many corporate reports since the recession began to take its toll in this country, that is more than a glimmer of hope, it is a bright ray of encouragement to Australia's corporate sector.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have the National Australia Bank acknowledging that the government's overall macro-economic settings are producing the profits and will produce the investment to generate long-term sustainable jobs in the private sector&mdash;and that is quoting the corporate sector. Perhaps I could quote for honourable members the comments from John Prescott at the National Press Club a couple of weeks ago, when he put to bed the other great furphy that the opposition constantly puts in this House: that somehow the level of wages in this country is an impediment to employment&mdash;what a nonsense&mdash;and that somehow the current Industrial Relations Reform Bill will stop job growth. That is not accepted by any practical head of large business in this country. It is only nonsense which flows from the ideologues who occupy the opposition benches and the ideologues who tend to work for the major business organisations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ideology of slashing wages, ideology of cutting into things like labour market programs is the last thing that the unemployed people in this country need or deserve from the opposition. The opposition went to the last election with its jobsback policy which put forward a very significant cut in labour market programs. In the whole time I have been in this House I have not heard boo from members of the backbench opposite about the need for labour market programs. The government is currently spending $1.3 billion a year on labour market programs, assisting over 500,000 individuals, and the opposition went to the last election with a policy of substantially cutting that expenditure by as much as $425 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases I have seen honourable members opposite support the comments of people like Professor Judith Sloan, who thinks that we do not need labour market programs at all because we have this economic fundamentalism that the cause of our problems simply lies in too much government spending and wages which are too high. That is simply not the case. The way ahead for this country is not the low wage, no social security safety net option put forward by the opposition. The way ahead is high levels of sustainable growth in the private sector. They are occurring and being brought about by the overall macro-economic settings of the government and, to cope with those that cannot be provided with work through high rates of growth, this government is prepared to put in place additional mechanisms to assist those people. We are currently spending $1.3 billion a year on labour market programs. </PARA>

So the opposition does not support the labour market programs and it does not support the macro-economic policy and the incentives to business which have been given in the recent budget.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill amends the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 to implement the amendment announced by the government on 24 June 1992 to exclude from eligibility claimants with criminal convictions under the corporations law or in respect of serious fraud, and certain claimants under schemes of arrangement. The bill provides also for firms to claim half yearly in the early stages of overseas marketing, and makes a number of `technical' amendments which protect the scheme's integrity and administrative efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The payment of grants to persons with criminal convictions under the Corporations Law or in respect of serious fraud is currently possible under the scheme. It is considered that the integrity of the scheme is at risk where it allows convicted persons access to public funds. The bill does not prevent persons with minor convictions from obtaining grants, only those who have been convicted of more serious offences under the Corporations Law, or in respect of fraud. For example, a company director who failed to lodge a company return by the appointed time is not excluded from the scheme. Whilst a criminal offence, this conviction, in isolation, does not assault the scheme's integrity in any serious way, and this display of flexibility is seen as preserving the underlying open access nature of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, it is considered that payment of grants to business operations with very low viability, and consequently low probability of any future benefit from export promotional expenditure, is not within the spirit of the scheme's intent. Although on occasions an insolvent claimant may eventually trade on to become a viable operation, this generally is not the case, and the legal and practical difficulties associated with assessing potential viability are considerable. Also, the scheme is essentially open access and does not attempt to determine this viability on the basis of value judgments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Half yearly claims lodgment is seen as a very practical method of assisting exporters' cash flow in the early stages of overseas market development. The scheme has operated very successfully for nineteen years, with the only significant criticism being the delay between the incurring of expenditure by the exporter, and the payment of the grant. This bill provides for earlier payment of grants based on the provision to lodge half yearly claims in respect of exporters' first three full grant years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great strength of the scheme is the freedom it affords exporters to make judgments as to the activities they wish to pursue, and the markets they wish to target. This premise, and the need for containment of administrative cost, means that some delay in payment is inevitable. Half yearly claims lodgment, however, provides the framework which could double the frequency of payments without altering the essential parameters of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also implements a number of `technical' amendments to the act. These amendments are essentially administrative and are required to clarify the established intention of the legislation, or assist with the tightening of ongoing risk management.

<PARA>This bill is an omnibus measure proposing amendments to the Customs Act 1901, the Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Act 1992 and the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping Amendments) Act 1992. The main proposals contained in the bill relate to:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now briefly outline the proposed changes:</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(1) Rules of Origin</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments to the rules of origin effected by Clause 10 of the bill are a response to the government's agreement to the outcome of the 1992 review of the Australia-New Zealand closer economic relations trade agreement, ANZCERTA. The proposed amendments also extend the administrative and technical aspects of that agreement to other preference arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rules of origin are those rules which previously appeared in section 151 of the Customs Act 1901, to determine whether particular goods imported into Australia are eligible for entry at preferential rates of duty. Clause 10 of the bill inserts a new division 1A of part VIII into the act to provide a better defined and more predictable basis for calculating the origin of goods. The concept of `factory or works' cost of goods as calculated in accordance with rules set out in Gazette notices issued by the comptroller, has been replaced by specific provisions contained in the act, that is, new sections 153C to 153G. Furthermore, the bill includes diagrams and explanatory notes in a new schedule inserted in the act as a means of illustrating the operation of the rules of origin in their application to New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to New Zealand, it should be noted that there is some modification of the rules of origin in certain circumstances. New section 153K of the act implements the agreement between Australia and New Zealand to allow a two per cent margin of tolerance in meeting the usual 50 per cent area content requirement, where an unforeseen circumstance&mdash;such as an adverse movement in exchange rates&mdash;would otherwise result in a shipment failing to qualify for preference. The amendment is intended to assist manufacturers in such unforeseen circumstances, whilst ensuring that the preferential trade benefits of ANZCERTA are not diverted away from Australian and New Zealand manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments peculiar to New Zealand modify the treatment of materials of mixed origin to allow the area content of such materials to contribute to the area content of the final product in circumstances where otherwise they would not. The amendments will make the rules of origin more objective in their application and should overcome weaknesses in the previous provisions which had enabled some claimants for preference to circumvent the spirit of the rules. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(2) Timor Gap</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in clause 5 of the bill are a response to concerns that the customs barrier controls&mdash;reporting of cargo, passengers and crew&mdash;do not presently cover the movement of persons and goods to and from area A of the zone of cooperation, being that area in the Timor Sea in respect of which Australia and Indonesia have agreed to cooperate in the exploration for and exploitation of any petroleum resources. The proposed amendments to the current definition of `place outside Australia' therefore extend customs barrier controls over movements to and from area A of the zone of cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(3) Undeclared Possessions of Ship's Crew</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From an operational point of view, it is desirable for customs officers to have the ability to require information as to the possessions of ship's crew and for there to be a sanction for not fully declaring those possessions which represents a real deterrent to non-compliance. If there is no penalty for non-compliance, there is no incentive for crew members to ensure they fully report their belongings to customs and that could encourage crew to secrete prohibited or dutiable goods with the intention of smuggling the goods ashore at some later time during the ship's stay in port. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 6 of the bill proposes an amendment to section 64AA of the Customs Act to specifically include a report of the possessions of the ship's crew in the ship's arrival report and create a statutory requirement for full disclosure of all crew belongings. If such belongings are not declared and are subsequently found secreted in a crew member's cabin, they can be regarded as forfeited goods under paragraph 229(1)(e) of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the amendments outlined above, the bill proposes a number of minor technical amendments which essentially correct cross-references between provisions and citation errors.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind honourable members that when the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) was debated in this chamber in September the coalition had serious concerns regarding the original clause 4 of the bill. At that time the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), quoted the Public Service Act and the Freedom of Information Act as precedents for the clause protecting the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe) from defamation action. At the committee stage of the debate, my colleague the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), commented on those precedents and assertions at the committee stage of the bill in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If one looks first at the Public Service Act provision, it can be seen that this is a provision which protects a person in the preparation of a report in the course of employment where it is done in good faith. It is not a provision that relates to the publication of a report; it relates to the preparation. One might want to argue that, in that respect, it merely restates the common law. To that extent, it might be suggested validly that it constitutes a precedent, but it is not in any way relevant to a situation where, a report or statement having been prepared in the ordinary course of the work of a department, the minister then elects to make it public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is that issue which is addressed in the proposed addition to section 14J of the principal Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at section 91 of the Freedom of Information Act, one finds that this also does not relate to the publication of a document at all, except in a very narrow sense. It provides that no action for defamation or other specified forms of action lies against the Commonwealth, an agency, a minister or an officer by reason of the authorising or giving of the access to a document pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a general publication; that is almost tantamount to a private publication because it is made to one person: an applicant. It is not, in that sense, as it is under the proposed addition to section 14J, a general publication or the making of information or a statement available to the public.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Tangney went on to suggest that neither provision constitutes a precedent for what is being sought to be done here. The coalition maintained its view that there were no precedents for this action, and questioned, firstly, why the government felt that it was necessary in this case and, secondly, what actions have been taken against the minister in the past to make this clause necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister for public housing and community services, Senator Tambling, has received representations from some very concerned organisations in the disability portfolio area. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services did not consult with the organisations which represent people with disabilities about this clause. As a result, those organisations were extremely concerned that the minister may well use this particular clause in a way that would lead to serious reductions in the rights of disability organisations and their members. The coalition is appalled that the government tried to use the Disability Services Act to try to slip in this precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have received representations from ACROD, a peak disability organisation, and from the Association for Disability Employment, Placement and Training Ltd, ADEPT. The points made in those letters raise very serious issues of concern and appear on pages 2642 to 2643 of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Hansard</EMPHASIS> for Wednesday, 27 October 1993. At the end of my speech, I will seek leave to table these letters. Because of the hurried way I entered the chamber, I have not had the opportunity to show them to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), but I assure him that they are exactly the same letters as have been incorporated in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Given that this piece of legislation was debated in the House of Representatives on 29 September 1993, the government's response to our concerns and those of the disability organisations was very tardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the morning the legislation was to be debated in the Senate&mdash;27 October&mdash;Senator Tambling received a letter from the then parliamentary secretary asking for coalition support for the previous clause 4, which we are considering now. After Senator Lees, the Australian Democrats' spokesperson on community service matters, indicated that her party was also opposed to clause 4, a proposed government amendment to clause 4 emerged during the Senate luncheon break that day and was circulated, one month after the then parliamentary secretary had given a commitment in this chamber that the matter would be discussed further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is not convinced by the case made by the government for its amendment to clause 4. Let us examine the amendment put forward now. The replacement of clause 4 extends the common law to ensure that the publication of the minister's statement `in good faith' enjoys immunity from defamation. The coalition does not believe that the replacement amendment in any way adequately addresses the issues raised by the coalition in both chambers, and by peak disability organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have looked at the notes attached to the amendment put in the Senate. I have looked at the precedent that is quoted now and find it quite inconsistent with other precedents. The Senate was advised by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) that a precedent for this replacement clause is found in subsection 134A(4) of the National Health Act 1953. We need to look very carefully at this precedent. Subsection 134A(4) refers to actions taken under sections 33, 35, 95 and 133 of the National Health Act 1953. It should be noted that sections 33 and 35 have now been deleted from the original act. Section 95 of the National Health Act allows that, after investigation and report by the appropriate committee of inquiry in order to reprimand a medical practitioner, the minister may publish particulars in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS>. Quite clearly, both sides of the case are heard&mdash;that of the government and that of the medical practitioner. Section 133 of the National Health Act relates to a medical practitioner, dental practitioner or approved pharmacist being charged before a court having committed an offence under the National Health Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very big difference between the defunding of disability services that are being provided and these so-called precedents; they relate to two different issues. A medical professional charged before a court has all other rights of appeal; similarly with an investigation and reprimand of a medical practitioner. They have certain rights of appeal that are not available in the process that is proposed here in this legislation for disability review standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look closely at the Disability Services Act 1986, we see that there is a fundamental flaw in this legislation. It would appear that under this act the disability standards review panel meets to review the funding situation of the disability services organisation. However, once the review panel meets and makes its recommendations on a disability service, there is no right of reply for the disability service provider by which it could defend itself against an unfortunate review. Therefore, the minister can make a statement without the disability service provider having any statutory right of defence, much less a right to put its case publicly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This present amendment to clause 4 is also unprecedented. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services is protected, anything that is published is protected, and the disability service provider has no right of reply. I fail to see how this can be considered fair for the disability service providers and their organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I accept that this amendment now before us may well improve the bill's original drafting and may seek to address some of the issues that I raised in debate here on 29 September, answers have not been given to the series of questions I put with regard to the need for the original clause 4. Honourable members will recall that the original justification for this clause was a very unusual provision to protect the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services. It was very much a matter of special protection. We have not been given any indication of the types of statements that could be made, said or subsequently published. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deleting clause 4 altogether would put the responsibility on to the Minister for Health, Local Government and Community Services to state the government's case in a non-defamatory manner, given that the statement may be made in the knowledge that some community organisations and others&mdash;for example, parents&mdash;may want to publish the material in the minister's report. It is still our concern and our suspicion that this legislation protects the minister in such a way that it is really nothing more than a licence to attack particular organisations. I refer to the letters from ACROD and the Association for Disability Employment, Placement and Training which have raised very serious concerns about this particular issue. The ADEPT letter states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Too often, services for people with disabilities have been attacked in the media with little, or no, foundation resulting in considerable damage to the services' reputation and the quality of service for people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crowley, in her closing comments in the Senate, also referred to a number of issues with regard to subsequent publication. Unfortunately, they only take us back to the point of irony, the very point of intent, that the minister has made a statement that is defamatory and its subsequent promulgation by others, therefore, needs statutory protection. Regarding this proposed replacement clause, Senator Crowley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . people with a disability, their families and carers may never know if the service they use or want to use falls short of accepted standards.</PARA>
<PARA>I accept that it is information that the minister should make available, but it does not need to be done in a defamatory manner. It is inherently consistent and proper for the government and the minister to ensure that it is not done in a defamatory way. The government's proposed amendment dodges this issue. It still contains this very fundamental flaw. It does not alleviate the concerns being expressed by the disability service providers. It is a great pity that the Australian Democrats did not support the coalition in opposing the government amendment to clause 4 in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not support the amendment proposed by the government. In fact, we would argue that the only way to properly achieve the proper outcomes&mdash;the equity, the fairness and the justice to all concerned&mdash;is to support the original action taken by the coalition in both the House of Representatives and in the Senate; namely, that this proposal has no place in this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am at something of a disadvantage here because normally this would be handled by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health but, as members would be aware, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) stood aside after question time today. On the specific issue of the question of precedent, I am advised that in addition to the 134A precedent there are a number of other similar provisions in commonwealth legislation, particularly section 82W of the National Health Act 1953, and sections 23DL, 106G, 124S and 106AA of the Health Insurance Act 1973. I am also advised that similar provisions were passed in the time of the Fraser government; for example, section 32 of the Companies Act 1981 when we conferred immunity from defamation action with respect to the publication of audit reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there may be some erosion of the common law rights of named organisations, this is caught by two considerations: firstly, parties who publish statements otherwise than in good faith will not be immune from a defamation action and, secondly, self-help groups and parent networks will be able to publish information without running the risk of appearing in court and dealing with the question of whether or not they enjoy the defence of fair report. By removing this uncertainty, the replacement clause will promote greater openness and sharing of information about the quality and service of organisations than would otherwise be the case. This is in the interests of consumers, their families and friends and carers in the community generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, am at a bit of a disadvantage, as is the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), in that the precedents that are now quoted with some alacrity and speed have not previously been placed before either of the chambers of this parliament. This bill has been under debate since September of this year. The government has had more than six weeks in which to put this information before the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the bill was originally debated in this House, in September, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), gave us references to some acts which, it was claimed by the advisers, contained precedents. With great hurry and scurry we were able to get copies of the sections of those acts. The shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), rushed into the chamber, looked at them and gave the reply that I have already quoted, in part, in my earlier speech. They were found not to be precedents at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One month later the bill was debated in the Senate and, despite the parliamentary secretary having said that there would be an amount of consultation before the bill proceeded, the shadow minister received a letter only that day from the parliamentary secretary asking him to support the original clause. I cannot imagine why. Maybe he thought I was doing my own thing in here and it was worth a try. Of course, I was not. I was speaking on behalf of the coalition when I stated our opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Attorney-General stated in this chamber our views regarding the sections of acts which were claimed as precedents, but which were not in fact precedents. In debate in the Senate the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services, the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), brought forward another precedent&mdash;the National Health Act. Presumably there was a similar sort of hurry and scurry over there whilst the opposition availed itself of the relevant sections of the act, looked at them quickly, gave them some consideration and replied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now referred to more sections of various acts. I have to ask what is going on. I really cannot give any credence to the sections that the minister has this minute been given by the advisers to quote here. Those given to the parliamentary secretary six weeks ago and those given to Senator Crowley in the other chamber three weeks ago were wrong. I must say that in my years in this place, both in government and in opposition, I have seen ministers go through this little exercise. I well remember a case where some rather controversial whaling legislation came in under the Fraser government, and we were all handed a page of acts that were said to be precedents. Every one of them was incorrect; none of them was a precedent for the proposal that the minister had, in good faith, made before the House, believing that the precedents were justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that the advisers are fibbing. I am saying that I think on the balance of probabilities they are wrong&mdash;certainly on the basis of previous experience with this bill. Since we have been having this argument about this bill for the past two months, it should not have taken until 5.15 this afternoon to finally find the precedent. It should have been before us long ago. I am sorry, but if I have to choose between being given the advice that we have been given here, and the advice of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney, then I am going to go with the shadow Attorney-General because he was right on previous occasions and he maintains the view that there is no such precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point at issue is that the coalition does not in any way dispute the right of users of disability services to have access to information that they properly need to make certain judgments. We accept that the minister and public servants already have a qualified privilege, or a legislative privilege, against defamation actions when certain actions are taken. But we assert that it is not necessary for the minister to state the reasons and give the necessary facts in a defamatory way. Organisations are concerned because in the past some of them have been under quite vicious personal attack from certain individuals&mdash;including members in this chamber. They do not have the right of reply that is available to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the minister quotes the National Health Act, I have to wonder whether those precedents are not in the same vein as the precedents under the National Health Act that were claimed previously in debate in the Senate and which I have already dealt with here. That act included rights of reply, rights of appeal and even rights of litigation in certain cases before certain action was taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that the government is pursuing this. I reiterate: it must be possible for the minister to put the facts as to why providers are no longer to be funded, or whatever, in a non-defamatory way. Those facts would then be available to interested community organisations who could pass them on to their members, or other interested people, without being defamatory. I reiterate, therefore, that we will oppose this clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 seeks to amend the 1948 Citizenship Act. It is particularly important legislation because it deals with citizenship. But it is not as important as it could have been if the government had thoroughly and properly reviewed the Citizenship Act and brought forward some useful proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill purports to insert a preamble to give recognition to the significance of Australian citizenship. It also seeks to replace the current oath and affirmation of allegiance with a pledge of commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia. The replacement of the current oath will remove all reference to the Queen of Australia as head of state. That commitment will be made by people taking out Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, we are given to understand, also makes some minor technical amendments to the act to replace references to `oath' or `affirmation' where they occur by reference to `pledge of commitment'. This is not the first occasion the government has attempted to remove reference to the Crown from the oath or affirmation. The Whitlam government attempted to remove it in 1973 and the Hawke government tried in 1984. On those occasions it was defeated in the Senate. Regrettably, on this occasion, the bill was introduced first in the Senate and has been passed there by one vote, 33 to 32. I suspect that in those circumstances, unless the government is persuaded by this debate, we will see the passage of the bill&mdash;given its composition&mdash;through this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want you to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the opposition will oppose this bill vigorously for a number of substantial reasons. The first and most substantial reason is that this proposal puts the cart before the horse. If those opposite were really mindful of changing fundamentally to whom we swear an oath as head of state, surely they would first attempt to change the constitution&mdash;if they seriously believed this was the appropriate way to go&mdash;and garner the support of the Australian population through a referendum. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear what my colleague has to say. But logic suggests that that is the only proper way to embark upon a reform of this sort. It worries me even more that the government has left unattended a whole host of other issues, and I will be addressing them during this debate. If it had been prepared to embark on a fundamental review of the Citizenship Act, it may well have brought forward substantial amendments worthy of support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a point of substance and concern now, at the beginning of my contribution&mdash;a point made to me by a lawyer from Victoria. It concerns the view that an oath or affirmation can be sound only if it is sworn to the head of state in accordance with the requirements of our constitution. The constitution has some points to make about the head of state and who occupies that position; and about his or her role and that of his or her delegates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that if people have been given important rights&mdash;and citizenship is an important right&mdash;on an oath that is flawed because it is not an oath to a head of state, the head of state prescribed by our constitution, people could well be put at risk; not only if they leave Australia and do not have re-entry visas because they did not think they needed one, but also in terms of other rights and entitlements that might flow from citizenship. They could have given up, by purporting&mdash;invalidly&mdash;to have taken up citizenship in Australia, rights to citizenship in other countries. They could have given up rights to property and other interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this could occur because people have been encouraged to rely upon citizenship that could be obtained through a system of affirmation that does not comply with the requirements of the constitution. That is a serious matter, one which ought to be of concern, because we will not know&mdash;until a challenge is launched to the very basis on which a person might hold citizenship&mdash;whether that has been put at risk. All of this is for a philosophical objective. The government is simply saying, `We might not be able to get a referendum through, but we can change the act'. That is why this bill ought to be defeated. We ought not put people at risk in relation to such a matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the point I started with, it is also important to note that the government has failed to address the much needed reforms to the Australian Citizenship Act so that it better reflects what it means to be Australian, with the privileges and obligations of citizenship; in particular a statement of our unifying commitment to Australia, its basic institutions, values and principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current oath is clear in that there is a requirement for loyalty and support to Australia through its head of state, under the constitution. That person is the Queen of Australia. In my view, the more appropriate way to look at this matter would be to propose any amendment to the constitution that the government has in mind through a referendum rather than by changing this act of parliament before there are any firm proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A leader of the Anglican Church in Australia, Archbishop Peter Hollingworth&mdash;he has not often been accused of being a raving conservative, having been the head of the Brotherhood of St Laurence&mdash;has articulated, for a long time, concerns about the most vulnerable and needy in our community. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is good reason for changing words or formulae if they give a wrong impression, or the original meaning has changed or if there is widespread objection based on conscience.</PARA>
<PARA>Does the existing oath of allegiance or affirmation offend in these ways? The swearing of an oath goes right to the heart of human belief. To take an oath is to highlight the solemn seriousness, power and efficiency with which a person's own word becomes endowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the oath or affirmation is not the primary matter that needs to be addressed in this debate; there are other issues of substance. The principal concern which needs to be addressed today is the failure of the Citizenship Act to offer and provide guidance to citizens on the rights and obligations of citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1948, the Australian Citizenship Act was introduced. It has not been the subject of any fundamental review since that time. It is purely mechanical in that what it seeks to do is describe how to become an Australian citizen, how citizenship can be lost and how it can then be regained. But the act fails to define the rights and responsibility that Australian citizenship entails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because we were formerly British subjects the view was that we all knew what it was to be a British subject. When the concept of citizenship was introduced, we did not have to seek to set it out in the Citizenship Act at that time. In my previous capacity as shadow minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, I was very critical of the act&mdash;as honourable members might know&mdash;and I called for a fundamental review of it. I was quite interested to read fairly recently the text of some debate in a Senate committee reviewing this issue of citizenship and the Citizenship Act. Appearing before it was our former colleague, Senator Tate, who was offering some advice on how he came to propose the amendments before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was quite surprised to find myself being quoted with authority in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Former Senator Tate, on 23 June 1993 when he came to accept responsibility for the Citizenship Act, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I very early came to the view that Philip Ruddock was correct in his criticism of the Act. He had made it known in various press releases over a period of years that the Act did not in itself signify any unifying commitment to Australia, and that it was just a technical outline of the steps that would be taken to acquire, to relinquish or to have stripped from one the status of citizenship. There was no sense of what it meant to be a citizen or any great sense of the meaning to be acquired through the citizenship ceremony.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that he decided to look at the question of the oath of allegiance. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I got hold of all of Philip Ruddock's press releases in which he expressed the view I have just mentioned that there was a lack of a unifying commitment to Australia in the citizenship Act.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish he had not only got them out but also read them, and read them adequately. If I could go back to my first press release&mdash;I must admit he was fairly generous to say I had been doing this over a series of years; the first one was dated Sunday, 26 January 1992, Australia Day&mdash;I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Citizenship Act is in need of fundamental review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">it requires a clear statement of purpose outlining the rights and obligations of citizenship;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is appropriate on Australia Day to reflect on the meaning and importance of citizenship. In many citizenship ceremonies around the country today people will be pondering the nature of the commitment they have made to this nation and just what it means.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is said that the act of gaining citizenship bestows upon people equal rights and duties, liberties and constraints, powers and responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Citizenship Act (1948) is the place where one would expect a comprehensive statement about the nature of these obligations and entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regrettably this is not the case. The Act does contain technical details . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I have said most of that before. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It tells us that there is a citizenship ceremony; that applicants are required to say they will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil their duties as an Australian citizen, but nowhere does the Act say what those duties are. Nowhere does it say what rights are achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a shallow concept of citizenship begs the question: What does it mean to be Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In most public documents, Australia is identified as having a community commitment to various institutions and values; these include parliamentary democracy, the rule of law and equality before the law, freedom of the individual, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, equality of women, equal opportunity for all and universal education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such values are fundamental to us. But it is not clear that they are overriding in relation to some values brought from elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some are enshrined in our constitution such as freedom of religion, the separation of powers doctrine and some aspects of parliamentary democracy. Others are in discreet legislation, such as discrimination laws, while others are in policy documents such as the National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But nowhere in legislative form are these brought together.</PARA>
<PARA>I looked again at the national agenda for a multicultural Australia and at each of the concepts which we in the opposition, in a bipartisan way, have affirmed over and over again. Then I find in this proposal that the government has introduced a preamble. What does it say in relation to those substantial matters? It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . citizenship represents formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian citizenship is a common bond, involving reciprocal rights and obligations, uniting all Australians, while respecting their diversity; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Persons granted Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and undertake to accept these obligations</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">by pledging loyalty to Australia and its people, and </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">by sharing democratic beliefs, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">by respecting their rights and liberties, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">by upholding and obeying the laws of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In terms of the substantial matters that I mentioned, it in no way reflects the substance and the importance of each of those. It does not even pick up all the elements of the government's own national agenda for a multicultural Australia if we were trying to give it some meaning and substance in an act of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never advocated that it ought to be a bill of rights. Some people have suggested it could be seen that way. A preamble to legislation is an appropriate way to deal with these matters but, quite frankly, that is as weak a statement as I could have imagined. As the person whom the minister responsible gave credit to, I am grossly disappointed with the way my ideas have been reflected. They are quite happy to accept that I was the originator of it&mdash;I thank the minister for that&mdash;but the fact is it in no way does justice to the concepts that I, as the author, thought ought to be there. I do not claim originality for those concepts. I do not claim to be the originator of our constitution and the basic doctrines therein. I do not claim to have written the other discrete legislation I referred to. I do not even claim to be the author of the national agenda for a multicultural Australia, but those concepts have not been picked up in any way, shape or form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it very clear that it was important to us in the opposition when we raised these issues in our policy document on citizenship that we saw this as an important objective. I want to quote from the policy. All too often people on the other side are prepared to say that in some way we are lacking in policy. Some of my party supporters think there was no shortage of policy, and perhaps there was a surfeit of it. There was no lack of policy. We had some substantial statements to make about the areas in which reform ought to be undertaken and the way in which one ought to be prepared to address these issues. I will come to that in a little while. Under the topic `Citizenship', it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians and new settlers value our society for its egalitarianism, its peacefulness and security, the rule of law, democracy, its lack of barriers to self betterment and the freedom and opportunities for the individual. These unique attributes are esteemed along with other unifying values.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not the intention of a future Liberal/National Government to force residents into accepting citizenship, but to encourage them to recognise that there are both responsibilities and benefits attached to making that final commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition believes that the fundamental strengths of our cultural diversity ought to be recognised and preserved within an overarching framework of common values.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to achieve this, the Coalition has proposed the incorporation of a statement which spells out clearly the rights and obligations of citizenship during the citizenship ceremony.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a declaration could reaffirm an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia; it could specify that the right to express one's own culture and beliefs involves a reciprocal responsibility to accept the right of others to express their views and values. It could also signify respect and acceptance of the principles of non-discrimination on the basis of race, sex, colour, religion or national or ethnic origin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A clear and unambiguous statement about the rights and obligations of citizenship in the context of a culturally diverse society, will ensure that we can build productively and fairly upon our unique heritage.</PARA>
<PARA>They are very worthy and appropriate statements of the commitment that we gave to undertake a fundamental review of this legislation. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) announced in the 1993 election campaign that we were going to embark upon such a review. He announced that the coalition would establish a national council on citizenship to advise on a clear and unambiguous statement of rights and obligations of citizenship in the context of a multicultural society and that the council would be chaired by a prominent Australian and would consult widely with the community. They were raised as proper matters in the context of that debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other matter in our policy that I want to draw attention to is the problem of dual citizenship, particularly in relation to the current disadvantage experienced by Australian citizens who wish to accept citizenship rights of other countries. The fact of the matter is that the whole issue of dual citizenship has never been seriously addressed by government in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to advert to dual citizenship in the context of this debate because it is one of the matters that I think require urgent review. There are now very pressing problems emerging that are, I think, more appropriate for the government's time than is fiddling around with the oath and affirmation of allegiance. The common law principle that a person can hold dual citizenship is generally accepted. Australian law recognises that an Australian citizen may hold citizenship or nationality of another country. For example, section 18(5) of the Citizenship Act provides that during war a declaration made renouncing citizenship by a person who is a national or citizen of a foreign country may be refused. Section 10B(1) provides that a person born outside Australia of parents one of whom is an Australian citizen may have his or her name registered at an Australian consulate and thereafter be recognised as an Australian citizen and, of course, recognised as a citizen of the country in which that person is born. So our act of parliament clearly recognises dual nationality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem came to notice very clearly recently in the matter of the Wills by-election and the challenge that ensued. Of course, in that case it was said that the citizenship of another country held jointly with Australian citizenship under section 44(i) of our constitution could preclude people from sitting in the Australian parliament for other reasons outlined in that section of the constitution. I know the government says it is going to look at that matter in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the substantial matter I want to address. The substantial matter I want to address relates to section 17 of the Citizenship Act, which limits acquisition of foreign citizenship by Australians. Section 17(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person, being an Australian citizen who has attained the age of 18 years, who does any act or thing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the sole or dominant purpose of which; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the effect of which;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is to acquire the nationality or citizenship of a foreign country, shall, upon that acquisition cease to be an Australian citizen.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, any Australian who leaves this country and&mdash;or, presumably, in this country&mdash;undertakes an act the sole or dominant purpose of which is and the effect of which are to acquire the citizenship or nationality of another country ceases to be an Australian. So we have this double standard. People who have migrated to Australia can keep their old citizenship, but Australians who go abroad and take up citizenship of another country lose their Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the best known example of that is one of our most famous Australian entrepreneurs, Mr Rupert Murdoch, who had to forgo his Australian citizenship even though he heads a very prominent company. I hold no brief for Rupert Murdoch in relation to this matter, but he is a person who, in order to be able to pursue business interests in the United States, had to take out US citizenship and lost his Australian citizenship as a consequence of section 17(1). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other cases. I have had a very difficult case brought to my attention fairly recently of a lady who married and wanted to retain her Australian citizenship, but in the country in which she is resident with her husband unless she takes out citizenship of his country she will not be able to inherit any of his property. If she is later widowed, she could be at risk of not even being able to come back to Australia. As a woman living in a society that does not see equality of the sexes in the same way as we do, she would not be able to exercise the same sorts of rights because as a woman on her own she might well be disadvantaged vis-a-vis other individuals in that society. It might be said that she could take up her citizenship again or she may be able to migrate to Australia, but there is often doubt as to whether or not that right will exist, and sometimes it is discretionary. All the advice that that woman has is that she has no rights to reacquire her Australian citizenship, but, if she retains Australian citizenship and is widowed, she will forfeit all her rights to receive property through her husband's estate. I find that a pretty telling matter of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other matter that is of concern to me in relation to the administration of this matter, and I have taken it up fairly recently with the department. I will not refer to the individuals involved. I suppose in a sense one ought to take great credit from the fact that as a result of the recent events that have transpired in Cambodia people who have lived in Australia over a long period, who came to Australia either as refugees or migrants, settled here and took out Australian citizenship&mdash;in one case became a very senior public servant so highly regarded that he was sent abroad by Australia to play a role in Cambodia in the peace process&mdash;have been able to return there. I understand that three Australian citizens have been sworn in as ministers in the Cambodian government. I do not know what steps individuals could take that are more at odds with their entitlement to Australian citizenship and their loyalty and commitment to Australia first and foremost, if that is what this hangs on, than to take up a position as a minister in a foreign government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that these people have advised us that being a minister in a foreign government and being an Australian citizen are incompatible and have asked to have citizenship relinquished. If that is so, perhaps the appropriate minister can inform us, but I suspect not. As I understand it, we have no knowledge of what is the outcome of the law in Cambodia. As I understand it, we have no knowledge as to whether or not the law in Cambodia deals with citizenship. So, if the law in Cambodia does not deal with citizenship, they may not have had to take an oath or affirmation of allegiance to Cambodia, the sole or dominant purpose of which was to acquire nationality or citizenship of that country because there is no law that deals with it. But others who go to a country where the law does deal with it lose their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I am not trying to be judgmental in relation to these matters. I am simply drawing them to attention. I am drawing them to attention because, quite frankly, if we are not prepared to address the difficult issues in relation to citizenship and to have a proper review of it, why are we tinkering around with this act in a way which might put at risk the rights of Australians if the oath or affirmation of allegiance is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Australian constitution? Why do we have to pursue that objective? It seems to me that the only reason we are pursuing that objective is that the government has another agenda. It wants to make a political statement. It does not care about the risk. It does not care about the fundamental issues that need reviewing. It wants to make a statement about whether or not constitutional reform ought to proceed at some time in the future. I think the government ought to have had the courage of its convictions, if that is what it believes, and brought the issue forward and had a proper debate before the Australian community pursued the matter at a referendum. Then we would all know where we stand in relation to it. But this business of fiddling around at the sides in a piecemeal fashion does Australia no good service and it does the reputation of the government no good service. I think the government ought to rethink this legislation right now and withdraw it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the honourable member for Berowra, this is not a question whereby if we go a necessary part of the way we are somehow doing something wrong. We are not. It is true that some big issues in the area of citizenship need to be addressed by this parliament in the next few years. This legislation is an important beginning. I remind the House about the trouble we have had getting any agreement from the opposition about anything to do with citizenship at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra said that, on the one hand, the bill does not go far enough and we really need to do a lot more about citizenship; and, on the other hand, he said that what is being done here might not work, might be unconstitutional, and people might end up not really being Australian citizens. I put it to the honourable member for Berowra that that is nothing more than a scare campaign. He knows very well that the bill is constitutional and that the people who take this pledge will be able to say that they are Australian citizens under the constitution. They will be able to say that because the pledge contains an excellent form of wording. I remind the House of what it says. It says:</PARA>

<PARA>That is the aim. There is nothing wrong with that. The honourable member for Berowra suggests that it does not go far enough. He mentioned the national agenda for a multicultural Australia. I will come back to that. He mentioned various forms of legislation that perhaps could be incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking here about a small pledge; we are not talking about a huge document. It may be that each of the points in the pledge needs to be expanded into a more generalised commitment that could be studied in schools, explaining what we mean by Australian citizenship. Perhaps that is what we ought to do. Perhaps we should take every point in the new pledge and expand it so that Australian citizens, especially school children, understand what we are getting at. That is not a bad idea; it is a good idea. But a pledge that is to be taken at a citizenship ceremony has to be small and must encapsulate the basic essence of the matter. I put it to the honourable member for Berowra that the pledge does encapsulate the essence of the matter. I will explain why I say that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been trying to define Australian citizenship for a long time. Every time we have a debate like this in the parliament it is an opportunity for us to think about, and reflect on, what we mean by Australian citizenship. The whole concept of citizenship, not only in Australia but throughout the world, is changing. It is changing in a very fundamental respect. This bill is extremely progressive because it encapsulates that change. Why is that so? It refers to both the unity of Australians and to their cultural diversity&mdash;in other words, to multiculturalism; to the multicultural nature of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are incorporating into the bill a commitment to Australia as a multicultural nation. That is very important because there are many nations on this planet which unfortunately define citizenship in a very monocultural way, in a very narrow, ethnic way. As a consequence of that narrow, ethnic definition and that monocultural definition, we have a situation where national and ethnic arrogance develops and especially a feeling that some ethnicity or some cultural form is superior to another. Consequently, we find the idea that citizenship is defined in this narrow, ethnic way. As a result of that, we get the sorts of conflicts we have seen recently in many of the countries of eastern Europe, where there is excessive nationalism and excessive emphasis on identifying citizenship with one narrow concept of ethnicity or one narrow concept of culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, through this bill, we have taken a revolutionary and different path. But instead of the honourable member for Berowra saying, `I welcome the fact that this bill incorporates a commitment to multiculturalism', he says, `It doesn't actually incorporate every element of the national agenda for a multicultural Australia'. That may be so, but that is a pretty long agenda. The reality is that the national agenda for a multicultural Australia is about the fundamental commitment of this nation to multiculturalism. That is incorporated in the pledge. We should herald this legislation because of that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the honourable member for Berowra is correct when he says that it does not incorporate the essential elements of the national agenda, because it does. The concepts of unity and diversity are both incorporated here. There is the concept of the commitment to the sharing of democratic beliefs. While we believe in cultural diversity, we accept that cultural diversity within the context of a commitment to a democratic nation where every person has equal rights and liberties. That is in fact stated. Because of that commitment to equal rights and liberties, we also have a commitment to our democratic institutions which involves not only the parliament but also the processes of election, free and fair elections, and the equality of the vote for every person. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is quite accustomed to interjecting on me. As I was saying, we have a historic opportunity and we are taking it in the definition of citizenship. But if the honourable member for Berowra had been listening to my initial comments, he would have heard me say that we certainly see this as part of an ongoing development of the concept of citizenship. Even though we have incorporated these new and important elements, this does not mean that the debate about citizenship in Australia has finished&mdash;far from it. In a vibrant, evolving, multicultural nation, a nation which is one of the developing nations, naturally the concept of citizenship is developing. In our universities and in many of the multicultural and ethnic forums, these matters are being debated, discussed and developed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra referred to the question of social issues. I would like to see the day when, as I said before, we have not merely the pledge but also an additional full statement of all the implications of what is involved in being an Australian citizen. In such a full statement&mdash;and I am expressing a personal view&mdash;I would like to see us make a commitment not merely to the formal democratic political rights, but also to certain fundamental social rights. In fact I have argued this case in a recent publication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should see social issues such as equality of the sexes; access and equity; social justice questions such as the right to a decent income if unemployed, the right to be looked after if disabled and a decent health system for everyone. All these social rights, which are important in any social democracy, which Australia is, need to be further incorporated as we evolve our concept of citizenship. It is clear&mdash;it was one of the main, central questions in the last federal election&mdash;that the Australian people believe certain social rights to be fundamental, not peripheral, to the process, such as the commitment to a universal health system, as Medicare is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain social rights are conceived as fundamental and those social rights should be part of our ongoing development of our concept of an Australian and an Australian citizen. I believe that we should have that discussion. I am happy to have further discussions with the honourable member for Berowra. He initiated discussions in the beginning of the debate by saying that on the one hand he thought the bill should not be making these changes, but then on the other hand said that it should incorporate all these other principles. Let us have further positive and constructive discussion about how we might incorporate further principles in the concept of citizenship. But the honourable member for Berowra said that he is going to oppose these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get to the real essence of the matter: why is the honourable member for Berowra opposing the changes? It is because we are taking out the reference to the Queen as the head of state. That is the real reason why he is objecting to these changes. We are saying that the commitment is to the Australian people, to the Australian nation, to the Australian democracy, to the basic rights of people&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra said that this is just a sneaky way of trying to get some constitutional changes through. There is only one way of changing the constitution and that is by referendum, so these are not constitutional changes. But interpretations of the constitution are the business of the parliament. I do not believe that the High Court or anyone else is going to rule these changes invalid&mdash;far from it. If the honourable member for Berowra thought that was going to be the case, then he would have made that point. The reality is that he said we should not be bringing in these constitutional changes. His comments implied that there was something wrong with Australia discussing constitutional changes. Members of the opposition have to understand that, whether they like it or not, as we move towards the year 2000 there will be discussion on constitutional changes in this country. There will be discussion on a whole range of constitutional changes and that discussion is a necessary discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra talks a lot about his commitment to democracy. If he looks at the Australian constitution&mdash;the actual document&mdash;he will see that there are many changes that are required for that document to even reflect the current democratic practice of this nation. That is not my view; that is the view of an overwhelming number of political scientists and constitutional lawyers in this country. The constitutional document, as it stands, is outmoded and outdated. It does not even refer to ministers. It does not even refer to the Prime Minister. It does not even refer to the formation of the cabinet, et cetera. The document reads as if the government of Australia is run by the Governor-General. That is how the document reads. The document has very little to do with the actual concrete practice of Australian democracy as we know it today and as is accepted by both sides of parliament. So why should we not think about modernising the document to reflect, at the very minimum, the actual democratic practices that we have in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast majority of the people who came to this country from nations other than the United Kingdom are very concerned that those constitutional changes should take place to reflect the actual democratic practice. They like the democratic practice of Australia, but they want the constitutional document to reflect that. One of the key issues in reflecting that has to be the issue of citizenship. That is why this legislation is important. It takes us quite a long way along the path, but it also opens up new paths with respect to those changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) ought to be commended for introducing the bill. I do not know what the honourable member for Berowra was referring to when he said it should not have been introduced in the Senate. The minister for immigration is in the Senate, so why should it not be introduced in the Senate? It will be debated in both chambers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental point remains that we do have to have an ongoing discussion on citizenship. This bill provides us with a very important progressive step. From now on many Australians who previously had a problem making an oath to what they perceived to be merely a foreign monarch will now be able to make an oath to Australia&mdash;a pledge to Australia, the nation, the people and the democratic processes. This is a very important development and it is one which is necessary, but it is not the end of the process. I am looking forward, in the next few years in parliament, to many such changes that will modernise our constitution and our processes and bring us together as a nation. </PARA>

Since becoming Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) has, one time after another, attempted to undermine our various symbols and tried to rewrite our history. The crown has been gradually removed from many items of official stationery. The following quotes highlight the way he has attacked many of our national symbols. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 11 July 1993, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intolerable for Australia to have as its Head of State perpetually a British Monarch, particularly in terms of our national self-esteem and our position in Asia.</PARA>

<PARA>In the House in February 1992, the Prime Minister again expressed anti-British sentiments&mdash;and factually incorrect&mdash;when in relation to Britain he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . decided not to defend the Malaysian Peninsula, not to worry about Singapore and not to give us our troops back to keep ourselves from Japanese domination.</PARA>
<PARA>An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 27 April 1992, quoted the Prime Minister as attempting to rewrite history when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In April 1992 Keating in PNG attempted to re-write Australia's history by talking about the 1942 PNG campaign as `the first and only time we have fought against an enemy to prevent the invasion of Australia, to save the way of life we had built for ourselves'.</PARA>

<PARA>So the people of Australia have suffered since the election in March from the government attempting to rewrite history, attempting to undermine our very real national achievements and attempting to denigrate us as a nation and all that we have achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 is a very sad piece of legislation in which the government is seeking to remove yet another plank from our structure as a nation. The essence of the bill is that, if enacted, it will replace the current oath or affirmation with a pledge from which our head of state has been excluded. It also attempts to insert a preamble seeking to give some recognition to the significance of Australian citizenship. The bill is a classic example of how Labor seeks to undermine our fundamental institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, this is the third attempt by Labor to change the oath of allegiance. In 1973 the Whitlam government failed dismally, as it failed in so many other areas, to change the oath of allegiance for new citizens. In 1984, with the support of the Australian Democrats then led by Mr Chipp, we were able to prevent the Labor Party from removing the position of the head of state from the oath of allegiance. Unfortunately, the legislation before the House has already travelled through the Senate with the very narrow majority of 33 to 32. Sadly, the Australian Democrats have forsaken the position taken by Don Chipp when he was leader and, in this instance, sold out to the government. </PARA>

As the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) conceded earlier, the constitution cannot be changed without the acceptance of the Australian people; yet by marching into the parliament here the government has indeed sought to pre-empt that decision. Looking at the opinion polls, it is patently clear that the government is failing on this issue. An ever increasing percentage of Australians are looking at the Australian constitution, the freedom and the stability that our constitutional monarchy and system of government have delivered to the people of Australia and they are saying that it is simply not worth the risk. After all, the republican debate can be summed up in just a few words: it means more power to politicians and particularly to the Prime Minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not rubbish. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services and the government are prepared to throw people onto the legal scrap heap. They are prepared to have people take the new pledge and risk losing rights as a result. They could lose their existing citizenship and become stateless persons. They could lose their property overseas. This government, by indulging in an ideological obsession, is playing Russian roulette with the rights of proposed citizens of this country. The new pledge is a less firm commitment. Archbishop Hollingworth, a great Australian, has said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The swearing of an oath goes right to the heart of human belief. To take an oath is to highlight the solemn seriousness, power and efficacy with which a person's own word becomes endowed.</PARA>
<PARA>A pledge is a lesser commitment. Why at this time is the government seeking from people a lesser declaration of citizenship? These proposals weaken the act of citizenship. The opposition is quite happy for the Citizenship Act to be revised and improved. Unfortunately, the government has brought in a piecemeal set of proposals which do not seek to do what ought to be done in this area. The government's main aim is to remove the Crown from the oath of allegiance, so its preamble amounts to window-dressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people opposite might suggest that we are reactionary in this area. We are certainly not. The government has given credit to the honourable member for Berowra for the very many positive suggestions that he has made in the area of citizenship. The parliament should be supporting legislation which strengthens the Citizenship Act to better reflect what it means to be Australian, together with the privileges and obligations of citizenship and, in particular, the unifying commitment to Australia, its basic institutions, values and principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill now before the parliament fails on all counts. The proposed pledge would make the stated commitment at a citizenship ceremony one of the weakest in the world. It would be appropriate at this point to look at the American oath of allegiance. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, to whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very firm and solid commitment. We find that, instead of moving in that direction, or at least maintaining what we now have, the government is turning the act of becoming an Australian citizen into something which is wishy-washy; something which does not require a firm pledge of a substantive nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the government has shirked its responsibility of clearly looking at the many changes to the Citizenship Act suggested by the honourable member for Berowra. The substantive changes included in this legislation include the preamble, which is totally inadequate, and the removal of the monarch from the oath of allegiance. This bill is a mechanical bill. It fails to define the rights and responsibilities of Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has supported the introduction of a preamble but this one&mdash;I repeat&mdash;is totally unsatisfactory. It is also interesting to note that the bill provides for almost a quarter of a million dollars to be spent in the 1993-94 financial year to fund an information program to introduce the new pledge and preamble to the Australian community. This is nothing more than a slush fund for Labor to promote its own ideas on our institutions. By excluding any reference to our constitution and our constitutional monarchy the new pledge is deliberately divisive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the exclusion may have no legal force, its symbolic effect is to create two classes of Australian citizens: those who are born in Australia and by law owe allegiance to the Queen of Australia; and those who are overseas born and who do not owe the allegiance. It also adds confusion to the existing situation concerning statements of allegiance by different categories of Australians: new citizens, members of parliament, ministers from the Lavarch example, and the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We totally support a full review of the Citizenship Act. The coalition's policy in 1988&mdash;and taken to the 1990 election&mdash;stated that the requirements of acquisition and awarding of citizenship should be strengthened to ensure that intending citizens understand more fully the meaning of their commitment to Australia. It said that compared with most countries, Australia's citizenship requirements were one of the least rigorous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same things were included in the coalition's 1993 policy. The coalition proposed a major overhaul of the current Citizenship Act to better reflect Australian citizenship as a privilege which has an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia and its basic structures and principles. The coalition also proposed the incorporation of a statement which spells out clearly the rights and obligations of citizenship during the citizenship ceremony in order to affirm an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia. In January 1993, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) announced that a coalition government would establish a national council of citizenship to advise on a clear and unambiguous statement of the rights and obligations of citizenship in the context of a multicultural society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this legislation currently before the House, the government is seeking to put the cart before the horse.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fifty per cent. Australians from this situation&mdash;Australians by choice, not by birth&mdash;always are more conscious generally of the importance of citizenship. Undoubtedly, this change is needed. The past historical connection between Australia and Britain is certainly not what it was. This is an observable fact. Honourable members opposite may not like this fact, but they certainly cannot deny it. Let us look at the relationship between Australia and Britain in early 1944. I pick that time because it was the month of the foundation of the Liberal Party. At that time Australians could enter and leave Britain with ease to work or to study and, in 1944, to join each other's armed forces to face the common foe. Indeed, a few years earlier, Robert Menzies was even suggested as a replacement prime minister when Churchill's British enemies were upset with him. British migrants flooded into Australia freely and in vast numbers. They have done a great deal for this country, and I would be happy to see their numbers expand today and in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of Australia's trade was with Britain and the flow of people and sentiment between the two places was immense. In 1973, Britain made a choice between the Commonwealth, including Australia, and her European neighbours. She chose her neighbours, and entered the European Community. From that date, the British instigated rejection of Australia began. It is most important that this fact be noted and, bitter as it may be for those opposite, accepted as true. Britain made a judgment that her future lay with Europe and not her empire, which had evolved into a multicultural commonwealth. I do not criticise Britain for this. Each country must make its own decisions on its own future. The struggle in Britain was very fierce on this matter. However, at the end of the day, Britain chose France and Germany over New Zealanders and Australians. That is why Australians now line up at Heathrow with Afghans and Peruvians to have their entry visas carefully checked while the grandchildren of SS Generals breeze through, waving their European Community passports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our trade has now reached the stage where Australia's trade with South Korea is greater than Australia's trade with Britain. Personally, I regret this development of an estrangement from the close ties that formerly bound Australia and Britain. Yet it was Britain, not Australia, that said goodbye. In this age of rapidly developing world trading blocs, there is no reason why Britain could not have led the way in the 1950s and 1960s to development of such a free trade bloc within the worldwide commonwealth. However, by war's end, Britain had lost her energy, insight and self-confidence. She became fixated with Europe and steadily cast off Australia and the rest of the Commonwealth. Of course, Britain remained anxious to retain the showy husk&mdash;the royal trips, the invitations to the weddings, the Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings. All these performances were meant for British public consumption&mdash;the maintenance of morale in Britain herself. Britain now finds herself a province of a German dominated Europe. It is the fate that she wanted and freely chose for herself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings us to Australia. The internationally embarrassing behaviour of the parties opposite in their fawning over a Britain of 50 years ago has become excessive. I am reminded that when a separate Australian citizenship was introduced in 1948, the Liberal Party opposed it. Prior to 1948 we were British subjects. This had its advantages in personal movement between Australia and Britain and in the general atmosphere of a true family of nations that existed between Australia and Britain. This growth apart between Australia and Britain has shown up in the abolition of imperial honours, the Privy Council, British governors and governors-general, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">God Save the Queen</EMPHASIS>, the loyal toast, front page newspaper headline coverage of the British budget, belief in the better than average behaviour of members of the British royal family, and the British Queen's Christmas Day message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of Australia's citizenship is central to our definition of ourselves as a nation and how each of us sees himself or herself fitting into that nation. Honourable members opposite may not understand this because they still regard themselves as British subjects. History has now taken Britain into Europe and Australia into Asia. Each of us has been obliged to turn to his neighbours for trade, commerce and general cultural exchange. Whilst this is a good thing, and I certainly support the government's policy on interaction at all levels with Asia, the problem of residual strands with British constitutional arrangements needs to be faced. I would urge honourable members opposite to give up the fantasy of the British empire. Not even the British cling to it any more. It does not fool us one bit to wrap up this fantasy love affair with Britain's past by pretending to be Australians for constitutional monarchy. Is there any suggestion of any genuine Australian resident monarch? Europe is full of potential&mdash;currently unemployed&mdash;monarchs all with magnificent lines of descent from great and famous European kings. There are plenty of Hapsburgs, Romanovs, Bourbons, and even Bonapartes, available to do a proper job of constitutional monarch in the kingdom of Australia. Does anyone opposite suggest that we should find someone to do the job and live in Australia, marry an Australian, and have Australian children? Of course not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians for constitutional monarchy are really Australians for clinging to British imperial fantasies. I am not criticising Britain. No-one in British public life clings any longer to imperial fantasies. My criticism is of Australians who see our national citizenship as a subset of some giant empire. The absurdity of this obsession is well known to the British. It is not for nothing that Queen Elizabeth has indicated her understanding of Australia's position. It is a pity that she is unable to tell honourable members opposite to snap out of it. Somebody certainly needs to. </PARA>

This bill was introduced some time ago and is being debated now in the context of the wider issue of what has been called the redefinition of our national identity. We have been subjected to this process largely because of the obsession of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with change. This process is extremely divisive.

It has been observed&mdash;I think with some credibility&mdash;that a lot of this headlong rush is something of a smokescreen to cloud the real issues of the day.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech referred to a commitment to national unity but that, of course, turned out to be a bit of a sick joke because the whole effect of this sort of legislation, the whole effect of the republic debate, is to destroy national unity.

To use the parliamentary secretary's own words, not all Australians `relish our diversity'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Using my constituents as an example, I would say that the majority do not relish our diversity. For example, not all Australians believe in, or grasp with any enthusiasm, multiculturalism. It is a fact of life, but it is not something that all Australians are enthusiastic about. When we say those things, we are liable to have all sorts of accusations cast at us. However, it is a fact that some of those things are of concern to people. We should not downgrade the benefits that we have received over a very long period of time from those who have come to this country from other places.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other speakers have suggested that these changes should be put in the context of Australian society as they view it today. However, it is not a matter of simply changing the rules to suit those who are here. If we join a particular golf club, for example, we accept the existing rules. We do not join one day and then say, `We don't like the rules any more, so we will change them'. People come to Australia understanding, knowing and appreciating what Australia stands for. That is why they come here. They should understand what Australia is and, if they do not like what they see, they should not have come here in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's rushed approach in respect of this particular matter has caused resentment and it raises doubts about multiculturalism in the electorate at large. People see these changes as somehow pandering to that particular element. That is not uniting; that is dividing. That is perfectly clear to most Australians&mdash;certainly to many constituents who have contacted me about this whole issue. I am speaking in a broader context than just about this particular change that is proposed to the oath and affirmation of allegiance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, this is only the tip of the iceberg. This shows clearly the Prime Minister's intentions&mdash;if we did not already know them. The existing oath and affirmation are more distinctively Australian because of what they stand for and are valued by many Australians, if not the majority. They are as distinctly Australian as what is proposed in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this legislation is purely and simply an outworking of the Prime Minister's obsession. He acts like a man obsessed whenever these issues are raised. He is obsessed with pushing his own agenda at our cost. Perhaps it is essential that we have a debate about change, but I question the way the debate is being conducted. To bring this sort of legislation into this place at this time is provocative and offensive because it seeks to change something which the majority of Australian people may not want to change. The Prime Minister has no mandate for this change. He wants to get rid of the Queen; that is the point of this exercise.

The committee did not canvass in the debate whether we should have a republic or not&mdash;that might have been acceptable to the majority of Australians; just have a debate, and they would participate in it&mdash;it ran around the country talking about what sort of republic we should have. In other words, it treated the whole exercise largely as a fait accompli. The Australian people have paid for the privilege of that. The Prime Minister has spent $430,000 on that particular exercise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I can understand why the parliamentary secretary might be offended by these remarks: I imagine that they go pretty close to the bone. If the cap fits, she will just have to wear it. The Prime Minister has betrayed his own obsession with off-loading the monarchy from Australia which he expressed when he was in Ireland. That is what this bill proposes to do. It proposes to change the oath and affirmation of allegiance essentially to remove a reference to the Queen as the Queen of Australia. When the Prime Minister was in Ireland, he made the point that he disliked the Queen because he was a Catholic. How low can you go? Introducing that sort of sectarianism into this country at this time is further evidence of the man's divisiveness. He cannot help himself. If he removed himself from these debates, they would be far more rational&mdash;not only in respect of the change to the oath and affirmation but also in respect of just about every other issue that is on the agenda today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Prime Minister is the issue. I do not have to tell the parliamentary secretary that because, unless she has a very different constituency from most constituencies in Australia, that is the sort of input that she would be getting as well. Introducing that particular point to the debate, which the Prime Minister did&mdash;I am not doing it; I am quoting him&mdash;particularly affects many loyal Catholics in this country. When he made those remarks in Ireland, Catholics phoned my office and said that they wanted to completely disassociate themselves with any suggestion by the Prime Minister that to be Catholic was to be other than loyal to the Queen as the Queen of Australia. We need only to note that many southern Irish men and women served in the British forces between 1939 and 1945. They were highly regarded by the British, whom apparently the Prime Minister also dislikes so much. </PARA>

I do not know whether he was subject to the call-up or not&mdash;although he was in that particular age group; I assume that he missed out&mdash;but he does not even have respect, by and large, for those who I still believe have the greatest interest in this particular debate; that is, those returned service men and women who are still alive. As a group, with some very few exceptions, they are the ones who are most offended by the Prime Minister's proposal to change this particular oath and affirmation. They are also offended by his obsessive desire to change the flag and by his headlong rush to create an impression&mdash;particularly when he is overseas talking to the Queen&mdash;that the majority of Australians somehow support his position on whether we should become a republic or not. He has not only offended those service men and women by trying to rewrite the history of their service in both the first and second world wars, but also he has offended them because he wants to change the traditions for which they fought and died.</PARA>

She goes through this magical transformation only when she comes to Australia or goes to Fiji, PNG or any other such places. I have never seen anyone have more changes&mdash;she has more changes than Danny La Rue. Basically she is the Queen of England. Her children are English citizens and her affiliations and affirmations are with the English. She was at the recent CHOGM conference as the Queen of England, not as the Queen of Australia.

I think that is a most regrettable thing for any member of this parliament to introduce into his comments in the debate in this chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill is all about: an attempt by the government to trivialise the oath of citizenship, to replace a solemn commitment made by new citizens with a flippant piece of new poetry. An oath of allegiance should be a public declaration of loyalty, a solemn commitment to their new nation. It should be a binding attestation of citizenship. Instead of a statement which encompasses those ideals, those promises for the future, we are now to have a trivial, pathetic piece of poetry. It is vague and uncertain. It says nothing of substance and fails to make the real commitment that we have the right to expect of those people who are becoming new Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two aspects of this new oath which I want to refer to tonight and to oppose: firstly, the removal in the new poem, the new pledge, of any reference to the Queen of Australia; and, secondly, the way in which this new poem further weakens the statement of commitment expected of Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, for some time Labor has been espousing a republican agenda. If people had any doubts that this particular change in the oath of citizenship is associated with the republican agenda of the Labor Party, they had only to listen to the speaker who has just concluded, the honourable member for Throsby. He made it quite clear that Labor is all about establishing a republican Australia, and this is one aspect of that particular activity. Already we have seen Labor moving to remove some of the trappings of our constitutional monarchy. Words like royal are not supposed to be used. References to the Crown are being replaced. Now any reference to the Queen of Australia in the oath or affirmation of citizenship is to be removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is doing this sort of thing as part of a pretend republic. It has never put the question of whether or not Australia wants to be a republic to the Australian people, who, after all, have the clear constitutional responsibility to make that decision. No matter how much the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) may detest the constitutional monarchy and no matter how much members of the Labor Party may wish that we were a republic, they cannot wake up one morning and suddenly decide that this country is no longer a constitutional monarchy. Only the people of Australia, by way of referendum, can make that decision. That may gall or upset honourable members opposite, but it is a clear fact of our constitutional democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have instead is a government that knows it cannot win a republic referendum&mdash;that knows that if it put the question to the Australian people it would lose, it would be defeated, it would be belted well and truly on the question&mdash;trying to introduce a republic by stealth. Bit by bit, it chips away at the trappings of our constitutional monarchy and tries to eliminate the traditions that have made our great country. This is one step in that agenda. The republican committee was a half a million dollar flop. It did not even produce a credible alternative. Of course, the Prime Minister will continue to raise this kind of an issue whenever he is in trouble, regardless of whether it is on unemployment, massive foreign debts, budgets that will not balance or just the table and chairs in the Lodge. The republic will be brought up every time the Prime Minister cannot think of anything else to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's offensive remarks have done nothing to raise the esteem of our country around the world. If he wants to change our constitution, let him do it by rational debate, by persuading the people of Australia that there ought to be something different from what we have today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in England at the time the decision was made that Sydney would host the Olympic Games. I was amazed to hear a television commentator on British television say in an interview that Australia was a totally unfit place to host the Olympic Games because Australians were too arrogant. I have heard Australians called lots of things by the British, particularly on the rugby league field, at the test match or the like, but I have never heard anyone around the world refer to Australians as arrogant. One man has single-handedly given us that reputation. The Prime Minister is about to go on one of his trips around the world and offend a few more of our friends. By his divisiveness, the Prime Minister has damaged our national reputation rather than do anything to build a constructive debate around the republican question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an old proverb `He who throws mud loses ground'. That is a lesson the Prime Minister could well learn. By throwing mud, by resorting to empty name calling, he is doing absolutely nothing towards improving Australians' understanding of our constitution and of the issues which surround whether we should be a constitutional monarchy or whether we should be a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through this legislation, Labor is clearly devaluing our oath or affirmation. I was personally appalled when the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the first law officer of the Crown, decided at his own swearing in that he had the right to make up whatever oath or affirmation he felt was appropriate. He did not follow the traditions; he just made up his own oath or affirmation. That I think set a very poor example for the man who is supposed to be the first law officer of the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This disgraceful arrogance has been typical of Labor in government. The constitution of our country is, of course, by no means quiet on what form the oath or affirmation should take. Section 42 of the constitution says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every senator and every member of the House of Representatives shall before taking his seat make and subscribe before the Governor-General, or some person authorised by him, an oath or affirmation of allegiance in the form set forth in the schedule to this Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA>There is only one schedule in the constitution, and that is the schedule which outlines the words of the oath or affirmation. Those words are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>then one says one's name&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Her heirs and successors according to law, SO HELP ME GOD!</PARA>
<PARA>The constitution of our country, through its schedule, defines the words of the oath or affirmation that the members of this parliament must make when taking their seat in this House. The fact that that affirmation and oath is included as a schedule to the constitution and not precisely attached to section 42 itself demonstrates that there was a clear intent on the part of our founding fathers that that should be the model oath or affirmation whenever an Australian citizen was called upon to make that oath. A clear precedent was established there, clear words outlined, as to what should be included when Australians were required to take an oath. With this particular change now before the House, we move a long way away from those formal words of commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I have some criticism of our current citizenship oath, it is that it is too weak. There are many areas where I think it could be strengthened, particularly the fact that it now fails to renounce any kind of previous citizenship. Our citizens are not called upon when they make their oath or affirmation to renounce any allegiances to other countries. This sort of thing has contributed to the dual citizenship problems that came to a head in the cases following the Wills by-election. If those candidates had renounced their former citizenship at the time they became citizens of Australia, the issue may well not have arisen as to whether they were eligible to sit in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No oaths of allegiance in other countries are anything like as pathetic or as weak as the one being proposed for Australia in this legislation. I will take as an example the oath that must be taken by someone becoming a United States citizen. The American oath of allegiance reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, to whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.</PARA>
<PARA>What a difference there is between that kind of commitment and the little piece of poetry we are going to ask potential Australian citizens to recite in the future. An American citizen even has to make a commitment to bear arms if required. By taking this oath, people are certainly making a commitment to fulfil their duties as citizens of the United States; they are making a commitment that they will contribute to their country. By contrast, what are we proposing? Our new citizens will recite this little poem:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From this time forward, under God,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose democratic beliefs I share,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose rights and liberties I respect, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose laws I will uphold and obey.</PARA>
<PARA>I will go through it bit by bit. `From this time forward, under God', means, in other words, not in the past but only from now on. What does `I pledge my loyalty to Australia' mean? There is no definition either in the legislation or in the Australian Citizenship Act which explains what is meant by this term. What does it mean to be loyal to Australia? Does it mean to cheer for Australia at the cricket or make sure that we wear green and gold at the right time? Is that the sort of loyalty that is expected of Australian citizens? Surely it is a lot more than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The poem talks about `loyalty to its people', but which people are they? Does it mean every Australian, including those who do bad as well as those who do good? What sorts of standards do we set for the loyalty that is expected of new Australian citizens?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Citizens then give an indication that they share the democratic beliefs of Australians. I wonder what they are. What is the definition of these `democratic beliefs'? They are not outlined in our constitution and they are not outlined in this legislation. Is it government by the people, for the people as defined by the Americans&mdash;a system which we see very little of in the Australian parliamentary democracy, particularly when the Prime Minister storms out of question time and denies matters of public importance and proper debate on issues? Is that the kind of democracy that future Australians are declaring their support for?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the democratic socialists of the former German Democratic Republic or the Soviet Union? They all ascribe to democracy. Is that the kind of description of democracy that we are talking about in this new piece of poetry? Certainly the Prime Minister's ideas of democracy&mdash;the sort we saw today in his petulant display&mdash;are not what I define as democracy or the kind of democracy that I am prepared to pledge my loyalty to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The poem then goes on to say `whose rights and liberties I respect'. No more is required of prospective Australian citizens than to respect those rights and liberties. There is no obligation to further or extend them; just an obligation to respect the fact that somebody else might happen to have a right or liberty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It then refers to the `laws I will uphold and obey'. That is the end&mdash;a mere promise to uphold and obey the laws. Surely citizenship is more than obeying rules, more than obeying the laws. We have to do more than take out an annual dog licence to be qualified to regard ourselves as loyal and faithful Australian citizens. Clearly, being an Australian citizen not only carries with it rights and privileges&mdash;we have heard previous speakers in this debate refer at great length to the rights and privileges of being an Australian citizen; those rights and privileges are indeed significant and we have a right to be proud of them&mdash;but also carries with it obligations and responsibilities. Nowhere in this new, trite piece of poetry is there any commitment on the part of new citizens to contribute towards their country, to add to our society, to add to our traditions, to do more than merely uphold the laws, to help their fellow Australians and to do something about making this country an even greater place through their presence as Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I came into this place I served as a council chairman. In that capacity, I had the privilege of conducting many citizenship ceremonies. They were, as much as I could make them, prestigious occasions. As often as possible, I had the full council in attendance. These ceremonies were conducted before the flag and we saw our citizens take a solemn oath or affirmation, usually before relatives or friends, and photos were taken by newspaper photographers and others to record the occasions so that they would be memorable for the new citizens. They were, after all, making a new beginning as Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many councils follow the practice of giving the new Australian citizens a tree to help symbolise the growth of their own citizenship in this country. New citizens plant a tree to symbolise their own beginnings in this country. In all of these sorts of ways, local government&mdash;the level at which citizenship ceremonies are actually undertaken&mdash;is doing what it can to make the occasion a dignified, solemn and memorable event for all of those new Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a passing point, I express regret that the government, in introducing this new pledge, did not bother to consult with local government and the people who will be undertaking the citizenship ceremonies; just as it did not consult local government a few years ago when it replaced the grand citizenship certificate with a cheap duplicated certificate. This certificate was condemned by those conducting the ceremonies and was eventually replaced by a certificate which reflected more accurately and appropriately the importance of Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian citizenship should be a prized privilege. We should regard these citizenship ceremonies as important occasions when a new citizen not only accepts the privileges of living in Australia but also solemnly undertakes to fulfil the responsibilities of being an Australian citizen. New citizens should accept the commitment to fulfil their duties as citizens, to contribute positively and add to our national heritage, and pledge to be loyal to our country through good times and bad&mdash;to be loyal to Australia when there are droughts and floods, and when the government is good or when the government is bad, like it is at the present time. Citizenship is not selective. People take with it the freedoms and privileges of being an Australian, and also the obligations and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot say when we become citizens that we are part of this bit of Australia, but not that bit. We take the entire constitution, including the constitutional monarchy. If we are not prepared to make a commitment to the system that we have at the present time we should not become Australian citizens. If we want to make changes, once we are Australian citizens we have the right to vote in referendums to bring about those changes. But by becoming citizens we are accepting and becoming a part of the system that applies in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was born an Australian and I am proud of my citizenship. I do not have a British heritage. I did not have to decide to make this my home; the privileges of citizenship came to me automatically. But I recognise that, in having this prized privilege of Australian citizenship, I also have responsibilities and obligations to my fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that new Australian citizens are made aware at their citizenship ceremonies of the responsibilities of Australian citizenship as much as they are made aware of the privileges. Their new beginning in a new country should be a solemn occasion at which they make a commitment to their country and a commitment to contribute to their country. A pathetic piece of poetry is no substitute for a solemn statement of loyalty to their new country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very grateful, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you have called me and I have an opportunity to participate in this debate on the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill. I thank the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) for his contribution. I recall his predecessor, Clarrie Millar, who I think was one of the most esteemed members of this House. He was respected by both sides. In fact, because of the respect in which he was held by members of this House, he was very difficult to debate against. He is someone whom I remember with a great deal of affection and I look forward to seeing him from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the honourable member for Wide Bay has a little way to go before he reaches that status. There is much in what he has contributed to which I would want to take exception. Let us go to the heart or to the thrust of what he was saying about the pledge, which he described as a poem. First, I would like to read the old oath of allegiance. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I . . . swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen.</PARA>
<PARA>I apologise to the House because I cannot tell honourable members whether or not the previous oath of allegiance is a poem or poetic, so I will not make that accusation about it. But I contrast it with the new pledge, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From this time forward, under God,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose democratic beliefs I share,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose rights and liberties I respect, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose laws I will uphold and obey.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the criticisms that was raised is: why are we not getting our citizens to pledge their previous conduct rather than their present and future conduct? If this is a fair point, where is that in the oath of allegiance that is being held up as being so much better? The honourable member for Wide Bay also asked: what democratic beliefs? Indeed, in the previous oath of allegiance, where is the mention of democracy, of democratic beliefs? It is not there. There is no problem with it, but it is not there. The honourable member asked: what people? Funnily enough, the Australian people are not mentioned at all in the old oath of allegiance. If this is what the honourable member for Wide Bay is taking exception to in the new form of pledge&mdash;the new oath&mdash;why does he not take equal exception to it under the old oath of allegiance? Herein I think honourable members will find the hypocrisy perhaps that some members opposite have brought to the debate about changing the pledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having attended a number of citizenship ceremonies&mdash;for example I know that the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), with his constituency, would attend even more than I&mdash;this new pledge makes a lot of sense to new Australians wanting to become Australian citizens. They find it very difficult, usually having travelled thousands of kilometres after making a very brave decision to establish a new home and a new life in Australia&mdash;that decision, by the way, flatters and honours us&mdash;to then pledge allegiance to a queen who does not sit in Australia but is located thousands of kilometres away from us. So this form of allegiance makes a lot more sense to them. They can understand what it is all about. We do not have to go through the rigmarole of trying to explain what our constitutional monarchy is all about. As I say, it is very relevant. In fact, a small minority of either permanent residents or new citizens actually object to making the oath of allegiance or affirmation of allegiance because of their lack of meaning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are being told, particularly by the shadow minister for social security, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), that this is the thin end of the wedge argument, that getting a meaningful pledge of commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia is the thin end of the wedge and that by tomorrow, by stealth, we will probably change it and thereby introduce a republic. What nonsense. What absolute and arrant nonsense. It is appropriate that Australia, in looking to observe 100 years of federation, review what is the best constitutional framework for this country. It is made even more relevant by the call of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to Australia to at least come to grips with where it is in the world, both geographically and in terms of its future; that is, without denying any of our heritage, our future rests in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trying to explain to Asians that the Queen of England is actually the Queen of Australia, I think poses some difficulty. Indeed, when the Governor-General travels overseas as the vice-regal representative, having to insist that he is our effective head of state is sometimes embarrassing. For all those who want to cling to this old form, could they please tell me when the monarch of England led a trade mission to the United States? When did the monarch of England extol the virtues of Australian industry in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand or Malaysia? Of course, she has never done that, nor is she expected to do it because her prime responsibility is with England. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Come on. The honourable member knows that she is a very powerful representative of English industry and is used on quite a number of occasions to sell not only ordinary industry but, indeed, the armaments of England. I have witnessed her visits to Middle Eastern countries which have been quickly followed by the signing of significant military contracts. I do not object to that. I do not object to it one iota. But it is very foolish for people to suggest that the Queen is able to discharge, and is capable of fully discharging, her role as Queen of Australia in all its facets in the way in which we would normally understand a head of state might fulfil the role or indeed the role she fulfils for England.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While on the subject, I think the Queen of England is a much admired person right throughout Australia. I do not think I could make the same statement about her heirs and successors. I think there is a lot of speculation that, if Australia waits for the year 2001 to become a republic, the British might beat us to the act, should the Queen abdicate. I do not want to detract from that. I admire the Queen of England, but I say to new Australians who have come from all parts of the globe to settle in this country that there is nothing disloyal, nothing unpatriotic and nothing treasonable about asking them to take this pledge, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From this time forward, under God,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose democratic beliefs I share,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose rights and liberties I respect, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose laws I will uphold and obey.</PARA>
<PARA>None of those qualities is in this pledge. This is far more meaningful. In fact, if we were to sample new citizens who have taken the oath under the old oath of affirmation and under this one, I know what the result would be. Overwhelmingly, they would have a better understanding of the important act that they are performing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to put on record that probably new Australians take their citizenship far more seriously than Australian born people who have citizenship conferred on them automatically. If we want to look at uplifting the importance of citizenship, I say to honourable members opposite: do not single out new Australians only. I think there is much that we could do in our country to get a greater understanding of the responsibilities and benefits of being a citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wide Bay talked about the role of local government. I have to be honest and say that an involvement in local government is another thing that the honourable member for Fowler and I share, as you do too, Mr Deputy Speaker. The federal government delegates to local government the conduct of citizenship ceremonies. I know that in my area&mdash;I am sure the same goes for other areas&mdash;local government takes that conduct very responsibly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wide Bay mentioned the giving of a very small tree at the citizenship ceremony, which is a practice in my part of the world. However, bibles signed by the mayor are also given. If I had my druthers&mdash;I am not suggesting we do not have the most practical and effective arrangement of these matters&mdash;I would dearly love it if it were the responsibility of a federal member to confer citizenship because it is certainly a very moving ceremony; it is something that whole families gather to witness and a day that they treasure for life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very simple bill to amend Australian citizenship. It replaces an oath of allegiance to the Queen, her heirs and successors with a much more practical, easily understood pledge&mdash;something that I was pleased to support through my local government. However, it was argued with some merit at a meeting of the North Mount Druitt branch of the Labor Party that we ought to review the way migrants are treated with regard to the length of time it takes to become a citizen. For example, it was argued that a transitional arrangement should apply when migrants first arrive here, whereby a much greater period elapses before full citizenship is conferred. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That branch meeting suggested four to five years. The reason is that there is always a very small minority of migrants who unfortunately either bring with them or develop while in Australia practices which lead them into strife with the law. Of course, once they are made citizens they cannot be deported. It is for that purpose that it was suggested there should be a review of the length of time before full citizenship is conferred. For example, if two years has to elapse beforehand then there is a greater ability to deport those who break the law. I want to emphasise that I am talking about an infinitesimally small minority of new Australian citizens. The suggestion is worthy of consideration at least. I certainly have some sympathy with the views expressed by that branch meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is this bill about? It does not introduce a republic, lead to a republic by stealth, undermine the monarchy, nor is it treasonable or unpatriotic. It is a simple bill that at its core tries to make relevant the pledge that people take when they want to become Australian citizens. The bill has been described as a poem. Given your expertise in literature, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be better able to adjudicate its poetic merits and that of the former oath of allegiance. I apologise to the House because I am not skilled in this area and feel unqualified to comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do feel very qualified to comment about the impact this pledge is having&mdash;how it makes the whole act of becoming a citizen far more relevant. In fact, it allows some of those who are not Australian citizens but who have been here for years to now step forward and become Australian citizens. Those honourable members who have large numbers of migrants in their electorates and who participate in citizenship ceremonies know from their own experience that this bill is right, that the changes are right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Sunday I was in my office replying to a letter on the republican issue. There is a belief that somehow Australia can become a republic without a referendum. It is the sort of line that is implied often in contributions either in this House or outside by opposition members. I repeat, as I did in my reply to my constituent, that a referendum is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is some time since we had a referendum but I remind the House that, for a referendum to be passed, it requires the support of a majority of the states, as well as a majority of the Australian people. It is a very tough test that very few referendums have survived. The centenary of federation in the year 2001 is approaching, so it is entirely appropriate, as the Prime Minister said, that there be a wide ranging public debate. We have only just started that debate and not, as the shadow minister wants, dipsticked and held a referendum today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope to see a very wide ranging debate. I say to the shadow minister that, when he mixes with young Australians and sees their understanding of our democracy and our system of government, he will realise that these people will not be stampeded by scare tactics, which seem to be the principal methodology of the opposition. These young people will not be fooled and hoodwinked. The constitutional structure of this country will be critical for that generation and succeeding generations. It will not be critical for me or for the honourable member for Fowler or the shadow minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is very strongly supported by this side of the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a sad little debate we are having here today on the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill. It takes my mind back to an occasion less than 10 years ago when the Hawke government rewrote the Australian Citizenship Act and we debated a bill on the total rewriting of the previous act. I would like to contrast that occasion with the occasion here tonight because it is very illuminating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984, as a result of wide community consultations initiated by then Minister for Immigration Macphee, under the Fraser government, there was a rewriting of the Citizenship Act. There was agreement that there was a need for an updating. Those community consultations which took place in public forums throughout Australia culminated in the rewriting of the Citizenship Act, which we debated in 1984. That Australian Citizenship Bill 1984 also included a different oath and affirmation of allegiance from the one that Australian citizens had been taking to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That new oath and affirmation was rejected for one simple reason: in the process of those consultations, there was no emerging demand for a new oath or affirmation of allegiance. I notice that the last time that Australian public opinion was tested&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Mrs SULLIVAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence might listen to what I said. Those community consultations did not show an emerging demand for a change in the oath or affirmation of allegiance. That is not to say there were not some individuals who had that view. That view was considered but it was not accepted. It was not a general request. There were some individuals&mdash;I will instance Franca Arena&mdash;who said it, but it was not a community view. Whatever the honourable member wants to say about that now, the point is that this new pledge of allegiance is not something that has come from the community. It may well be that there is a view out there in support of it, but I do not know that and the government does not know that because it has not tested it; it has not consulted this time. Very differently, this proposal has flowed from the government's own rhetoric as its leader seeks to move us towards a republic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no strong desire to change the oath and affirmation of allegiance back in the early 1980s. There has been no testing of whether there is any such strong desire in the 1990s. If the government were fair dinkum, it would test it, it would hold those consultations. It would allow the members of the Mount Druitt branch of the Labor Party to put a submission to the government and, if need be, go to some public consultations and express their views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very indebted to the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) for having stated the views of the Mount Druitt branch of the Labor Party here tonight on the subject of how long people should be resident before they take citizenship. He said that these Labor Party people are of the view that the time of residence should be increased from two years to maybe three or four. For the record, it was the Citizenship Act 1984 which reduced it from four years to two years. Community consultations were brought to bear and the Hawke government decided that that was the way it was going to proceed. It was the Hawke government that changed it from four years to two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mount Druitt branch members of the Labor Party might be interested to read the opposition's immigration policy. They might be surprised to see how much of it they agree with, particularly in terms of length of residence. This was a policy for which the Labor Party bagged and condemned us prior to the last election. The honourable member for Chifley might need to read the policy himself for the next time he goes to a branch meeting to get his propaganda straight&mdash;certainly to get his lines straight. I know that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) would be delighted to provide him or the members of the Mount Druitt branch of the Labor Party with a copy of the policy. If the honourable member for Chifley would just give him the mailing list&mdash;that would save him some trouble&mdash;the honourable member for Berowra will send out the policy to them himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the issue of the way in which we are moving. In 1984, I remind the House, the Australian Democrats voted against the change to the oath of allegiance. They voted against it on the ground that I have given: that there was not a demonstrated community demand for any such change. In fact, there was quite some resistance to any suggestion for change. This time the pale echo of the party that these modern Democrats are, compared with the Chippocrats as they used to be called, have wet their finger, put it in the air, think they know which way the wind is blowing and they have gone along with it. They want to strike the right pose. It might be the pose that the people who voted for them now want them to strike. That is a very different attitude for them, and certainly not one of principle as was followed in 1984 by all members of the then Australian Democrats in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should make no mistake about the origins of this change. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), some months ago&mdash;I think it was at the end of last year&mdash;declared that he had changed the oath or affirmation of allegiance. As I am sure that you did, Mr Deputy Speaker, I received a number of letters and telephone calls of upset and distress from constituents saying how terrible it was that he could have done this. I was obliged to respond to them and say, `Well, almighty and powerful as he might think he is, he cannot do this. It requires the amendment of an act of parliament'. Finally, this amendment is before us. The Prime Minister very clearly is the prime mover. Until he made that statement, none of us had any idea that it was in the wind.

This is the party that talks about having referendums and polling its members on everything. This time, they did not think it necessary to have any community consultations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the context of the debate about a republic, which has been referred to this evening, not least by the honourable member for Chifley, surely it is basic that if we are to change fundamentally our style of government, if we are to change fundamentally something about Australia&mdash;and the oath or affirmation of allegiance is just that: the fundamental statement by which people become Australian citizens if they have not been born to it&mdash;then that is something that should not be divisive.

It is not because of views on Mabo or the republic, it is because the government does not have any views on the things that matter to the people out there. The government uses Mabo&mdash;and the slanging that comes with it&mdash;and the republic&mdash;and the slanging that comes with it&mdash;as excuses for its abdication of leadership on what really matters in this country, and that is people's basic existence.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is about the sum of the republican debate in this country. If there were a genuine feeling that there is a large body of opinion out there that wants this country to be a republic, then the government would give a framework for a proper debate, consultation and the emergence of consensus.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the opposition would mind a preamble to the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill or an examination of the oath or affirmation of allegiance. However, we mind that this is done by way of grandstanding by this Prime Minister when he announced it nearly 12 months ago in a pro-republican, anti-monarchy context. That is the context in which he put it, so nobody should be surprised if that is what is debated. But what a shame that that is what it is. That is a devaluing of anything that we might say about citizenship, which is so fundamental to this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying, the tactic is something that obviously the Prime Minister has learnt in his travels in Asia&mdash;which have not been as extensive as he would want us to believe, or think&mdash;the diversion of the `foreign devil'. The honourable member for Chifley said that it is an expression of our coming to grips with where we are in the world. He then rabbited on about Asia. There is no dispute here about our role or our relationship with Asia&mdash;that is something the opposition has been behind long since. Nevertheless, I think the debate is not coming to grips with what we really require in national leadership. Never before have we had a debate so divisive on something which is so basic to our nation. That is why I said at the beginning that this is a sad debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To me, when we debate citizenship, it should be a matter of enthusiasm and an outpouring of views, not this pathetic apology for a debate. Like the honourable member for Chifley and many other members, I too have attended many citizenship ceremonies. I was earlier trying to remember just how many that might be in my now nearly 20 years in parliament. I live in a rapidly growing part of Australia and, since I have been a member of this parliament, it has been the most rapidly growing part of Australia. There are many citizenship ceremonies. If I were not in Canberra for an amount of the time, I would be attending up to six ceremonies a month in my electorate. In my time in parliament I have certainly attended more than 100 ceremonies, and I have seen tens of thousands of people take citizenship. They are a joyous occasion and a cause for celebration. Whenever I have the opportunity to participate, I do. I give them first priority over all my activities as a member of parliament, provided I am not in Canberra. I do not think there is anything more fundamental or more important than to be at citizenship ceremonies and to participate in them as a federal member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not go as far as the honourable member for Chifley in saying that we ought to be the ones who conduct the ceremonies. For a variety of reasons, including practicality, I think it works quite well when local authorities do it. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that in rural electorates it would not be practical for the member himself or herself to be doing it. Nevertheless, it is an important occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to tell honourable members a little anecdote, as others have&mdash;whether about a meeting of the Mount Druitt branch of the Labor Party or whatever. At one of those citizenship ceremonies for which local authorities are responsible within my electorate, the mayor&mdash;as they are all now known in Queensland&mdash;gets up and makes a pretty strong speech on the subject of the Australian flag. He never has to pause for applause; it comes spontaneously and strongly. There is a greater attachment amongst new citizens to what are traditional Australian things than some government members realise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years ago one of the leaders of one of the major ethnic groups in the Queensland community said to me that we needed to realise that people do not migrate to Australia because they want to change the rules; they come here because they want to enjoy the rules. They come to live under the rules that are already in place. It is a mistake to say that migrants are rushing in this direction. Many migrants of non-English background will not support the republic and the government's rush to it. I point out to the parliamentary secretary who interjected on me a couple of minutes ago that the flag is very much part of this debate because the Prime Minister has said that, if we change to a republic, then naturally the flag will change. Of course it will&mdash;even though government members are trying to keep that issue out of the centre of the debate. If we change something as fundamental as our nation, then we would change our most fundamental national symbol, namely, our flag. That is not an issue which can be played down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with everyone else, I will accept the umpire's verdict. But to me the umpire is the Australian people. It is not just a matter of having a referendum, as the honourable member for Chifley so rightly pointed out. It is a matter of the proper process prior to that referendum&mdash;if there is one&mdash;a proper process of determining whether there should be a referendum, and a proper debate on all the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks on the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill by reiterating the view that I have already put: I think it is proper that we try to find ways of codifying the meaning of citizenship. I personally have no objection to some sort of preamble to the Citizenship Act. My objection essentially is to the fact that it has been used as an arm of propaganda in a republican debate which I believe, along with many members of the Australian public, is nothing more than the enhancement of the vainglory of one person who seeks to see his name in the history books as the architect of the Australian republic. There are those who hold the view, `Good on him'. There are those who deplore it. The divisive way in which it has been pursued is not something that any of us, by any measure, could say is good for this country. </PARA>

It is my pleasure to speak in support of the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill. It is a very important piece of legislation, despite what the opposition might think. I will start by quoting from the second reading speech because it is so important:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a parliamentary democracy committed to providing equality before the law, freedom of the individual, freedom of speech and religion, equality between men and women and equality of opportunity for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is one of those few countries which actually relish its diversity. Under the umbrella of an overall commitment to the nation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is Australia, of course&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and its uniting values and institutions, a society of great richness and variety as well as remarkable harmony has evolved . . . As the multicultural society that we are, it is proper that the pledge of commitment be one that will be equally meaningful to all of our people. It is therefore time that individual citizens be allowed to make a commitment of loyalty to Australia in embracing Australia's democratic beliefs and institutions, respecting others' rights and liberties, and upholding and obeying the laws of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill is about Australia's identity. The opposition carries on with its arcane beliefs about the monarchy and preserving all that has gone on in the past. In the short time that I have been in this place, the opposition has proved beyond doubt that it does not have any policies of its own. All the opposition stands for is the past. It stands for all the negative values one could possibly think of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go over some of my experiences in relation to this issue. For six years it was my privilege to be an alderman on the Campbelltown City Council. In that time I attended many citizenship ceremonies. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Moncrieff mention that she had attended such ceremonies as well. Campbelltown is a fast growing area in south-west Sydney where there are a lot of people of non-English speaking backgrounds. On the most recent occasion when I attended a citizenship ceremony at Campbelltown it was in my new role as the federal member for Macarthur. I share the area covered by the Campbelltown City Council with the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin). It is an area of rapid growth, and an area where many new Australians seek citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been a privilege to attend those ceremonies and to see the excitement of the new citizens when they become naturalised or, I suppose, become legal Australians. But there is an element of confusion in the current situation. People come along and take the oath or the affirmation. Many of these people come from places like Chile, Argentina, Africa, South-East Asia and various parts of Europe. These people are forced to take an oath or an affirmation swearing allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. They come to Australia to live, but they are forced to take an oath or an affirmation to a monarch who does not even live here&mdash;a monarch of a foreign country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only confusing but, to me, embarrassing. As an alderman of Campbelltown City Council, and more recently as a federal member, it is embarrassing to me to see these hundreds of people taking out citizenship and having to take an oath or an affirmation to Queen Elizabeth II, who does not even live in Australia. It is obviously very hard for people to understand and comprehend, and that is hardly surprising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a multicultural society. I know there are people on the other side of the House who do not like that very much. At election times, to suit their political opportunism, they go out and campaign against multiculturalism. The fact is that we are a multicultural society, and I am proud of that. This bill recognises that situation, and it is long overdue in righting the tardiness of the past. There were attempts in 1973 and 1983 to get similar legislation through this parliament. It is better late than never. Hopefully, on this occasion the legislation will pass and new citizens to Australia will be able to take citizenship without having to swear an oath or make an affirmation to a foreign monarch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first four years that I was with Campbelltown City Council the most divisive issue concerned non-English speaking groups which made applications for the establishment of places of worship within the city area. The local Muslim group, the Suburban Islamic Society, tried to get a development application approved for a mosque. A Hindu group tried to get an application approved for a Hindu temple. The Labor caucus, of which I was a member, naturally supported the applications for two reasons. Firstly, we believe in equality and that people of any background are entitled to their place of worship regardless of race, colour or creed. Secondly&mdash;and even more importantly at the time&mdash;both applications that came before the council were perfectly within any planning codes or zonings that existed within New South Wales and particularly within the Campbelltown City Council area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Liberal Party saw an opportunity to score political points, and it doorknocked and ran stories in the local paper attacking these applications.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition talks about the republic as if it were some sort of one-man crusade, as if somehow the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has a personal obsession with the republic, and it is only the Prime Minister who is interested in making Australia an independent nation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House has seen some Stalinist rewrites of history. The Australian community has never really appreciated that this building is unique in the world's history. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Encyclopaedia</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was a voyage of architecture and engineering discovery in which new oceans were chartered, new frontiers of knowledge and technology were conquered and the resources of science and technology were employed to solve design, erection and quality problems beyond the capacity of conventional methods.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact that it happened in Sydney was the result of a series of accidents&mdash;and in spite of the efforts of a majority of the New South Wales architectural profession, the arts community and the coalition politicians of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people contributed to its success, but without three men&mdash;none of whom was Australian&mdash;it would have just been another building. Those three men were Eugene Goossens, who gave impetus to the idea of a music and opera centre and the Bennelong Point site; Joern Utzon, who gave Sydney and the world an architectural masterpiece and brought a combination of vision and technical competence unmatched in the history of architecture; and Eero Saarinen, the Finnish-American architect who selected the design. The first two men were hounded from the country in disgrace. Saarinen was here for only four days; not long enough to get any abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the time Utzon won the competition in 1957 until he was expelled from the country in 1966, he was subject to an endless stream of character assassination&mdash;a victim of partisan politics, professional jealousy and stupidity. On the very day he was expelled, a Melbourne non-entity was awarded the gold medal for architecture. The small-mindedness of those in the arts community was sickening as they fought to carve up the building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The display of Utzon's winning design, at the New South Wales art gallery with the other 233 entries in the international competition, brought forth howls of outrage from a combination of disgruntled competitors and philistines enraged not only by the potential expenditure for a music and opera centre but also by the concept itself. It was largely beyond the aesthetic horizons of the Australian community and, therefore, a personal affront to many people. It recognised that the building was more important as a symbol and a piece of sculpture than anything which would happen inside it&mdash;again a personal affront to many who saw it only as an opportunity to expand their personal empires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sydney Opera House was a reinvention of the wheel in terms of aesthetics and construction. The reinforced concrete used was light-years away from normal industry standards, as was the use of materials such as stainless steel and phosphor-bronze. Utzon brought a level of technical expertise to match the genius of the concept, which was bewildering to the architectural profession. The building returned to the mundane after he left, but fortunately most permanent parts of the structure had been committed. These standards of quality and the need to reinvent the design and construction techniques fed his critics and fuelled the partisan political appetite of the state opposition, which had been out of office for over two decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the fall of the Labor government in 1965, Utzon's critics found their gunman in the new minister for public works&mdash;a belligerent Country Party politician who justified years of partisan attack by firing Utzon and who remains a haunted figure to this day, desperately trying to justify his actions. Sydney's architectural profession, to their eternal shame, would not support Utzon. Some were motivated by professional jealousy and some were motivated by the venal consideration that the minister was the largest client in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The magnificent relationship of the Opera House, the  bridge and the CBD on the site of Australia's first European settlement forms an unparalleled urban gateway. Yet that relationship was a result of a series of unplanned historical accidents, as was the availability of the Bennelong site made possible by the destruction of Sydney's tram system. The ridiculous $7 million original estimate, the crazy decision to proceed with the construction prior to the completion of the design of the superstructure and the creation of the Opera House lottery made the building possible. It is an unbelievable irony that this collection of accidents, incompetence and malevolence could produce such an inspiring triumph in a largely ocker, `she'll be right' society at the end of the world. It is right that someone of Utzon's integrity should never return to this country. But Sydney, at some point, needs an act of atonement and recognition to him. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I was in Perth a few other interesting things happened. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has been attacking me on Perth commercial radio and misquoting what I said in this parliament on 22 October. He did not mention my name, which probably was very wise as he was misquoting what I said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, I said that I believed that with the way members of the Western Australian government were carrying on, one would be forgiven for thinking that they saw themselves as the last bastion of white supremacy. I did not say they were white supremacists. But never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that events could unfold as they have in the last three weeks, which could make the comments I made in an adjournment debate ring so true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had not been in Perth for very long last week when I heard on the news and saw in the local paper some statements made by a Liberal member of the Western Australian upper house, Mr Ross Lightfoot, MLC. He said that Aborigines were never civilised and that in their primitive state today they are the bottom colour of the civilisation spectrum. How much more white supremacist could he possibly get? This issue was raised in the Legislative Assembly of the Western Australian state parliament last Thursday. The Leader of the Opposition, Carmen Lawrence, moved a very strong censure motion against those comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs tried his utmost&mdash;I give him eight out of 10 for trying&mdash;to distance himself from those comments. But the next day the same Mr Lightfoot, outside parliament, said that it was a lie to suggest that none of his colleagues agreed with his remarks that Aborigines were not civilised in their native state and were the bottom colour of the civilisation spectrum. Mr Lightfoot was insistent that most of his state government colleagues agreed with his comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can add that to the recent statements of former Prime Minister John Gorton, who said unequivocally that Aboriginal people were inferior&mdash;a cut and dried statement, with not much equivocation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to direct my comments to the current Industry Commission inquiry into the petroleum industry across Australia. I would like to join with the Deputy Premier of New South Wales and the Minister for Consumer Affairs for New South Wales in calling on the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to do everything in his power to expedite the Industry Commission inquiry into the petroleum industry. I know it is looking at releasing a draft report early next year, but the situation across New South Wales has become quite serious&mdash;as honourable members would no doubt be aware&mdash;with the variation in the price of fuel. It certainly reflects not only the cost of transport of fuel to the different areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent press report outlined a summation of petrol prices across New South Wales. Prices varied greatly from 67.9c per litre in suburban Sydney to 78.9c a litre in Dubbo, 81.9c a litre in Broken Hill and 74.9c a litre in Port Macquarie. The brief for the Industry Commission inquiry is to look not only at the cost of production and transport but also at the management of the process as well as the wholesale and retail distribution networks in the petroleum industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly not before time that this takes place. The Prices Surveillance Authority plays a very important role in petrol pricing around Australia. That body is set up by government to recommend a wholesale price. At the moment, that wholesale price is supposed to be just over 71c per litre. It strikes me as a little strange to see prices down in the low 60s, if that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the prerogative of the oil companies, when trying to capture greater market share, to put on a price war. But it always seems to be to the advantage of people in metropolitan areas&mdash;I suppose purely because that is where the numbers are when they are trying to grab that market share. People living in country areas and regional and provincial cities do not seem to receive the benefit of these price wars. Nor does the price of fuel in those areas reflect the true cost of freight, which is supposed to be the only differential. I know the Service Station Association New South Wales, in its submission to the Industry Commission inquiry, has urged the commission to make recommendations for there to be a terminal gate price for fuel so that everybody is paying the same price for fuel with the freight component&mdash;only a matter of fractions of cents per litre&mdash;being the only variable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prices Surveillance Authority, in its role in the petroleum industry, is not doing a responsible or fair dinkum job. Over the last 12 months we have seen great fluctuations in the world price of crude oil. That has supposedly been reflected in recommendations to the petroleum industry as far as wholesale prices are concerned. No recommendations have come from the Prices Surveillance Authority that the wholesale price of fuel be reduced. It has always been increased over that time. It may be timely, within the Industry Commission inquiry, to look also at the operation of the Prices Surveillance Authority, as a body set up by the federal government to monitor monopolistic, or partly monopolistic, enterprises; of which the petroleum industry is one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key area of my concern in the price of fuel is that it affects everything we do in regional Australia. This government, the New South Wales government and the federal opposition have placed a great deal of emphasis on regional development across Australia. If we are serious about that we need to address the disparity in the price of fuel and the cost of transport, and the disparity of operating a business and employing people in regional Australia in comparison with metropolitan areas. If the Industry Commission inquiry takes that into account, we might have some reasonable explanations. In closing, I urge the Treasurer to hurry that up.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thank you for letting me air my feelings.</PARA>
<PARA>That is typical of the sort of letter I receive. Another one, from DEAL Communication Centre, points out the human side of what is happening in Victoria now that it has been taken over by a Liberal government and now that Mr Kennett's policies are starting to affect average people. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Chynoweth</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEAL Communication Centre was founded in 1986 with support from Federal and State governments to provide services for people with severe communication impairment. The bulk of its funding (80%) came from the Commonwealth. In the years </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">since it has provided services to over one thousand Victorians, has pioneered therapy methods that have been adopted all over the world, and has helped to change the lives of hundreds of people who are eligible for communication therapy services from no other source. Jeff Kennett has now appropriated its funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Commonwealth/State Disability Agreement responsibility for DEAL's funding ceased being a joint federal/state matter and was transferred entirely to the state sphere in 1992/3. The terms of the agreement prohibited the state terminating funding in the first year. Immediately this protection expired at the end of June, 1993, the Minister, Michael John, stopped all funding.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: all funding. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The particular excuses given were that there were unspecified concerns about DEAL's operations and that DEAL had failed in an unspecified manner to meet the requirements of a recent administrative review; however, as many of the other services that were transferred to State funding at the same time as DEAL also had their funding terminated at about the same time it is rather more likely that the government simply wanted the money and didn't particularly care where it came from.</PARA>
<PARA>This is referring to people with 80 per cent disability. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government isn't putting the money into other surviving State services for people with disabilities, either&mdash;they've all been cut too. The Minister has stated that DEAL's funding will be transferred to a new agency, but no steps have been taken to establish any such agency and the evidence is that the government has no real intention of doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEAL is the only agency in Victoria that provides ongoing communication therapy to all people with severe communication impairment regardless of age or diagnosis, and if DEAL were to close a high proportion of its clients would be unable to find any service at all that would accept them as clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are talking about people communicating via computer with a pointer on their head. This is the sort of funding that Jeffrey Kennett's Liberal government has cut. This is the sort of story that is affecting many people throughout Victoria. These are the little things that we do not hear about. We hear about the big picture, about KNF Advertising and all those sorts of things, but these are real lives, real people being affected by what is happening in Victoria. The sooner the Liberal government goes the better, and all I can say is that I will work my butt off to make certain that it does go.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It is cleaner and I can take off my mask. I look around and I see that there are lots of advertisement boards around. They are advertising 1993 Toyota Tarago's. I think back. I was eleven at the time. If only we had done something then. If we had resisted the pollution. I remembered all the trees around me. Now in 2012 I see giant black clouds shadowing me from the sun.

There's nothing I can do. His dog food had been contaminated at the dog food factory. With all the pollution. I'm not surprised, the pollution is so bad I won't leave home. It's like I'm stuck in a prison. . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My comments tonight refer to the performance and behaviour of Transfield Shipbuilding. They cover four or five different aspects. I refer to a hearing of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology of this parliament in Melbourne on 19 July. I asked Dr White from Transfield Shipbuilding to update the committee on a report which had been issued back in 1989 regarding the distribution of work by the then Amecon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anzac ship project&mdash;AMECON tender spread of work by electorate</EMPHASIS> covers a number of pages which go into the methodology of the details, then specifies the distribution of the project Australia wide, electorate by electorate, state by state and also takes into account the New Zealand content. It also goes into some details about the nature of the electorates themselves. I have subsequently received a document which is an update of that original one and there are a couple of points to make about that. The first qualification made is that the contract was for 10 ships, not 12, as was originally tendered for. Hence it obviously required some modification. That in itself is understandable. What is not understandable is Dr White's comments made subsequent to the government announcement of 10 ships regarding work distribution where he said he stood by the spread that Amecon had actually made public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of the qualification it makes is that, because of the change of electorates, it cannot provide electorate by electorate breakdowns. But it is interesting to note that in its state by state breakdowns, firstly taking the Newcastle situation, the reduction from $560 million in its original report to $100 million as a current estimate is obviously quite substantial&mdash;a ratio of almost 1:6. Mind you, it is not so different from Western Australia, where the spread was reduced from $90 million to $15 million, and perhaps even worse than Tasmania, where it was reduced from $25 million to $5 million. The interesting thing about all that, of course, is that one of the major winners was the ACT, which has gone up from $54 million to $266 million, a fivefold increase. I think it would be of interest to honourable members to know how we could actually transfer work from industrial centres such as Newcastle and Western Australia into the ACT. I guess we will leave it for another day to find out why the ACT is suddenly a substantial contributor. In fact, almost 10 per cent&mdash;a total of $266 million&mdash;of the total $3 billion that has been let is going into the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next aspect is the question of the industrial relations situation. As members would understand now, Transfield has established in New Zealand a shipyard effectively to build modules for the Anzac frigates. However, it has the advantage in New Zealand of the New Zealand industrial relations contract, which is a personal contract between the employer and the employee. I asked Dr White whether he would make a copy available. He declined to do so on the grounds of commercial advantage, and I can understand that. I think there probably is a commercial advantage, and what is likely to happen in the months ahead is that the Amecon subsidiary in New Zealand will be used to squeeze the prices and the wages of Transfield employees throughout Australia. Another aspect of its contractual obligations is that the MTIA insists that the government debrief all unsuccessful bidders and tenders. There is not the same requirement for Transfield, which makes no attempt to debrief any unsuccessful tenderer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the Newcastle Trades Hall Council made a statement regarding its concerns about Transfield, and I share those concerns. It is a situation now where most major industries in the engineering field in Australia find Transfield a company which is difficult to deal with and which is somewhat suspect in terms of what it says and does. The figures I have indicated tonight certainly amplify and substantiate that. The danger that this government is condoning the behaviour and performance of companies by issuing them with contracts when those companies have no intention in some cases or pay lip-service&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was talking to a friend who is married with three children and currently unemployed. He had worked continuously for 12 years as a Nursery Hand &amp; Landscape Labourer. He was known to be a good worker with strong work ethics. He has now been unemployed for 4 months and states he "has never had it so good, and they'd have to offer me a pretty good job to make it worth my while to return to work". </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a comparison, I am married with no children, work long hours in a high stress job for a net income of $712.60 per fortnight ($250 of which goes to loan repayments).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where is the incentive to work?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can any government justify paying people more money to stay at home than the taxpayers, who are contributing to this payment, are earning themselves?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can any society condone such an anomaly? . . . . Only through ignorance of the facts, surely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mentioned to other friends the income received by people on unemployment benefits and their reaction was one of disbelief!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To illustrate my point, assume my `typical' jobseeker was offered a full time position paying the award wage for the type of work he is skilled to do, ie. Nursery Hand:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nursery Hand's award per fortnight&mdash;$669.20</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">plus Basic Family Payment&mdash;$62.70</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional Family Payment&mdash;$185.70</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">net income&mdash;$812.60</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Needless to say, my friend was recently offered such a position and knocked it back, and who can really blame him? For truly, the fault lies with the social welfare system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployment benefits is meant to be a means of temporary income support for the jobseeker and his or her family, until such time as the recipient is able to obtain suitable work; and not as an alternative to work itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sooner all jobseekers are enticed to adopt genuine work ethics and view unemployment allowance as only temporary income support, then the sooner the country as a whole will benefit.</PARA>
<PARA>My constituent then goes on to suggest ways in which the social security system could be modified to eliminate some of the disadvantage currently occurring to those people who are in work. With the state of the national economy and with a million people out of work, there are many Australians genuinely seeking employment who are unable to obtain a job. However, the figures quoted in this example demonstrate that under the current situation many people are actually financially disadvantaged by bothering to go to all the trouble of maintaining a regular job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always been a keen supporter of some kind of work for unemployment benefit scheme. Such a program would not only discourage those who seek to loaf on their fellow Australians but, more importantly, help to maintain and extend the skills, the self-esteem and the work ethic of those who are unemployed. While our country has a clear obligation to care for the casualties of the national recession and to ensure that the families of those out of work, through no fault of their own, are not disadvantaged, it is also important that we provide appropriate incentive to ensure that every unemployed person is willing and eager to grasp any work opportunity which may arise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Australia has the capability to manufacture a limited range of equipment for value-adding wool industries. However, wool top making equipment is produced only in Europe and has never been produced in Australia because of its highly specialised application and the limited market demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. Both foreign and Australian owned enterprises have obtained TCFDA grants and it is expected that they will obtain a significant proportion of their equipment from overseas as suitable equipment is not available in Australia. They include the Australian subsidiaries of Bremer Woll-Kammerei of Germany and Chargeurs of France, and the Australian company, Australian Topmaking Services Ltd.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) (i) If a pensioner purchases shares by taking up a  rights issue after 18 August 1992, these shares will be assessed under the rules applying to shares acquired after 18 August 1992. This applies irrespective of when the shareholding on which the rights issue is made was acquired.

As a result an administrative task force was formed under the chairmanship of another official from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to make all the necessary administrative arrangements, including for security. Mr Holdich was nominated as Conference Secretary for the CHOGRM. In the lead-up to the CHOGRM he was responsible for the coordination of the policy briefing that was prepared for the Prime Minister to use in the Meeting and for liaison with the Commonwealth Secretariat in London. During the CHOGRM itself Mr Holdich was responsible for the smooth running of the Meeting and for liaison with the Commonwealth Secretariat on all matters relevant to the business of the Meeting, including the agenda, the preparation of notices, documents and records and the Meeting Communique.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) According to reports the House of Jenyns, a Brisbane lingerie manufacturer, will cease manufacturing in Australia in July next year and will concentrate its manufacturing operations in Asia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Australian labour costs are higher than those of Asia. Data from the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Authority indicate that for this type of clothing, even after accounting for on-costs, Australian labour costs are still around 12 times greater than those of many Asian countries. However, this does not take into account the higher levels of labour productivity in Australia relative to Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the on-costs referred to are State Government concerns (payroll tax and workers compensation) or are a matter for negotiation between workers and employers, such as holiday leave loading and long service leave.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among advanced western economies Australia has a competitive advantage when it comes to labour on-costs. In 1992, Australia's on-costs ranked fourth lowest out of the 19 OECD countries for which data were available, representing 25.4 per cent of total hourly remuneration, compared with an OECD average of 35.3 per cent. Given Australia's ranking on its level of on-costs, there is no reasonable justification for businesses to move offshore to avoid reasonable costs that provide for such things as worker compensation in the case of accidents and superannuation to fund retirement.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr Baldwin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Since March 1993, the assessment of income from managed investments (including listed trusts) has been based upon the actual performance of the investment product over the previous 12 months. This means that income is assessed only where there has been an improvement in the pensioner's financial circumstances. Where the investment performance has been negative, income losses are assessed, and these can be offset against other investment income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of these rules on pension entitlements also needs to take account of the overall operation of the pension income test. Pensioners are able to have assessable income of up to $2288 pa (single) and $3952 pa (married couple) before being affected under the income test. For income above these limits, pension is reduced by 50 cents for each dollar of income. Pension entitlement ceases at $19,000.80 pa (single) and $31,647.20 pa. (married couples). Consequently, pensioners must have a substantial level of assessable income (after any losses have been deducted) for large pension reductions to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensioners can, if they wish, realise a portion of their investment to make up any reduction in pension and thereby arrest any perceived hardship they might otherwise incur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, of course, a personal decision whether pensioners wish to sell all or part of their managed investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The social security income test looks at the means available to people to provide for their support, and determines how much they should be paid relative to how well they can support themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As nominal gains on managed investments are readily realisable, people are able to utilise them for their self-support. It would not be equitable to ignore gains on managed investments, as this would advantage clients who invested in these areas over clients who chose to use their savings to generate other forms of income, such as bank interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Capital growth on managed investments has been assessed as a form of income for social security pension purposes since 1 November 1983, either on withdrawal from the investment or on an ongoing basis. Prior to 1988, capital growth on managed investments was assessed as income when the investment was realised. Now, for all investments purchased after September 1988, capital growth is assessed as income during the term of the investment, and not on its realisation. One of the reasons these changes were made was to minimise the incidence of significant reductions in pension entitlement occasioned by assessing all capital growth on realisation of the investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach of assessing all returns on investments&mdash;whether in the form of unrealised gain or cash returns&mdash;ensures that all liquid investments are treated consistently, and that pensioners invest funds on the intrinsic merits of the investment rather than whether the investment is "pension friendly".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) If a person has been relying on the pension for support whilst preserving capital gains on managed investments, and their pension is subsequently reduced as a result of the assessment of capital gains, one possible option for that person is to utilise some of their capital gain to supplement their income. It is, of course, a matter of personal choice whether they adopt such a course of action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Comments on the level of national saving are a matter for the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Unrealised capital gains are assessed as income for managed investments, but not for investment real estate, for several reasons:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) managed investments are highly liquid and usually easily realised;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) managed investments have a relatively low unit price which means they can be sold in small parcels;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) shares and managed investments have a readily accessible market with known prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, real estate investments do not enjoy these features. Capital gains on real estate cannot normally be realised without liquidating the whole investment. Also, the market for real estate can be less accessible and more difficult to price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Pensioners can, and have for many years been able to, liquidate investments to finance home improvements, regardless of the form of such investments. Such action is not considered to be deprivation of income under the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is considered unlikely that people will liquidate all of their investments and spend the proceeds on the family home. As noted in the answer to Part (1), pensioners would, at the most, need to liquidate only a portion of their investment to replace any pension reduction. On this basis, pensioners would be worse off in terms of the liquid resources at their disposal by selling managed investments and spending the proceeds on their home in order to preserve their pension.</PARA>
