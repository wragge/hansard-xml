<PARA>This motion arises out of a report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Televising of the House of Representatives that you, Mr Speaker, tabled yesterday on the review of the arrangements for the televising of the House Representatives. Mr Speaker, you quite correctly, in the terms in which that committee had been set up, stated at the conclusion of your remarks that these guidelines having been arrived at were therefore automatically implemented. I think that what you said was correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, that was a most undesirable oversight of the House when we established and put the committee in place some years ago. No committee operating on behalf of this chamber and set up to discuss the proceedings of this chamber ought, on major issues, be empowered to change practice substantially without reference back to the chamber. I think giving the committee that authority is an oversight on our part. Parties are not permitted as a result of that to have a broader discussion within their organisations about the changes of practice that a committee brings down, unless we do something similar to that which is being done by the government today by taking sections of that report and restoring the status quo ante to allow that broader discussion, at least within our own ranks&mdash;it is up to the opposition to decide what to do in its ranks&mdash;of the issues raised in the committee's report. Only two sections of the committee's report have been picked up in this way in this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a series of other suggestions about how the camera work ought to be done in association with the broadcasting of parliament. They are not incorporated in this motion. What is incorporated are two specific areas which were the subject of some deliberation at the time this committee was set up. A great deal of thought was put into the regulations associated with them at that time. The regulations go to the way in which points of order and withdrawn remarks are rebroadcast. It is taken as read that in any direct broadcast of proceedings it will be absolutely impossible for us to put in place any processes which change the way in which the live performance is broadcast over the airwaves. In practical terms, this goes to the treatment of broadcasts in reproduction, in news services and in other programs, and in the production of a particular parliamentary broadcast when it is rebroadcast later in the evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very sound reasons why we originally chose to go down the road we did when we set in place these rules associated with the way in which points of order and other material might be broadcast. It is not sufficient to say that powers exist in other sections of the media&mdash;the print media, for example&mdash;to repeat what is said in this place in print form in any way, shape or form they see fit. I think it is true that the print media are not as fully aware of the privilege covering this place as they ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would apply equally to the rebroadcast on television of parliamentary materials as it does to the print media. For example, I think the press has missed the point of a ruling given a very long time ago by Speaker Snedden about the qualified nature of privilege on the repeating of materials in this chamber. I remember Speaker Snedden being very concerned about a habit developing in the chamber of people making adjournment speeches in which they heavily libelled others and then distributing or shunting those adjournment speeches around their electorates in order to deal with their enemies believing that they were under some form of parliamentary privilege. Speaker Snedden pointed out at that time that privilege in this place is absolute, but privilege in the way in which it is reported goes to context and context actually requires virtually the re-presentation of the entirety of a debate before that qualified privilege can be certain to be upheld in any subsequent action for libel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That applies to the print media, but there is a difference between the televised and print media. The televised media brings into stark focus in a way no other media do the presentation of any issue in this chamber. It provides an opportunity to focus on a very limited area and present it in such a way that people may be damaged way beyond the capacity of a newspaper report or anything like it to do that damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we originally looked at this matter we decided, for a very sound reason, that the most effective way of handling what amounts to the reportrayal of disorderly conduct in this place&mdash;that is, the raising of bogus points of order and, more particularly and more importantly than that, the delivery of remarks which are required by parliamentary processes to be subsequently withdrawn&mdash;was to place limitations on the ways in which that might be rebroadcast. This was done knowing that, when initially broadcast, those withdrawals and points of order would be placed in the context of the totality of the presentation of either that period of debate or, in practical terms, question time&mdash;which is all that people are really interested in broadcasting live&mdash;whereas when subsequently bits and pieces were extracted from question time that context could never be provided in the way in which that rebroadcasting was handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that points of order and abuse in this place which produce withdrawal are done for substantial political effect, not for the opportunity to actually correct somebody's behaviour under the standing orders. Nobody who sits in this place in question time can comprehend anything other than that bogus points of order are repeatedly raised and that no-one can do anything other than to acknowledge that, in the robust exchange here, we libel each other and others outside the parliament with great ferocity and that the withdrawal that results from that in no way requires apology or alternative explanation. Under the standing orders it is possible to get away with a muttered, `I withdraw', and that is the end of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion that one gets balance by the presentation of a remark which obliges withdrawal and then the subsequent withdrawal is a nonsense. Of course it does not. Basically what stands is the piece of abuse and the subsequent light-hearted retraction of it. The standing orders do not require apology and do not permit an opportunity for a person slated in this chamber to stand up and say, `You ought not to have called me that because these things apply and you were erroneous in your assumptions as to the detail of my character'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From our point of view these rules have been absolutely fundamental as far as basic, decent practice in this chamber is concerned. Whilst others in the chamber may differ, in his presentation to the committee the clerk was definitely of that point of view. Concerning withdrawn remarks, paragraph 2.25 of the committee's report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By contrast the Clerk of House of the Representatives stated that he would not favour the lifting of the prohibition on the televising of withdrawn remarks. He referred to a hypothetical situation where a Member, just before an election, could make an outrageous statement which could have serious political consequences. The Member could be ordered to withdraw the remark, but if the rebroadcast of withdrawn remarks was permitted, it would allow the remark to be rebroadcast.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no question about that. We all know the name of the game here. The situation to which the clerk referred is not a hypothetical situation, it is in fact our daily fare. There is not a question time that goes past when remarks on either side of the chamber are not required to be withdrawn. There is not a question time that goes past when a bogus standing order is not put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, a change of regulations in this area would permit acts of ratbaggery to be salient acts and would encourage disorderly conduct in this place. The clerk was right to warn about the potential for disorderly conduct being encouraged by remarks like this being put forward. No doubt there are some in the House who would look forward to an opportunity to slander the names of their colleagues and then make a bogus withdrawal. They would be cheerful about the fact that subsequently their remarks would be carried on evening news services. No doubt a number of honourable members in this place would delight at that prospect. It would be a sad day for the processes of this chamber if a majority of honourable members thought that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is moving these propositions to effectively recommit this issue for further consideration by the parties. It gives us a chance to discuss the committee report rather than have it automatically adopted in this chamber. We can then see the direction we ought to take. The government's motion also does one other thing: it restores the penalties associated with the initial requirements on the rebroadcasting of remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally in this area&mdash;and others&mdash;the committee has sought the capacity to be unbound by any set of guidelines as to how penalties might be applied. That is not appropriate. If penalties are to be provided in the area of broadcast activities, those penalties ought to be capable of being the subject of discussion in this place and not just be automatically accepted. I believe that is an essential protection for the committee. There will always be members who will have views as to how those requirements ought to be enforced when there is a transgression of the rules associated with broadcasting. Almost invariably, those views will be at variance, at least amongst some, with whatever decision the committee arrives at. In those circumstances, it is a protection for the committee if it knows it has in place a set of requirements that have been discussed in this chamber. Indeed, that was the case prior to the presentation of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is in the interests of anyone in this House to produce a set of circumstances that reward repeated disorderly behaviour. There has been enough rhetoric on both sides of this chamber&mdash;observed more in the breach than in the undertaking&mdash;about lifting standards and ensuring that the ways in which we treat each other, and people external to this place, are in accordance with what would be accepted as reasonable practice on the doorstep of any household that any of us might approach when we are going around canvassing at election time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that in the heat of discussion and debate this principle is not very easy to observe. In the cold light of day, when we are out there speaking about how we think of ourselves and what we think is significant in the way in which this chamber ought to conduct itself, we state things which are totally at variance with the way in which&mdash;within an hour or so&mdash;we are in fact operating in this place. Because we are incapable of meeting our own high standards when we make those presentations outside this chamber, we should not find ourselves rewarded when we stoop into the gutter. We would be rewarded if, in a rebroadcast of proceedings, people were capable of ignoring the entirety of what went on in question time to focus on a set of remarks&mdash;invariably libellous and invariably not germane to any issue of very serious import to this country, and which may not necessarily be offhand but studied&mdash;used to ridicule, destroy, or whatever, members either inside or outside this place. It has to be remembered that the withdrawal of remarks often protects people outside this chamber as well as those inside this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the way in which parliamentary proceedings have been rebroadcast, I do not think anyone can reasonably argue that the flavour and the content of any set of remarks or considerations in this chamber have not had reasonable opportunity for adequate coverage. We might disagree with it, but we have to acknowledge that often there is a hell of a lot more excitement and interest in the portrayal of this place when honourable members, who are not careful of the House's reputation, go a step further and move outside, or skirt around, the issues of policy and stoop to personal abuse. That personal abuse is then focused upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not sufficient to get up in this chamber and argue&mdash;as indeed it is argued in this report&mdash;that the print media can do it, that radio can do it, so why is television uniquely set aside for this treatment? All I can say is that those who would seriously argue that point have never been involved in a political campaign. Anyone can go to a set of surveys done by any advertising agency; anyone can look at the charts of charges that apply to advertising in any of the various sections of the media and know why television is different from any other element of portrayal of debate in this place. By a quantitative order of magnitude it is so massively more effective in getting a point into the lounge room of the average Australian that that quantitative difference takes on a qualitative character. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any serious student of the media and its role in politics could not conceivably, truthfully, come to any other conclusion. The very fact that this has been the focal point of interest for some considerable period of time is more than ample evidence of the fact that that is the case. If nothing else, the simple commonsense and experience of people in this chamber would be a demonstration of it. To get up and advocate the alternative here, to encourage this process or to argue that in some way or other it effectively meets the democratic principle, is simply a cover for a position aimed at rewarding bastardry in this place. There is no question about that. It is simply a cover for an opportunity to reward a piece of ratbaggery. When we look at the definitions of terms in the report, we see that it is simply that: a piece of ratbaggery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ratbaggery, by definition, must be withdrawn. The proposition here is that what, by definition, must be withdrawn can be rebroadcast unfettered&mdash;unfettered except for the fact that the withdrawal is obliged to be rebroadcast also. But everybody here knows very well how withdrawals take place. Many people in this chamber, including me, have been obligated to make a withdrawal. After a member has libelled someone, a simple statement here saying, `I withdraw', on the Speaker's instructions is all that is required. No apology or no alternative explanation from a person so libelled is in any way, shape or form required by the standing orders. That is fine. In the conduct of debate in this chamber it is reasonable that that should be the situation, but it ought not to be the situation that that behaviour be uniquely rewarded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not surprisingly, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was fairly flat and unenthusiastic. I am not the least bit surprised because let there be no doubt that behind this motion lies the long Italian hand of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Let there be no doubt at all that this is another exercise in prime ministerial hubris. Let there be no doubt that the Prime Minister seeks, through the instrument of the Leader of the House today, to maintain the outrageously lopsided set of procedures that this House operates under. Those procedures disgracefully favour the government. They unreasonably hobble the news networks of this country in their efforts to make a faithful reproduction of not only the answers given by ministers but the cut and thrust and the flow and flavour of question time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is using its numbers today at prime ministerial behest to overturn a decision of a committee of this parliament comprising a majority of the government's own members. This attempt by the Leader of the House&mdash;which will undoubtedly, with the weight of numbers, be successful&mdash;is a sorry reflection on you, Mr Speaker. You were the Chairman of the Standing Committee on the Televising of the House of Representatives. A unanimous decision was made by this committee. The committee comprised you, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron), the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks). Unanimously the committee decided that this restriction should go. The Leader of the House has come in here this morning at the behest of the Prime Minister. So full of hubris is the Prime Minister after some of the flattering press he got this morning that he has decided to reverse a decision which went through the committee unanimously and automatically came into effect last night. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision was made across party lines. It was not a coalition recommendation; it was a recommendation from the government's own committee. The Presiding Officer of this House chaired the committee. Only yesterday he announced that the committee's recommendations would take effect immediately. What is the Leader of the House concerned about? Why is he so worried about restoring a modicum of balance, particularly to question time?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House used an absolutely extraordinary argument. I want to take apart the one argument he advanced. He said the reason why television should not be allowed to reproduce points of order taken at question time is that many points of order are without substance. He actually used the words that points of order were taken to achieve a political purpose. Can he not accept that most answers given in this parliament, particularly by his Prime Minister, are given to achieve a political purpose?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently it is all right for the Prime Minister to get up at question time to traduce the reputation of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), to make all sorts of distorted, outrageous, dishonest, duplicitous, deceptive comments about the motives of the Leader of the Opposition. It is all right for those to be broadcast. The Prime Minister can say terrible things about the Leader of the Opposition that can go through the living rooms of Australia every night but, if the Leader of the Opposition or somebody on our side of the House attempts, by a point of order, to contradict a false allegation, that point of order cannot be reproduced. How can the Leader of the House possibly justify that double standard? He cannot. That is why his argument is a shabby, flimsy argument, and that is why he does not have his heart in this. He knows what I am saying is correct. He knows damn well that, if points of order are abused, so are ministerial answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quintessential abuse of the answer in this parliament is by the person whose hand is behind what the Leader of the House has done this morning, and that is the Prime Minister. Quite a number of people have said to me, `It is amazing Keating let that go through', but of course he has not. He cannot bear to allow a modicum of balance to come into this place. He once again displays that deep authoritarian and intolerant streak which is a hallmark of his approach to parliamentary politics. He likes to believe he is a great parliamentary performer. He is like a boxer in the ring when his opponent has one hand tied behind his back. Government members can be great performers when the rules are made to suit them and to suit them alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What more does the government want? Will it close down question time altogether next time? Will it deny us the right to ask questions? It has taken away censure motions; it has taken away matters of public importance. It denies free speech by this decision. Part of free speech is to broadcast what people say. There is not much free speech if people do not know what is said in this place. The networks asked unanimously, as I understand, that it be possible to reproduce points of order. The government is denying that request. Here is this great government that believes in freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that in the political arena, whenever the rules do not suit the government, it seeks to change those rules to its advantage. The government tried to do it with political advertisements, and the High Court knocked it over. This recommendation slipped through for 24 hours. I happened to talk to a representative of one of the networks only 10 minutes before I heard about this motion. The individual remarked to me how terrific it was and that it was something the networks had wanted for a long time. That sort of jubilation lasted less than 24 hours, until the Prime Minister caught up with events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process of course the government is delivering a snub to its own Speaker. It is a matter for him to decide how he feels about that, and I will say no more. But he was the chairman of this committee. Unanimously committee members decided to confer this normal entitlement on the news networks of Australia. The fact of course is that, when the Prime Minister caught up with this, he went berserk. I understand that he and the Speaker had quite an exchange about it, but that is a matter for the Speaker to handle. I put my case on the merits and on the facts. The Prime Minister wants the right to call people names such as sleaze-bags, scumbags and criminal garbage, and go unrebuked. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he can. Government members want that right. They want the Prime Minister to go on potentially for 45 minutes giving an answer and have the colourful bits run through the living rooms of the nation at night but, if somebody on our side has the temerity to get up and say, `Hang on. That is a bit rough. Under standing orders it is out of order', government members do not want that rebroadcast. Of course they do not. They are interested in running here a show, the rules of which are loaded to assist them. That is what they want, and every single action they take is designed to deny legitimate equality of expression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a debate at the present time about the nation's constitutional set-up. The government funds one side of the argument but not the other. It tried to knock off political advertisements because the Labor Party was broke in the lead-up to the last election. The Prime Minister has caught up with this and realises the potential for him to be exposed. Everybody who follows the proceedings of this parliament knows how much the Prime Minister abuses question time. He gives long, politically loaded answers, full of venom, bile and personal abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He wants the unrestricted right to have the colourful parts broadcast into the living rooms of Australia; but if anybody on our side dares to protest, that protest is not allowed&mdash;by his edict&mdash;to go into those same living rooms. The Leader of the House calls himself a democrat, a believer in equality of speech in this parliament. No wonder he showed a marked lack of enthusiasm for this motion. I cannot believe the Speaker did not run this matter past the Leader of the House before he made his announcement yesterday. I find it very hard to believe that my opposite number in this place did not turn his mind to it before the announcement. I find it very hard to believe that if he had turned his mind to it, he would have done other than&mdash;in a fair-minded fashion&mdash;come to the conclusion that the Speaker and the rest of the committee were absolutely right; the networks were right; and what I am saying today is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister found out about it, flushed with the heady hubris of yesterday, he thought, `While I am on a roll, I will knock over that mob opposite. I will not allow their points of order to be rebroadcast on the evening news bulletins'. That is what this is all about: bending the rules and behaving in an authoritarian fashion. It is classic old-style New South Wales Labor Party politics: if you have the numbers, use them and hang the principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a fine principle at stake. The Prime Minister talked yesterday about warming the hearts of the Labor Party for another couple of generations, but people's hearts can be warmed occasionally by a little simple faith in free speech. It is a pretty important thing in this country. Australians may seem pretty laid back about it, but if over a period of time they see one side loading it too heavily in its favour they go a bit feral. Those opposite can push their crude abusive numbers one or two steps too far. This is an example where that is being done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's proposal&mdash;a committee on which there was a majority of Labor Party members&mdash;was fundamentally decent and correct. It was not earth shattering; but it was correct. In the name of free speech, if it is all right to rebroadcast prime ministerial abuse in an answer and to broadcast a politically loaded answer to an apparently innocuous question, it ought to be all right to rebroadcast a politically loaded point of order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through you, Mr Speaker, does the Leader of the House really believe that one principle applies to the prime ministerial answer but another applies to the point of order? If the politics are out of order in the point of order, why are they not out of order in the answer? That is the logical dilemma. Put aside the rhetoric and look at the fairness and logic. That is the government's problem. Not only is this a crude use of numbers, in the worst possible way, but it does not have any logic or reason on its side. The Leader of the House knows that. I know that on occasions he likes to clothe his arguments with logic and reason. On this occasion, all of the logic and reason rests on the side of the decision taken by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was always intended that broadcasting the proceedings of question time, which is the most sought after part of the parliamentary day, would reflect not only the substance but also the flavour and the colour. Part of the flavour and colour of question time is the to-and-fro of points of order. Of course many points of order are politically loaded; but so&mdash;the Leader of the House must acknowledge in the name of fairness&mdash;are most answers. He knows that, I know that, we all know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it fair for the Prime Minister to say whatever he may want and have his answers rebroadcast but not fair for the Leader of the Opposition or me to take a point of order and have that point of order&mdash;perhaps of equal political content&mdash;rebroadcast? That is why what the government is doing is fundamentally illiberal. It is undemocratic and a repudiation of the good sense, impartiality and judgment of its own Speaker. It is a remarkable snub to the Speaker. It is perhaps 18 years since I have seen a government so openly and seriously snub its own Speaker. You know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everything, so it seems, must be sacrificed on the altar of the Prime Minister's overweening hubris. That is what this is all about. The Prime Minister believes, flushed with some favourable headlines this morning, that he can get away with an abuse of the numbers he has in this House. The government does not have merit, logic or decency on its side. The only thing it has on its side is the true weight of numbers. Sometimes that does not succeed in the bar of public opinion. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

This proposal that has been brought forward today by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is a gigantic leap; but not a leap forward. It is a leap back into our dark past, a drop back into history, taking us back to the dim dark ages of communication.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest institutions in the parliament is the committee system which operates not only here in the House of Representatives but also in the Senate. The committee that was set up with you, Mr Speaker, as the head, crossed party lines and looked at every angle and respect of this matter. It came back to the parliament with a unanimous decision&mdash;across party lines and represented by every party in this place. It looked at what is a most important issue. When we are elected to this place by our constituents&mdash;we are here by their vote and at their discretion&mdash;they expect communication. They expect us to put forward their issues in this House and they expect that those issues will be communicated to the government and to other members so that they can see we are representing them. They can hear the proceedings on radio on broadcast days and now, with the advent of television, they are able to see some of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What they will be able to see, if this motion by the Leader of the House goes through, will still be the one-sided and edited version of what occurs in this place. If this motion is successful; if the government, by virtue of its numbers, forces it through this House, we will still see a one-sided picture. There will be no response by way of points of order. As my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong said, the opposition sometimes has the opportunity&mdash;not always&mdash;on matters of procedure to take a point of order and to make a political point on a point of order, just as the Prime Minister or another minister may respond to a question at question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But communication is a two-way street. If the proceedings of this House are able only to be broadcast but not televised in greater detail to the people who put us in this place, we will have a breakdown of the communication processes between our constituents and us. All they will see will be a one-sided display of what occurs in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is taking us back at least 10 years. Is it frightened about television? Is it frightened that the opposition parties might bring up something which will embarrass it? Is that not what opposition is about&mdash;keeping governments accountable?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what democracy is about, as my colleague the honourable member for Aston says. This proposal is about democracy. It is about enabling the people, who elect us to represent their interests, to see the executive government held to account. That is why we have ministers. The ministers have to accept the responsibility that they are accountable not only for the administration of their departments but also to the people of Australia, who want to see that the government of this country is run in a true and democratic way. How can we communicate that to the public without the expansion of the television coverage of this House?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When television was first introduced into the House, it was introduced virtually as a trial, as, no doubt, was the broadcasting of parliament when it first commenced in the old Parliament House back in the 1940s. Now the government is trying to overrule a committee which was served by some very fine members who have given their time and thought to this issue. They have looked at the trial over a period and said, `This trial has been successful, but there are still flaws in it because the democratic processes are not being served as well as the public demands they should be. The public has a right to see that the government and the ministers take responsibility and are accountable to the Australian community in accepting that responsibility to administer government in a true, fair and democratic manner'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite obvious that the Prime Minister has given instructions to the Leader of the House that this matter is not to proceed, despite recommendations from what, as I have said, is one of the great institutions of this parliament, the committee system, which meets across all party boundaries, right across party lines, and tackles the very hard decisions which not only the government but maybe the coalition is having difficulty with. The members of all the parties sit down in this committee framework and reach decisions which they believe are in the true and best interests of the Australian community&mdash;not in the interests of members of the House but in the interests of the people we represent out there, who have no voice in this chamber or the Senate chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty of some of those decisions over the years has been excruciating for some committees. All of the too-hard basket questions end up with parliamentary committees. Members of committees go through the processes, do a lot of soul searching and look at the evidence that has been put before them. There has been some well-documented evidence put forward through the trial processes that we have had with the televising of the parliament. The message has been communicated to members of the public that the members of parliament who represent them are here keeping the government accountable and making sure that it is responsive to what the community wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the proposal brought forward by the Leader of the House this morning what the government is saying is, `We'll show you what we think you should see'. It is another form of censorship. It is interesting to see the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) sitting at the table. He surely could not condone this motion, because what the government is saying is, `We will restrict what the public will see coming out of their house of parliament, their parliament which is representing their interests'. How could the Minister for Justice possibly support saying, `We will restrict what you see. We won't let you see anything that the opposition parties might bring up which holds us accountable. We won't show you that. We will show you only the nice things which the government is doing.'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot possibly tolerate that in Australia because that is the first step of breaking down our democratic processes in this House&mdash;to cut off the communication between this parliament and members of the public who elect us. How can the Minister for Justice sit there and support this? He should be over here fighting the government on this issue. He should be supporting the recommendation brought down by the Speaker of this House and the committee, which comprised representatives of all of the parties. The committee took this on board, weighed up the evidence, looked at what has happened in the historical period that we have had television coverage in this House and made a decision that it should proceed a little further; that we should be able to expand this television coverage so that everyone in this House has the opportunity to take a point of order and bring the executive government to account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members talk to people in the community, they will find that members of the public think too many decisions are made behind closed doors. They want to see and know what is happening. That is where radio broadcasting has helped. But why not give them the visual coverage so that they can see exactly what is happening in here and what the government is doing? We should make government members accountable, put them on the stand and let them tell the public exactly what is going on. The committee has deliberated long and hard and taken into consideration all of the aspects of providing that communication to people out in the community. After all, they are the people that we represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the claims of the Leader of the House is that the government is a progressive government. But the government is going to start censoring what comes out of this place. It is going to restrict the ability of the community to see what comes out of the parliament. It is going to prevent the public from seeing how it is held to account. It is all very fine for executive government to make decisions in the ministerial wing and to come in here and, simply because it has the weight of numbers, bulldoze this measure through, knock it out and prevent people from seeing how the government is held to account. It is an absolute disgrace, and it is a black day for this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a black day for the committee system because the government has brought into disrepute the committee system established by this parliament. The recommendation of the committee was supported unanimously. The Leader of the House heard about it in this House yesterday and heard what the Speaker had to say in support of it. Yet suddenly, overnight, the Prime Minister has stepped in and said this will not proceed. He has said to the Australian public, `We are going to censor what you see coming out of the Australian parliament. We will decide what you should see in relation to what occurs in this House'. There is no way that the Australian community should have to tolerate that type of decision making by any government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why the left wing of the Labor Party is supporting this. Where is the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), the leader of the left wing? He should be over on this side of the House supporting us. He should be on this side of the House this morning supporting freedom, communication and democracy&mdash;all of the things that he believes in and stands up for. I will be very interested to see where all of the left wing members of the Labor Party sit when this matter is resolved,  because I think that they could not possibly go back to their faction and say, `We supported this. We supported the suppression of information coming out of the Australian parliament, we supported the restriction of information to the people who elected us, and we supported the repression of a flow of information contrary to what had been recommended by a joint parliamentary committee comprising members of both sides of this chamber'. I find it an absolute disgrace. I think that the comments that the honourable member for Bennelong has made have brought the government to account and it should not proceed with this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for O'Connor says we are. I am glad the honourable member is going to take part in this debate because he is probably one of the better examples of why these provisions should be maintained. We heard the honourable member for Bendigo talk about censorship and how terrible it was that some things that are said here cannot be shown. The honourable member for Bennelong went on at great length about how we should televise, in his words, politically loaded points of order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Bendigo that they should have looked at the standing orders before they made those rather outrageous and silly statements. The standing orders of this place provide specifically that one cannot make remarks that reflect on another member. But the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Bendigo not only want to be able to flout that; they want to be able to do that and get a run on the television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Bendigo have said, this is an argument about what we will televise and what we will not televise. Why is there great interest in televising? It is because television is a most powerful medium. It is the most powerful medium that there is. It is also the medium that is most susceptible to stunts. Television does not go in for editorialising. Television does not give one the whole story. Television is made up of short grabs. The 6 o'clock news is about little pieces of information from which people draw inferences.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those members who have spoken against the proposal by the Leader of the House want to see those sorts of stunts&mdash;and that is all they are&mdash;rewarded. The honourable member for Bennelong might unjustifiably&mdash;or even justifiably&mdash;feel that the standing orders do not let opposition members do and say what they would like to do and say. I remind him, as I have reminded him here frequently in the past, that the great majority of the present standing orders were determined by members of his party when they were in power. They determined them&mdash;in the words of some of his colleagues in the past&mdash;in an attempt to make sure that they had their way. If the honourable member for Bennelong is worried about that, maybe the solution was in his hands in those days. He should have made sure he was a little more liberal and democratic then than he says he wants to be now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standing orders are there to protect the dignity of the House. For members to come in here and say that we should not only have a mechanism whereby we can stand up and make all sorts of outrageous allegations and stupid points of order, but also have a reward by seeing such actions televised on the news that night, is just a joke, and they know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proof is in the pudding. The proof in the pudding is that 90 per cent of the points of order that are made are out of order. Very few points of order are upheld by those occupying the chair in this place, be they members of the Labor, Liberal or National parties, because most of them are not in order; most of them are stunts that are attempted to be used by people to break up someone else's speech or, as the honourable member for Bennelong said, inject a politically loaded point into the middle of question time. The censorship in this is in the standing orders because the standing orders say that members cannot do that. But those opposite want to be able to not only do it but get a reward for it. That is a little bit of extravagant hypocrisy in my view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that opposition members have only spoken about this one area. They have only talked about politically loaded points of order and why they should be able to do that. It is very interesting that we have not heard from the honourable member for Bennelong about the other parts of this proposed resolution&mdash;the part that relates to the rebroadcasting of withdrawn remarks. No doubt the honourable member for O'Connor will get up and say he thinks we should be able to rebroadcast withdrawn remarks, but I do not think many other people in this place would want to justify that. That is the other side of the coin of censorship&mdash;that is, having people use this place to make outrageous allegations and attacks on people under the cloak of parliamentary privilege and, having done that, having withdrawn those remarks in the House, get the reward of having them run on television that night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is bad enough when people come in here and make unsubstantiated attacks on individuals. It has always been to my sorrow that the House never accepted the Senate's standing order which allows individuals from outside this place to have the Presiding Officer come in and run their defence for them. The House never took up that recommendation of the Standing Committee on Procedure when I was a member of it. Maybe in the future that will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is being argued here is that we should go further&mdash;that members should be able to stand up in this place, make an outrageous and disgraceful attack on somebody, be asked by the chair to withdraw it, in a sotto voce way say, `I withdraw, Mr Speaker', and then have it run on the 6 o'clock news that night. They have stood up in front of all their colleagues and withdrawn it; it is implied in the withdrawal, if one reads <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, that they are not only withdrawing, but apologising. So they stand up and say, `Look, I was wrong, I apologise, but thank God they are going to run it on the news tonight. I'll get them, won't I?'. That is what the honourable member for Bendigo and the honourable member for Bennelong&mdash;and, no doubt, the honourable member for O'Connor&mdash;are arguing we should do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is really pretty good stuff, is it not? Honourable members can come in here and say anything. They can even retract it, but they can then go and see their mates in the media and say, `That was a nice little red hot number I gave you today; put it on, won't you?'. Of course, they will do so. Why does the media want to run these things? It is because it is interested in the circus of the place. It is not interested in the substance of the place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that members of the media used to come and see me about when I was the Speaker was that they wanted to do these two things, and the other thing they talked about was that they wanted to film disorder in the place. They wanted to be able to film someone jumping from the balcony into the chamber. They wanted to be able to film the honourable member for O'Connor being taken out of the chamber by the Serjeant-at-Arms when he refused to leave the chamber one day after being named. They want to run this minutiae. That is the sort of thing they want to run. They do not want to run the decent speeches that the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) might make in this place. They want to show that sort of stupidity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think any opposition member is actually going to be game to get up and say that they want withdrawn remarks to be able to be run. I would find it incredible if someone did, because it is an absolute nonsense. It is an absolute nonsense that someone should be able to come in here, slander somebody terribly, withdraw in front of his colleagues, but still be able to have that slander run on television later that night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At issue here is the question of whether politically loaded points of order will be run, and whether disgraceful, and in most cases unwarranted, attacks on people&mdash;which have been withdrawn, resiled from and apologised for&mdash;will be run. I do not know why any honourable member would want some remark that he or she had withdrawn and, by implication, apologised for, run on television that night. I do not know why any honourable member would want to do that unless he or she had come in here with malice in their hearts and with the deliberate intention of using the standing orders to make the allegation, quickly withdraw it, sit down and see the person so maligned get a run on television later that evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some members of the opposition have demonstrated an interesting change of heart here today. It would be interesting to know whether the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) agrees with the honourable member for Bennelong because, in his submission to the committee, the Leader of the Opposition wrote:</PARA>

Committees meet, they report to the House, there is some discussion and the House makes a decision.

No-one would suggest that the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) should stand up here, make his report, sit down and leave it at that. People will want to have something to say about the matter. On this particular issue, the honourable member for Bennelong forgot to put in the submission that his colleague said he would be making. He has a chance to have his say now, and that is as it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that anyone can substantiate an argument for having these malicious, withdrawn statements run on television.

He is a former Speaker and, as I understand it, a former chairman of this committee&mdash;a committee of which I have been a member for some time. I believe that this committee has adopted a very responsible attitude. Although we want the people of Australia to be well informed about what is happening in the parliament, one of our main aims was to ensure that parliament is not brought into disrepute, and we have worked very hard to that end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been a member of the committee since its formation. We have nursed along the issue of the televising of parliament in order to achieve the satisfaction of ensuring that the people of Australia are well informed about what is happening here, while at the same time ensuring that the parliament is not brought into disrepute. I know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is very concerned about some of the recommendations, but those recommendations show how very keen we have been to do that. We do not want television footage of people jumping off balconies into the chamber, and the recommendations ensure that we will not be seeing that. In many other areas as well we have made sure that nothing will take place that will harm the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have sat in this parliament day after day for many years now and I have witnessed the parliament degenerating.

I warn the people of Australia that they will get more of the same&mdash;the taking on of dictatorial powers&mdash;if that is the way we go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard those same speakers on the government side who talk about what should not be allowed to happen in the parliament almost denigrate their colleagues in this place by suggesting that we are playing politics when we stand up to take points of order. We are allowed to stand up and take points of order. It is part of the democratic system under which we live. On any one day, there could be 500 people in the gallery watching what is going on in the parliament. Why should people watching their television sets not be able to do the same? Is this some form of censorship? Do we have the right to tell people what they are allowed to see of this parliament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have sat here and watched this parliament gradually deteriorate. There is a limit on the number of questions that can be asked and on the way in which those questions are answered.

In my electorate of Riverina we have a number of difficulties. The farming sector has a serious problem. There is high unemployment. When I come in here at question time I want some answers, but I am not getting any. We are becoming frustrated by the way in which this parliament is being run. We want some answers from the government. The only recourse we have is to stand up on a point of order and ask the Prime Minister of the day to please answer our questions. We are here to represent our electorates and our people want to know what he is going to do to overcome these problems. The electorate is used to rudeness. </PARA>

You are not just talking about our side of the parliament; you are also talking about your own side of the parliament.

The first issue is a resolution of this parliament in contravention of a decision of the Speaker to prevent the rebroadcast on television of points of order. It is a joke. I just do not know why those opposite are that frightened. It is not an issue. There is minimalist evidence of actual points of order being used in an abuse of the process. The honourable member for Herbert says that they are frivolous. I do not know. Various speakers have ruled differently on that point. Standing order 98 unequivocally gives members the right to take a point of order and to take it in the forms of the parliament. Immediately they are not, they can be rolled, they can be punished and they can be kicked out. Why remove it from being televised? Those opposite are worried that their Prime Minister in the public eyes, if not in the eyes of the Speaker, may be found to be irrelevant. Maybe they will side with us on the point of order. I am sure they are not worried about my being found frivolous and irrelevant. I just could not believe that. That is the risk I take if this is publicised. I am quite happy to take that risk. Those opposite are worried and, more importantly, the man who has organised this vote of no confidence in the Speaker is worried that people will wake up to what is being done. For what reason? The committee as a whole has said that it is appropriate to rebroadcast points of order, and of course it is. It is fundamental to the process of any debating forum. It is not prevented anywhere else. It is not prevented in the Senate. Members of this House were whingeing a little while ago about how we were giving the Senate powers for which it was not entitled.

I refer honourable members to the remarks of their colleague the Clerk of the House of Representatives.

When honourable members who have been in parliament for any length of time look back on some of the things they have said and done there is not one of them who would not say, with a view to a more charitable disposition for people in opposing political parties, that perhaps they could have been a little bit more charitable on a particular occasion.

He had a fairly lurid account for me of the marital situation of that particular minister. I said to him, `What have you got for me about his irresponsibility in his portfolio?'. There was no suggestion of that at all. The important point was that if I, as Leader of the Opposition, wanted to raise this, using some of the forms of the House, I could be guaranteed front page coverage for several days. I presented my compliments to his editor and told him that if he wanted to run that sort of material he was free to run it but that Her Majesty's opposition was not going to deal with that level of politics. </PARA>

It was an event that occurred every day of the week in my community but it was front page news because he was the Speaker of this parliament&mdash;and the same standard will be applied to all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do opposition members think for one moment that it is freedom to change the standing orders of this place so that honourable members can make an allegation in here, withdraw and apologise but still have it run by the media? Is that freedom? That is giving the people who run the media the right to censor what happens in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen great speeches made in this parliament but they have never got the coverage in the media, particularly on television, which is afforded a decent stoush at question time. A few angry words, a few angry exchanges, uncharitable remarks outside the framework of the standing orders, which will be withdrawn, will always get a better headline than a thoughtful or a deliberative speech from whichever side of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I say, on the basis of my own not inconsiderable experience&mdash;I am still in the position where most opposition members have not spent as much time in opposition as I have; so I understand their frustration and feelings&mdash;that it should be remembered that we are all simply passing through this place. We all have a duty to the institution of parliament to maintain concepts which have come down over generations of parliamentarians and make these institutions perform their functions more effectively. Cheap shots and political muckraking take place from time to time in every parliamentary institution that I have ever seen, because that is the nature of politics in our community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Getting away with it is not okay, but at least it is within the standing orders. Let me give a simple example. Just as the honourable member for O'Connor probably has a file on me, I explained on one occasion in the heat of question time how he came to get his nickname, `Iron Bar'. I do not have to go over that again; I have done that. It was not charitable, but it was truthful. Of course, I said things that I think I withdrew.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members are now saying that that is all right, that is all fair game, because the manager of the local television station can run that in full. There have been personal exchanges from both sides across that table which have not done this institution any credit at all. Dealing in marital relationships or any of that stuff is of no interest to the development of this political institution, and the community does not expect it. But opposition members are now saying that, when that occurs, it will be all right if the manager of the local television station reckons that is worth a few points and runs it&mdash;even though it is withdrawn and apologised for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we should look to the wisdom of the clerks, as Speakers and this parliament have often done in the past. Looking to the view of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, the evidence that was given was about not merely the past of this institution and the hard lessons that have been learned from time to time, but about the future of this institution, how it relates to the rest of the community and, more importantly, how it sees itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all said things in this place which we may subsequently regret. We have all said things that are uncharitable. That is part of the process. But the institutions of Westminster and the Westminster tradition have learned how to deal with that. This particular concept and the recommendation that has been made go against those traditions and, if we accept the recommendation&mdash;and I do not care who has signed it&mdash;it will lead this institution into nothing but trouble. It will deliver even more power to those who run the media and the press in this country. </PARA>

The report which is being debated here today or parts thereof&mdash;and I repeat that it is parts thereof because there are substantial other parts of the report which are not the subject of this particular motion&mdash;was tabled in this place by me yesterday in my capacity as chairman of the Standing Committee on the Televising of the House of Representatives.

<PARA>Mr Speaker, I move dissent from your ruling for the very simple reason that we have just had a very lengthy and I think a very useful debate about a decision taken by the government to overturn a unanimous decision of a committee of this House, having the full authority of this House, which was chaired by you. The whole thrust of our argument in that debate was that by not allowing the full rebroadcasting of what takes place at question time the government was conferring an unfair advantage on the government. Colourful, critical, offensive or insulting remarks could be made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other ministers during question time and those remarks could be rebroadcast over the airwaves in the evening. We on this side of the House had absolutely no opportunity&mdash;through a point of order, interjection or interruption&mdash;to restore some balance to the flow of question time because of this restriction introduced by the government in defiance of a recommendation of a committee chaired by you. Do you know what the reply of the government was in the course of that debate, what the reply of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was and what the reply of the former Speaker, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), was?</PARA>

Audibly to all of us on this side of the House, the first remark the Prime Minister made when he entered the chamber was, `What are you grubs up to now?'. That was the first remark the Prime Minister made. Then when there was some comment made about free speech from this side of the House, do you know what the Prime Minister's reply was?

Everybody on the government and opposition front benches knows damned well what the Prime Minister said when he came in here.

In my experience, when there is some legitimate doubt as to whether a remark has been made, normally the Speaker would ask the person, `Did you make the remark complained of?'. If the answer is, `Yes, I made that remark', the Speaker then asks the opposition, `Do you find that remark offensive?'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I repeat that the core of our complaint in relation to this point of order is that a remark was made which was clearly audible to me and four or five of my colleagues on the front bench, and I am sure clearly audible to the Leader of the House, who is an honest man. I challenge him to deny having heard what the Prime Minister said. The Leader of the House is an honest bloke and I trust him on questions such as this. He knows quite well that the Prime Minister made the remark complained of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We resent this most of all and have moved this motion of dissent because I would have expected you, Mr Speaker, to at least have asked, `Prime Minister, did you make that statement?'. It would then have been on the Prime Minister to decide whether he was going to be deliberately economical with the truth again, as is his wont, or whether he was going to own up to the fact and withdraw the remark. But you did not do that, Mr Speaker, and that is why I am moving dissent from your ruling, and that is why I think you are wrong. That is why I think, for good and substantive reasons, not insubstantial reasons, the parliament ought to support my motion of dissent from your ruling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background of this has to be understood. There has been almost two hours of debate on a matter of very important parliamentary principle: whether there should be equality of rebroadcasting opportunities of the proceedings of question time and the proceedings in this parliament. One must bear in mind that the whole substance of the government's defence of its decision to repudiate you, Mr Speaker, and all the other members of the committee, is that if anything is said that should not be said there is machinery available under the standing orders to make certain that those words are withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is exactly what I decided to do; I decided to put that argument to test. I thought, `Maybe the Leader of the House is right, maybe the honourable member for Watson is right and maybe I have it all wrong. What I will do is take a point of order and rely on the interpretation of those opposite of the standing orders, the forms and conventions of this parliament. I will say, "Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister has said something; it is very offensive to be collectively described as vermin'". Those words may come freely to the lips of the Prime Minister, but they are not the sorts of words somebody aspiring to be some great national hero should be using. He freely uses those sorts of words. Against that background, I listened to a very impassioned speech from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), who I think makes a very interesting contribution to the deliberations of this parliament. I thought that maybe I had got it all wrong and that maybe I was under a total misapprehension as to how the standing orders should operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought I would put it to the test; that I would do the very thing the government said could be done to stop remarks such as, `You are all vermin' being made without there being a requirement that it be withdrawn. So I put it to the test. I said, `Let's find out whether what those opposite have been saying is fair dinkum or not; let's find out whether my understanding of how the standing orders operate is fair dinkum'. It did not take very long to find out who was right and who was wrong. Mr Speaker, you did not even ask the Prime Minister whether he had made the remark. I know that you may not be on speaking terms with him at the present time as a result of what happened this morning, but at least you might have done it, Mr Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and time again when there have been exchanges such as this across the floor of the House, the normal practice of the Speaker is to ask the person who made the allegedly offensive remark, `Did you make that remark?'. That has happened from time immemorial. The honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who is a practitioner of this House, knows that that is the case; the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who is a practitioner of this place, knows that is the situation; and so does the Leader of the House. Yet we are expected to cop a ruling such as this, having been lectured for two hours about how balanced, fair, reasonable and decent the standing orders of this place are, and having been told that they are all designed to stop ministers, and Prime Ministers in particular, making offensive attacks on the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complaint made by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in his contribution to the debate was to the effect that the nature of the standing orders is that generalised slurs cannot be withdrawn. That was our very argument. It is the reason that half an hour ago you, Mr Speaker, unconscionably loaded the rules of this House even more in favour of the government. That is why I took the point of order. I thought that at the very least, against the background of this whole incident, you would have said, `Prime Minister, did you say collectively to the opposition, "This is designed to keep vermin like you off the air."?'. Those words were said clearly by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You said, `There is a lot of noise during divisions and it is often very hard to hear'.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the attention of the Speaker is drawn to words used, he shall determine whether or not they are offensive or disorderly.</PARA>
<PARA>You have failed on that count, Mr Speaker. That is charge No. 1 today. You had the responsibility to carry out standing order 78 in the interests of upholding your duties as Speaker. You failed to uphold that responsibility because you did not ask the Prime Minister whether he used those words and whether, therefore, he would withdraw those words. I take the point of order of the honest Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and on that technical point, Mr Speaker, I quote from page 485 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the duty of the Chair to intervene when offensive or disorderly words are used either by the Member addressing the House or any Member present.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the Chair determines that offensive or disorderly words have been used, the Chair intervenes and asks that the words be withdrawn.</PARA>

So it was not an unreasonable hurdle which we invited you to jump today in terms of maintaining the traditions of this parliament, but you did not jump, Mr Speaker. Why not? It is because you have been got at. You have been got at in the last 24 hours in a way which left you swinging in the breeze in a very unsatisfactory way for members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the House to the fact that it is the Prime Minister who is the cause of both the previous motion and this proper dissent motion being moved today.

That is quite appropriate. You are on the job whilst ever you sit in that chair. You are on the job in terms of maintaining the decorum of the parliament whilst ever you sit in that chair. It is entirely appropriate for members to take points of order in divisions. There are procedures for that. It is entirely appropriate that you respond to those points of order. However, we are moving a motion of dissent because you stopped short in your response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday you responded on the matter of the Ku Klux Klan. You will remember that the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker) said that the members of the opposition were members of the Ku Klux Klan. That was a pretty abrasive comment to make on the floor of the House. You immediately responded and asked the Special Minister of State to withdraw that comment. Why then did you not require the Prime Minister today to withdraw the equally bad statement that he made in relation to vermin; a statement that was clearly heard on both sides of the House?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, you have torn up convention by your conduct in the chair today. You, sir, have lost the confidence of members on this side of the House by your conduct in the chair this day, and on other days as well. You, sir, have presided over a situation where there has been a steady deterioration in the number of questions that members are allowed to ask in the course of question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To your credit, on 6 October you ruled in part that answers should be relevant and `not excessively long'. However, you immediately drifted away from that ruling. That is why we charge you this day, Mr Speaker, by virtue of this dissent motion, with failing to respond to standing order 78. In the context of what that standing order required of you, you should at least have asked the Prime Minister whether he made that statement. If he had, you should have told him that it was unparliamentary language and required him to withdraw it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has happened in the past. It happened as late as yesterday, but today something is different. We know what is different.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some were required to be withdrawn. The brilliant proof of that is right here in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 8 March 1984, page 752, which records an exact replica of this incident. When the then Treasurer used the word `vermin', he was instantly required to withdraw it. Today, nine years later, when in the course of this debate he again used the word `vermin', as verified by my colleagues on the front bench, as can be verified by you if you act honestly, why was he not required to withdraw? The answer for the Leader of the House, when he speaks at the dispatch box, is to confirm that the Prime Minister did utter that word `vermin' and therefore confirm that indeed this motion of dissent is correct and he should in fact withdraw.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I make the point, Mr Speaker, that we have absolute double standards in relation to the application of your duties as custodian of the responsibilities of this House. It is an unacceptable double standard, and it is a double standard which will only be addressed if this dissent motion is carried by the House on this occasion, because otherwise we will have a continuing deterioration of fair conduct and fair play and modus operandi in relation to the proceedings of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, the opposition and the Independents are all entitled to reasonable protection under the standing orders and under parliamentary practice and the parliamentary conventions. The convention, the precedent, is absolute. Here is the word `vermin'&mdash;it was asked to be withdrawn. It was the same culprit then as today, the Prime Minister up to his mischief once again. Shame on him. But the main point of this debate is you, Mr Speaker, and your discharge of the onerous responsibilities that you have as Speaker of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had you asked one other question on the occasion, none of this dissent would have taken place. That was simply, in accordance with longstanding convention, to invite the Prime Minister to confirm or otherwise whether he had stated those words and then invite him to withdraw them. That is not too much of a hurdle in all the circumstances. It is not mitigated by the fact that it took place in division; not at all. There are responsibilities you are required to have and continue to have in division. It is for those reasons, Mr Speaker, that we are absolute in our support of the dissent motion and point out to you, sir, that you have failed in the conduct of the duties of the House and in your responsibilities to the House by your total and abject failure to require of the Prime Minister that he withdraw those comments. They are unparliamentary and unacceptable, and therefore there should have been no hesitation on your part in asking for that withdrawal.

So it should have in those circumstances. It was quite clear from the context that the honourable member for Farrer described that it was being presented in the course of a debate. Obviously the then Treasurer was standing at the dispatch box making that point, the word was called upon to be withdrawn and it was withdrawn. In the context of the debate it was, firstly, clearly audible to the Speaker; secondly, in the context of proceedings which would be recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>; and, thirdly, picked up by the opposition at that point of time, and at that point of time a withdrawal was called for.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Page 311. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decorum should prevail during a division, and it is not in order for Members to engage in debate or exchange remarks across the Chamber. Conversation audible to the Chair has been regarded as disorderly. Remarks made during a division are not regarded as part of the proceedings of the House and are not recorded by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA>There is clearly a very different situation applying. If during a division the Speaker hears across the chamber a set of remarks being made, he may choose&mdash;he is not obliged to, he may choose&mdash;to intervene to require a withdrawal or some other process to quieten the place down. It is clearly a different situation from that when the person is operating in the normal course of debate in this place, and that differential has effectively been established by the operations of these standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly you did not hear any remarks passed across the chamber during that division, Mr Speaker. If you had, you may have chosen to cause those to be withdrawn or have chosen to ignore them. The fact of the matter is that you did not hear any remarks that were exchanged across the chamber. You will never get to hear or read those remarks because any remarks passed across the chamber during a division will simply not be recorded and not enter into the parliamentary record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of seeking withdrawal of unparliamentary language or of epithets that honourable members find offensive and all the rest of it is that what is said in this chamber goes into the record, is capable of being disseminated and stands against the member or members concerned for all time, as long as the country shall last and records are kept. That is one of the reasons, apart from preserving good order in the place, why the Speaker acts to protect the reputation of members when there is a requirement for him to do so. But none of that occurs in the course of an interchange in a division, unless people are silly enough to want to place that interchange on the record subsequently. During a division none of that occurs. Therefore, the Speaker is in a situation where, in order to maintain the order of the place, if he hears a discussion that he finds unparliamentary or whatever, he may act to deal with it, but he is not obliged to query anyone in the chamber on remarks that may be exchanged during that period of time, because those remarks are not part of the proceedings of this House. They are not part of the proceedings of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that, of course, honourable members do have to be a little careful because remarks that are exhaled in those exchanges are not necessarily the subject of coverage by privilege either. From time to time, in some of the interchanges that I have heard, remarks have simply been directed at a generality and are, therefore, unlikely to be the subject of any legal action, as it is virtually impossible to libel a class. Considering some of the epithets that I hear across the chamber from time to time directed personally at individual members about the legality of their actions or the truthfulness with which they conduct themselves, it would be as well for members of this chamber to recognise that they are not necessarily covered by parliamentary privilege during a division. It is a pretty open question in legal circles as to whether or not that is the case. There is argument both at state parliamentary level and from this chamber that goes both ways on that issue. Clearly, there is precedent that establishes a different order of events for what is taking place when we are officially in session and another set of arrangements for when we are not actually formally engaged in the proceedings of this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I get back to the point. It is only sensible that the chamber should recognise that. It is sensible that the chamber should have one set of attitudes and one set of procedures about words that will become part of the historical record and therefore need corrections, and other sets of words which do not require that at all. When the House is in its full proceedings, those standing orders, 77 and 78, apply that oblige action from the Speaker to deal with that sort of problem, whether or not the Speaker happens to have heard remarks during an interchange. If those remarks are drawn to his attention the Speaker shall act under standing orders 77 and 78 to deal with them. In the course of a division, the position is put as permissive; and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> only goes to describing a set of circumstances in which he, the Speaker, has himself heard the remarks that have been exchanged across the chamber. The Speaker has quite clearly established that in this case that was not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition, in using this motion as another way of getting at the government or whatever, and choosing to do so through you, Mr Speaker, is effectively trying to turn important distinctions in standing orders on their head. Do they not always get into it when they get an opportunity to do so! The real standing orders and the actual application of the standing orders are neither here nor there as far as the opposition is concerned, and those opposite will take any opportunity not to challenge you on the veracity of the way in which you control standing orders but simply fling epithets at you and attempt to get at the government via that process. It is simply a standard pattern of practice on the part of the opposition for mauling the Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You, sir, in your ruling, were absolutely correct. You are entitled to the defence of members of this House, whether or not they like what they think they heard from the Prime Minister, whether or not they think that what they think they heard from the Prime Minister was in accordance with what would normally be the interchange in this place.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Acting Treasurer. Given that the Prime Minister acknowledged on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> last night that the compensation bill for native title is likely to be many hundreds of millions of dollars, and in light of the Treasurer's commitment on 18 August that there will be no further increases in taxes in this parliament, will he give a guarantee to the Australian public that the federal government will not increase taxes in order to pay for that compensation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2221" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In referring to the Prime Minister's comments last night, the questioner should also have mentioned that the Prime Minister said that this bill for Mabo compensation would accrue over many years&mdash;in fact, decades. In those circumstances, clearly the kinds of costs which were mentioned by the Prime Minister on that program, hundreds of millions of dollars, are not likely to be dumped on the budget in the course of the next year or so. This is something which will accumulate and, clearly, will have to be taken into account in formulating the budget in future years as we assess the size of that compensation bill. At this stage we clearly cannot foresee what the exact amounts will be in the next year or two or three, but we are clearly aware that there will be an accumulating bill to some degree. This is something we will take into account in future budget arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making our decisions on Mabo and making our decisions in relation to accepting the liability for compensation, we did so with our eyes wide open and with full recognition of the fact that this was a highly appropriate action for the Commonwealth to be taking and that it would be impossible in the circumstances to take any other approach such as to deny compensation. For instance, would the opposition want to impose the compensation on the owners of leases? That would obviously be extremely difficult and would cause enormous problems for industry. That would not be possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states will be liable to some degree for compensation bills accumulating in the future, but clearly the Commonwealth has to accept a substantial liability in all those circumstances. That is the best outcome for the nation, and the nation as a whole, through the Commonwealth budget, will have to pay that bill as it accumulates. But it is not something which will force an immediate major adjustment of the budget; it is something which will accumulate on the budget over ensuing years for the next decade or two.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Will the Attorney-General advise the House how the government's native title package will ensure the states maintain control of the land management system while ensuring that native title interests will not be compromised?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2221" SPEAKER="Lavarch The Hon M.H." NAMEID="LG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DICKSON" MINISTERIAL="ATTORNEY-GENERAL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Obviously the Commonwealth's approach to the High Court decision has always been based on two essential lines: primarily to achieve a just and fair outcome for the interests of Aboriginal and Islander people in Australia but, secondly, obviously to preserve the integrity and certainty of Australia's land management system. We have always recognised in that process that the states are the central land managers in our system of government. Accordingly, the Commonwealth has attempted to obtain basic agreement with the states as to those measures which are necessary to ensure that the states can legitimately maintain that role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the legislation will enable the states to validate those grants and interests which may have been rendered invalid by the existence of native title and the operation of any other law. Secondly, the states will be able to control the issue of grants of interest over native title land by establishing their own processes, provided that those processes meet the criteria set out in the Commonwealth's legislation. That is a very important point, of course, in that most of the debate has been about the economic use of land and how that would be determined. The Commonwealth's proposal will enable the states to maintain control over that process. That, of course, is the core of the land management issues which have been of concern to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that this does mark a very reasonable and commendable attitude on behalf of Aboriginal and Islander people to accept this part of the package, given that they do have&mdash;and I think with some justification&mdash;some concerns about bodies like mining wardens courts, given their past experience of such bodies. To come to a situation where they accept the states being able to maintain control over such a process is a major point in gaining agreement on this package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth will, of course, ensure that the interests of native titleholders are not compromised in the way in which the states act in this matter. To that extent, we will have to be satisfied by a state that it will have satisfactory procedures for notifying interested parties of proposals to make grants over land matters and make sure that native titleholders know what is going on. But there are provisions for bona fide negotiations with native titleholders. The hearings of objections by a recognised state tribunal will take account of a wide range of considerations, such as the effect of the proposed grant on the preservation of native title and its effect on native titleholders' way of life, protection of matters like sacred sites, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all, this is a good proposal which enables the states to maintain their proper role in land management, at the same time ensuring that the interests of native titleholders are maintained. I note that the package has been broadly welcomed by state leaders. Clearly, they want to see the detail, and that is understandable. But we have had positive statements, for instance, from the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, who made the very valid and correct point that this is an issue of such national importance that it should not be put in the corner of party political debate. He urged all Australians to look at it in that way. I certainly urge opposition members to adopt the advice of their Victorian state colleague.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Prime Minister seen reports of a National Australia Bank business survey on the Australian economy? Can he provide the House with an assessment of the survey? Will the signs of an emerging consensus on fiscal policy, Mabo and industrial relations increase confidence and support economic expansion?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2222" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member very much for the question. The National Australia Bank survey released yesterday shows further signs of a pick-up in the recovery. It was a large survey of 750 firms. It indicates a continuing positive trend in the September quarter, with a pick-up in trading conditions, export sales, profitability, employment, and forward orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The indication is that the improved business conditions were broadly based, consistent with the Australian Chamber of Manufactures survey yesterday. The NAB survey shows improved business conditions in all the mainland states and in almost all sectors, mining being the only exception. It also indicates that more firms hired additional labour in the September quarter than was expected. We have also seen other points of optimism. Yesterday we learnt that bond yields had fallen in response to a resolution of the budget impasse on a number of the major bills, closing at record lows for 10-year bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I know that we are still needing to bear the burden of the opposition's intransigence on these bills. The Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is, we took a principle position against four taxes. We stayed rock solid on that position. We were disappointed that in the end we didn't win.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems that it is the lot of the opposition leader to come second in all contests. We then had an interviewer putting to the shadow Treasurer that the opposition was still catching up; that the opposition had denied that it had been squeezed out of the decision making process. When asked whether he was pleased that the uncertainty had now been put aside, the shadow Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think, to be honest, uncertainty is ever a particularly good thing.</PARA>
<PARA>On another program, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone's sort of become over-budgeted, and there is clearly going to be some sense of relief that much of that is out of the way.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, much of their obfuscation has finally been overtaken by some good sense in the Senate. Decoding the sentence, that is what it means. I notice that today, on the same subject, the former Premier, Mr Greiner, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party, after its defeat, was in a mood for playing politics with everything. In the short term that might be a winner. In the long term I think it does great damage to the way the Liberal Party is perceived in the community at large.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It goes to the same point about the budget and the budget tactics. The article said this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One source said, `There was some consternation in the party room about the level of complacency and confidence about the party's position so soon after the election loss. It was a bit disillusioning'. `There's a feeling that we'll never learn', another said. One MP caused laughter when he pointed out that he'd heard the same optimistic presentation shortly after the 1990, 1987 and 1984 elections which the coalition had lost.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the same point as I made last week: the coalition is always easily pleased in defeat and always consoled in opposition. That adds a lot of cheer to the parliamentary process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude by saying that there is a recovery coming through now which is broadly based. One of the shadows hanging over it is the opposition's behaviour in the Senate. Even with that behaviour, the budget bills are being passed, bond yields are falling as a consequence, and the opposition is left marginalised and sidelined&mdash;just like the cartoon today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. Members of the opposition are like shags on a rock. They are sitting up above water level as the shags are handling their business with them, let me put it that way. Even the opposition's obstructionism will not be able to stop the recovery coming through.</PARA>

Of course, opposition members know full well that, in order to succeed, a native title claimant has, first, to satisfy the test established in the High Court&mdash;that is, the unbroken, continuing association of the claimant with the land in question&mdash;and, secondly, to prove that no inconsistent action of government has extinguished the title.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question, but I must say that responding to it gives me no pleasure. As the honourable member would know, the Commonwealth's commitment to schools in Victoria is second to none. This year the Commonwealth is spending over three-quarters of a billion dollars on school education in that state. That is an increase of 1.6 per cent in a tight budgetary environment. But schools&mdash;as the Victorian Minister for Education, Mr Hayward, is constantly telling us all&mdash;are primarily a state government responsibility. It is a responsibility that Mr Hayward appears intent on abrogating. At the same time as the Commonwealth is increasing its financial support to Victoria's schools, Mr Hayward appears to be intent on dismantling one of the best education systems in the country.</PARA></TALK.START>

In an interview in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> last month, the honourable member is on the record as wanting `more money spent on the early stages of education'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One would have to ask oneself: what is the basis of the concern and fear which the honourable member is suggesting? We have already had the position of Aboriginal and Islander people agreeing with the proposition that a validated lease will extinguish all native title in the pastoral lease. One would wonder whether Aboriginal and Islander leaders, having come to that conclusion about validated leases, would be rushing off to court trying to secure any sliver of rights which may remain in terms of valid positions. That is on the assumption that any such rights exist; whereas I think the balance of legal view is that, on the High Court decision, a valid issue of a leasehold has extinguished right. I have correspondence from the National Farmers Federation and it does not seem to have the same sort of concern about its position. Like most groups in society, it has come to the conclusion that the proposed legislation is a perfectly reasonable response to the Mabo case, and it does not see the difficulties which the honourable member has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that correspondence that I have received from the National Farmers Federation&mdash;if I recall it correctly&mdash;it says that its legal advice is that it thinks it is about a 99 per cent certainty that all valid pastoral lease has extinguished native title. I think the basis of the honourable member's question is totally fallacious. He is merely trying to whip up concern and fear in the Australian community, because those opposite are totally isolated on this issue. They are not supported by the National Farmers Federation or by the vast bulk of the mining industry. Certainly they will not be supported by Aboriginal and Islander people, and I do not believe they will be supported by fair-minded Australians.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. As he indicated in that question, I have been moving around Australia having extensive consultations with local government. At these consultations I have been discussing how reform of local government can be achieved by taking a more strategic and a more regional approach with larger and more efficient units of local government, supported by a population base and financial assets which can deliver efficiencies, structural reform and service delivery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be noted how the directions of reform that I have been discussing with local government differ markedly from recent announcements by both the Victorian and Western Australian governments of structural changes to the boundaries and functions of their capital cities. The importance of our capital cities as economic, social and cultural centres is clearly vital. Decisions about the management of our cities can therefore have national importance; indeed, they can have international significance. It is within this context that changes to the structure and management of the cities of Perth and Melbourne give rise to serious concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision by the Court government to carve up the inner city, creating a CBD council, fails to address the importance of a strategic approach to the management of the city. Sound management of cities involves not only the golden mile of central city blocks but also the management of infrastructure, transport, and land use planning on the city fringe, and gateways to the city. This decision would result in a disjointed approach to proper planning and management of the city of Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kennett government response to central city management has been to redraw boundaries in such a way that all of the city's economic, cultural and educational assets have been included in the one municipal council at the expense of residents. This decision directly contradicts the Victorian government's policy of repopulating the central city in inner ring suburbs. In fact, the population of the central city has been cut by one-third, traditional inner city communities have been cut by one-half and services to large public housing estates have effectively been placed in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are decisions about local government. They are decisions about particular councils; but they affect the strategic centre of two major Australian cities and they set important precedents. Essentially, these conservative governments are setting the precedent of one rule for the inner areas, particularly the central business district, and another rule for other councils. While these governments preach amalgamation and while they seek to group councils into larger units, through these areas of vested interests and central business districts they have effectively acted against the residents. While they talk about the need to bring people back into the cities and to give cities again a human face, effectively, they are separating residents from those cities and reversing a trend, which they tend to support in overall terms, of repopulating inner suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So these decisions by these two conservative governments certainly run against any conceptual basis, certainly run against their rhetoric, are detrimental to those cities and will have a very serious impact on the inner suburban residents who will now carry a much greater rate burden and will force councils into arbitrary amalgamations which will certainly not be in the interests of good local government or representative, sensible reform in this important sphere of government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Brisbane for his question and note in passing his chairing of a parliamentary inquiry which is looking at the broader issue of government purchasing. It is worth informing the House of the sheer magnitude of this issue, particularly in so far as it offers up very considerable opportunities for Australian business&mdash;small and medium size enterprises, most particularly. Each year the federal government alone purchases some $10 billion worth of goods and services. That figure is obviously dramatically increased when one takes into account the contribution of the state governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One manifestation of the federal government's approach to this issue is to ensure that Australian industry gets full and fair opportunity to participate against set criteria. Those criteria go to a range of policy objectives. There will be an opportunity in a little while to review how that process is working, particularly where devolution of purchasing authority has been a feature of the reorganisation of many departments and agencies. In this context there is an ongoing view in some parts of industry that purchasing officers are paying only lip-service to criteria other than price when they are making purchasing decisions and are maybe unfairly disadvantaging Australian companies. Last week, when I spoke at the Australian Chamber of Manufactures annual dinner, I indicated my support for putting Australian companies and workers first when `they have in terms of price, quality and associated issues earned that position'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another leg to this double of trying to ensure that Australian business gets plenty of opportunity to participate is the initiative of this government to try to move to a national network of industrial supplies offices, their purpose being to ensure that there is a sufficient flow of information to enable Australian companies to import replace by participating in opportunities as they arise. In that context, I regret to say that the Victorian ISO is engaging in what I consider to be petty rivalry. It is obstructing the move to a national network of industrial supplies offices. I have raised that matter with Premier Kennett in private discussion. Late last week I wrote to my counterpart industry ministers, including Mr Gude in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I observe that the industrial supplies office network offers a very real opportunity to enhance the ability of small and medium size enterprise to be part of, at the national government level, a $10 billion purchasing program of goods and services compounded by the state contribution and then swamped by the private sector's involvement in this area. At  federal government level, we want to see action taken to ensure that these petty rivalries, the attempt to prevent the national network from being established, are done away with and that we get on as joint partners in this issue to try to ensure that Australian business gets a fair crack of the whip.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the findings brought down by the coroner earlier in the week are consistent with those of the RAAF board of inquiry. The speculation that there was some sort of cover-up by the RAAF is unfounded. The full board of inquiry report was made available to the families of the crew and was provided to the coroner to assist in his deliberations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been some criticism of the manner in which the spouses were briefed by the RAAF immediately following the accident. The circumstances of this situation were somewhat unique in that three of the spouses were serving RAAF members at the time of the accident. They were therefore aware of the accident before official advice and briefing could be provided. While these circumstances are unfortunate, the record of the air force and the other services in the manner in which they deal with briefing next of kin in such circumstances is, on the whole, good.</PARA>

Criticism was also pointed at the inadequate research into the operating characteristics of the B707, the lack of adequate training and the need to preserve corporate knowledge. Arising from the board of inquiry, the RAAF has instigated full reviews of all operational documents relating to the B707 and all other RAAF transport aircraft. Some documents have already been published, with others approved and awaiting publication and some in final draft format.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corporate knowledge is being retained through the inclusion of relevant information in documents such as standard operating procedures and flying instructors manuals. Additionally, a written review of this accident is being prepared and action has been taken to create accident reviews on video to enhance the corporate memory and assist with accident prevention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coroner also recommended that the B707 flight simulator be upgraded to allow the VMCA, or minimum control airspeed, demonstrations to be conducted. In that regard the RAAF aims to issue a request for tender for the supply of a level five B707 simulator in early 1994. It should also be put on the record that the coroner, in concluding his report, stated:</PARA>

<PARA>Finally, I would like to address the issue of compensation. Payments to the dependants of the crew members under the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme were made within one month of the accident. If there are any further issues relating to compensation, they will be dealt with through the normal channels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Defence expresses his disappointment that the press has seemingly confused the causes of an accident with the blame for an accident.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Child care is an issue with which I have been greatly concerned ever since entering federal parliament. Many members here would be aware that I have spoken many times on this important issue in both the House of Representatives and in the Senate. Over the years it has been encouraging to see the growing recognition by members from both sides of politics of the importance of support for families through the provision of adequate child-care services and facilities. It is therefore ironic that in this Parliament House there is no provision for child care for the large number of staff who work sometimes horrendous hours here, much less for any members of parliament who may need such a service. The coalition recognised the need of working parents for adequate and affordable child care in Fightback. I quote a brief excerpt:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access to affordable child care is essential for working parents. With more women than ever before seeking to enter and remain in the paid workforce, it is particularly important to ensure that they are not inhibited from doing so by an inability to afford proper child care.</PARA>
<PARA>Our child-care policy statement of February 1993, `New Directions for Parents and their Children&mdash;Choice, Quality and Affordability', highlighted the coalition's longstanding view that for many families child-care expenses are a necessary cost of earning the family's income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), at the start of the 1993 federal election campaign, promised a package of new child-care measures worth $626.7 million over four years. The Childcare Rebate Bill implements this package, setting out the details of the rebate scheme, which will be available from July 1994, for parents using child care while in employment, training, studying or looking for work. The rebate will not be means tested. The coalition has a problem with that fact. The coalition will not oppose the bill but will move to amend it to cap the payment of the child-care rebate to remove the `child care for millionaires' element. The coalition also has a number of other concerns which I intend to raise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that we will move to amend this legislation if there is time. We are under the guillotine and this bill has to pass all stages by 5 o'clock this afternoon. So it is possible that we will not have time to move amendments here in the House of Representatives. If that is so, the same constraints will not apply in the Senate, and those amendments will be properly aired there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of concern which I think ought to be aired at this stage is privacy. Honourable members will recall that earlier this year the parliament passed the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1993, extending the role of the Health Insurance Commission and allowing it to plan the system by which cash rebates are to be paid. At that time, the coalition clearly stated its reservations, particularly concerning privacy. We warned the government that, depending on the final arrangements established by the HIC, it could not assume the support of the coalition for any subsequent legislation setting out details of the child-care rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our main concern then was that the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) had told the parliament that child-care providers would be required to supply their tax file numbers to the HIC. This would have meant that for the first time a government agency would hold both taxation and Medicare databases. The proposal was the subject of significant correspondence between the Privacy Commissioner and the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final arrangements have acknowledged the concerns raised initially by the coalition since the Childcare Rebate Bill does not require a child-care provider to supply a tax file number to the HIC. However, the bill does require child-care providers to register with the HIC as `registered carers' and state that they have a tax file number. In turn, the HIC provides the carer with a child-care provider number, which is to appear on receipts. However, the Commissioner of Taxation can request information on payments from the HIC under section 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Office of the Privacy Commissioner has indicated that its concerns have largely been addressed, some misgivings have been expressed on the further extension of use of the TFN and the fact that this bill moves away from voluntary disclosure of TFNs. I understand that the Australian Privacy Foundation has expressed a similar view. If it had not been for the coalition raising this matter in the first place, the government may not have backed down on its original proposal for use of TFNs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is the matter of equity. When the Prime Minister announced the rebate, the coalition rightly labelled it as child care for millionaires, which I have already mentioned. Two-income families with relatively high incomes will be the big winners. A survey by the Bureau of Statistics, published in 1990, found that only 6.9 per cent of families using child care spent more than $60 a week on it. Almost two-thirds of this group had enjoyed a weekly income of more than $800 per week, putting them in the top one-third of income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of those spending $100 or more per week on child care, 74 per cent had incomes greater than $800 a week. The rebate is worth most for those with child-care expenses of more than $110 per week for one child or more than $220 per week for two or more children. This means that most of those who will receive the maximum rebate are already relatively well off. However, under the coalition's proposed scheme, a rebate would not have been payable beyond a combined income of $60,000, with payment of the rebate tapering out between $50,000 and $60,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government argues that child care as a work related expense should not be means tested. While we agree that child care is properly regarded as a work related expense, it is still legitimate for the coalition to point out that the rebate is negatively targeted&mdash;that is, the higher the household income, the higher the payment&mdash;and thus is irresponsible given the economic imperatives confronting Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, another concern which the opposition would like to draw the government's attention to relates to the possibility of double-dipping. It would seem that in situations where a child is the dependant of more than one family it may be possible for the two families to collude and split child-care expenses, resulting in a total benefit for one child in excess of the maximum rebate. For example, if the child-care expenses for a child were $150 per week and one family were claiming the rebate, the maximum rebate would be $28.20. If the costs were split between two families, a rebate of $17.70 could be claimed by each family&mdash;a total rebate of $35.40. This is a matter which needs clarification, and one which the government should take special note of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the coalition sees problems with the government's move to establish a national accreditation scheme for child-care centres. The government, through regulations introduced into the parliament on 7 October 1993, is pursuing a wasteful and ineffective national accreditation system for the formal child-care sector and, at the same time, is encouraging the informal child-care sector through the child-care rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition considers that the compulsory system of accreditation is totally unnecessary and its link to eligibility for fee relief represents the beginning of a barely disguised attack on the private sector. Parents have not sought compulsory accreditation. It will do little or nothing for quality and will only add to child-care costs. And, let us face it, small businesses such as child-care centres do not need additional government schemes to administer and oversee. Already a number of child-care organisations have warned that this could penalise low income families and push children back into unsupervised backyard care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point the opposition seeks to make is that we have a situation where, at the same time as a flawed accreditation system is to be introduced for the formal sector, a child-care rebate will encourage the less regulated and, according to the government's own reasoning, poorer quality, informal sector. Fifthly and finally, the coalition has some reservations concerning the possibility of prosecution for making false or misleading statements. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has also raised concerns with provisions in the bill dealing with false or misleading statements used in connection with a claim for a rebate. The committee suggests that there may be an inappropriate onus of proof standard used in the bill. The coalition looks forward to hearing the government's response to the committee's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in my speech I mentioned that I would come back to the question of means testing the amount of income earned by families eligible for the child-care rebate. I point out that the coalition supports capping the level of income able to be earned in order to be eligible, as a way of recognising those in most need, that is, people on lower incomes and who are more likely to be experiencing increased financial pressure in Australia's present disastrous economic climate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years there has been increasing community recognition of the expense and the inequity of open-ended government assistance and the desirability of targeting those in most need. Failure to do so simply means that struggling, lower income families are required to subsidise high income, two-income families. The coalition believes that this approach would be an appalling misuse of scarce public resources and unnecessarily limits the capacity of government to provide adequate assistance to those in genuine need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under our policy, the Liberal and National parties propose that all parents who use child care could claim a generous 20 per cent cash rebate of up to $25 per child per week on the net costs incurred for child care, subject to a maximum combined parental income of $50,000 a year, and for those on incomes of $50,000 to $60,000 the rebate would be progressively withdrawn, with no rebate payable to those whose single or combined income exceeds $60,000. This approach recognises that, in the current economic climate, the country cannot afford to provide `child care for millionaires'. Therefore, the opposition would support an amendment to cap the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to touch briefly on the issue of access to child care by those parents who choose to remain at home during their children's formative years. The coalition fully supports the right of parents who are not in the paid work force to have access to child-care services for non-work related reasons, in order to enable them to have some relief from their domestic responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the Liberal and National parties are aware that many parents caring for children in the home feel that their contribution to effective child rearing and the extent of the career sacrifices which they have made are often not adequately recognised by the wider community. We believe that this issue really needs proper, careful investigation. Therefore, the issue of the role of government in relation to child care within the home should be referred to the Australian Institute of Family Studies for consideration and report. We also strongly believe that there should be improved access to respite child care for parents at home with children, including those living in the country and those with disabled children. Our policy includes initiatives in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning of my remarks, child care is a subject on which I have been speaking now for nearly two decades in this parliament. I am sure I can speak in a bipartisan sense to say that I welcome the developments that have taken place over the last two decades in the provision of child care in this country. Undoubtedly, one of the major reasons for the pressure to extend that child care has been the matter of single parent families. I would like to believe, however, that another major contributing factor is a more enlightened view on the issue of child care in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a subject, in my opinion, of fundamental importance to the structure of our society, dealing as it does with the welfare of our children&mdash;future generations of our nation. I would have liked to spend&mdash;and could have spent&mdash;much longer on the subject. However, I note there is a very long list of members on both sides of the parliament who wish to contribute to the debate. That, combined with the fact that I hope we may have a chance to look at some amendments in the committee stage, means that I have truncated my speech on this subject. I do, however, point out that there will be an opportunity for a longer debate in another place before the end of this parliamentary session. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the willingness of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) to cut short her speech and I will do likewise in order that other members will have an opportunity to speak. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Childcare Rebate Bill on behalf of the government. The child-care rebate was an election commitment, along with the home child-care allowance and the other measures in the child-care policy statement. The implementation of these child-care policies is a clear demonstration that child care is no longer a marginal issue. It has been placed firmly on the mainstream policy agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill clearly shows that the government recognises child care is no longer simply a welfare issue; no longer a women's issue alone. Child-care issues, including the availability of places, work based provision of care, cost of care, and quality of care, are industrial issues affecting all workers, all businesses and all industries. I take note of the honourable member's comments about the provision of child-care facilities in this place. I commend the Speaker, who is not in the House at the moment, for taking steps to rectify that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not to say that the government does not recognise that the issue of child care is of greater importance to women. This bill, accompanied as it is by a comprehensive child-care policy, will greatly benefit Australian working women. My point is that it is one of the first steps towards a time when we can stand up in this place and proudly say that there are no women's issues; there are only people's issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may not happen in my time, or even in the time of the next generation of members, but it will come. Future generations of Australians will look back to these times with puzzlement. They will read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and ask themselves why it was necessary for women parliamentarians in their first speeches in 1993 to speak, without exception, of their role in this place as women members. They will look at these times of great achievement for women in much the same way that we look back to the time before universal suffrage. Those future Australians will look at the program of this government and recognise the significant contributions made towards the equality they will enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The participation of women in the work force will continue to increase. Women are becoming more and more integrated into Australia's economic life. The Labor government has always recognised that women are unable to participate fully in the work force without access to affordable child care. In the term of this government, the supply of government supported child-care places has expanded more than fourfold from 46,000 places in 1983 to almost 208,000 places in June 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child care has become more affordable, especially for low and middle income earners. The government's child-care assistance scheme, formerly fee relief, now helps two-thirds of families using Commonwealth funded child-care centres. Child-care policy is an integral part of the government's approach to building a highly skilled and adaptable work force. The range of child-care measures, of which this bill is one, is designed to continue this government's proud record in providing appropriate and affordable child-care places. They are designed to give parents choices about the way they combine work and family responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cash rebate scheme expands the objectives of the children's services program to provide the following: recognition that the costs of child-care arrangements are a legitimate work-related expense, assistance to families who make the choice to use informal care or who are unable to get access to formal care, assistance to working families who are ineligible for targeted child-care assistance, and additional assistance to those who do receive child-care assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rebate will be available for child-care expenses for children up to and including 12 years of age for families where both parents are engaged in full- or part-time work outside the home, or who are studying, training or looking for work. In the case of sole parent families, the criteria need only apply to the custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eligible child care under the scheme will include all work-related formal and informal child care, provided that the carers are 18 years or over. The maximum weekly rebate will be $28.20 per week for one child and $61.20 per week for two or more children. It is important to note that the amount payable under this scheme is paid over and above child-care assistance. An estimated 230,000 families with 358,000 children will benefit from the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, 54.9 per cent of families have both partners in the work force; 42.7 per cent of women are in the labour force; and over nine per cent of families are sole parent families. Nearly 10 per cent of children aged zero to four years in Macquarie come from two parent families with both parents working full time or from sole parent families with the custodial parent employed full time. These figures do not take into account children aged five to 12, families where one or both parents are studying, engaged in part-time work or looking for work. Yet even on these limited figures, it is clear that the introduction of the child-care rebate will be of great benefit to my constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been made in this place and in the media of the opposition's objections to this bill. The opposition had the cheek to compare the child-care rebate we have introduced with the system it proposed during the election campaign. The coalition's proposal would have been about $30 million cheaper. That was its only advantage. It would have cost about $6 million just to administer the means test to the 230,000 families eligible to apply. It would have excluded about 30,000 families from the scheme altogether, and would have reduced the rebate to a further 20,000 middle income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, the government's policy clearly equates child care with other expenses associated with earning an income, which are not means tested. As I have already said, this is important if we are to see child care as an industrial issue rather than a women's issue. It has also been suggested that it would be preferable for child care to be a tax deduction. It would be preferable&mdash;for high income earners. Low income earners would get no benefit whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The child-care rebate scheme also has the added advantage of being claimable as the expense is incurred instead of up to 18 months later, as is the case with the tax concession. It is also available for those who are studying and looking for work, which is not the case with tax concessions. This is consistent with other concessions, such as the new home child-care allowance. The honourable member for Moncrieff referred to those women who stay at home, and the government has taken steps to care for them. The home child-care allowance will be paid every fortnight directly to the non-earning parent. Families whose tax liability was previously too low to get the full value of the dependent spouse rebate will receive greater assistance from this allowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to highlight the extraordinary lengths to which this government will go to bring our great country to its knees. That may sound a bit dramatic in the context of this very important issue, but it should be very clearly stated that the Childcare Rebate Bill is ill conceived and will create more problems than it will solve for the working parent and families. Why has the government brought on this particular bill? Why does the government choose to discriminate against Australian families who contribute to the future of our great country?  Why should the government choose to burden the entire community with an issue that, on the surface, does not highlight the deeper ingrained problems it will develop?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is devoid of positive solutions to the ever increasing problems of our community and of this bill. Although beneficial to some of our community, it does not address the fundamental issues underlying many problems experienced by modern Australian families. The normal socialist attitude to problem solving is simply to throw money at it; if that fails, throw more money at it; and, if the problem continues to occur, simply ignore it. The government throws money at a problem which may be better handled without government involvement or intervention. This is a particular issue that the government has chosen to throw money at. The government's motive is simple. In this legislation, the government is attempting to satisfy an election promise that was ill conceived and made in an effort to appease certain community interests. It is typical of this government's attitude of policy on the run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some could argue that the government's crass attempt at vote buying may have worked. The child-care rebate legislation, as detailed in the Childcare Rebate Bill, is fundamentally wrong for a number of reasons. I will highlight some of the more significant areas of contention. It is argued at this point of economic decay that it is irresponsible of government to spend taxpayers' money on issues that do not primarily address some of our country's most fundamental problems&mdash;namely, unemployment and poor economic productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government indicated in February 1993 that it would spend $626 million over four years on the allowance. We are informed that the problem will cost $151 million in 1994-95, with an administration cost of approximately 10 per cent&mdash;but it is estimated to cost more than this. Firstly, we do not need to increase our administrative costs so much when we have systems already in place. Secondly, the bill discriminates. While providing for all those income earners, it neglects the essence of our stable community&mdash;namely, those child carers who stay at home to provide care and attention to their children. Thirdly, the legislation does not address some of our more fundamental social problems and, instead, may promote division and resentment amongst many Australian families. Finally, it provides no incentive to those ultimately responsible for children&mdash;parents&mdash;to maintain links with their families and provide for a future based on  responsibility and not dependency upon the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To appreciate the true perspective for the introduction of this bill we must look at some of the current problems befalling families and some of the history associated with this socialist driven government. Before doing so, honourable members must remember the following famous quote from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 17 March 1970, St Patrick's Day:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Husbands have been forced to send their wives to work in order to provide the necessities of life. Young mothers have been forced out of their homes by economic pressure. We must not forget that this government has been in office for 20 years. It has had the duty and the opportunity to rectify the present situation. Family life is the very basis of our nationhood. In the last couple of years the government has boasted about the increasing number of women in the workforce. Rather than something to be proud of, I feel that it is something of which we should be ashamed.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder whether his attitude has changed? I do not think so. Let us look at the record of the misguided compassion and irresponsibility of the Australian Labor Party when it comes to helping average Australian families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Fisher says, I bet the Labor Party would find someone else to blame rather than correctly accept some responsibility for the difficulties that Australian families have endured. We must acknowledge that in the last 20 years Labor has governed for over 13 of them. The basic problem of this legislation&mdash;it is typical of Labor Party doctrine&mdash;is lack of responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of family breakdowns is central to this legislation and the lack of responsibility which has come to characterise Labor Party doctrine can be found in this legislation. Why is there a demand for legislation of this type anyway? Primarily, the legislation sets out to help those parents who work and are trying to provide for their children by increasing their family income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to identify a number of obvious difficulties in the present legislation as presented, and they are consistent with other actions by this Labor government, which seeks to impose greater burdens on low to middle income Australians while leaving more wealthy Australians relatively unscathed in these times of restraint. The obvious difficulty with the present legislation is the effect it has on income redistribution. As a result of the child-care rebate not being means tested&mdash;that is, cash rebates are paid to eligible parents irrespective of income or family wealth&mdash;there is a broad brush approach to assisting families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pressure on families to accumulate material wealth is tremendous these days. Community demands require parents to keep up their living standards materialistically, and we now have a community so passionate about material wealth that we are beginning to ignore the priority of our lives, which, simply put, is our families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Communities around the world do not place as much emphasis as we do on material wealth but they do place a huge priority on the welfare of the family, both immediate and extended. It is a pity that the government does not encourage the acceptance of these family values as readily as it accepts other cultural issues for our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Labor Party has been in power we have had huge reductions in real wage levels; in other words, we are earning less for the same amount of work. This is no fault of the employer for he has no control over taxes and prices of commodities such as food and clothing. In fact, actual wages have increased but the silent taxes the government introduces have reduced the spending power of Australian families. That will also be extended by the latest budget of betrayal with the one per cent increase in wholesale sales tax. Therefore there is a greater demand on Australian families for both parents to work in order to maintain a reasonable standard of living which is equivalent to what they were earning 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Couple this pressure with the feminist push which undermines and grossly devalues the role and importance of motherhood, and we see evidence where women who choose to raise their families are looked upon as not pulling their weight, as living a secondary and demeaning lifestyle. There is nothing corrupt or devalued in wanting to care for your own children, yet this legislation promotes just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Becoming a parent is an awesome responsibility. One should not take this step lightly because it is about sacrifice&mdash;the biggest sacrifice being to give up one's own individuality and independence in return for the care and attention of one's own children. Although we remain the makers of our own destiny, we must never neglect the responsibility of the lives of our own children. The notion of children being an option to our lives, where we take them and care for them on our own terms, is repugnant to me, as I am sure it is to many within the community. The idea of using children to fulfil the emotional gaps in our lives on a part-time basis whilst we are out conquering the world is quite bizarre and detrimental to the development of our children. Yet this legislation promotes such an idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is wrong with remaining responsible to our children, to take their lives into our own hands&mdash;the hands of parents&mdash;rather than seeking help and financial support from the government to raise them? Let us review the child-care legislation proposed by the Labor Party. The very fact that it is planned to have the rebate available through the Department of Health opens up a myriad of problems, mostly administrative. Why would one want to embark on a welfare payment scheme through a department that is not structured to deal with it when there already is in place the Department of Social Security with systems in place to handle programs such as the family allowance? The major cost of this legislation&mdash;some 10 per cent&mdash;will be in administering it through a department that has previously had no experience in welfare details. We will have the potential for an administrative nightmare. Other family payments are made through the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon reading the legislation, a number of discriminatory clauses appear, and I ask the minister to reconsider the potential damage to the community that these practices may develop. Firstly, the legislation discriminates against those parents that plan their finances and their family well enough to provide for a carer parent to remain at home. Secondly, it discriminates against those within our community who are low income earners by not capping the eligibility of the rebate. In other words, a couple who are currently providing child-care arrangements and meeting them financially, can have unlimited income and remain eligible for the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation aims to provide support to those least likely to be able to afford child care, and therefore discriminates against low income families. The legislation provides for overseas students to claim, and therefore discriminates against Australian taxpayers who are asked to support non-Australian citizens. It also discriminates against carers, in particular the teenager who is out to earn some extra money to help maintain a standard of living. For parents to be eligible for the rebate, the legislation requires that they must use registered child-care providers. The legislation is weak and badly thought out. It will increase division within the community. The only recognisable result from the legislation is increasing costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division in the community seems to be the catchcry of the Labor Party. This government has not surprised anyone with its poor handling of major issues such as unemployment, the republic, the Mabo debate, and also industrial relations. We have a position in Australia right now of the new haves and have-nots&mdash;those that qualify for social welfare and those that do not. The dreadful aspect of this is that those receiving the benefits may be in a better position to those that are not. It is therefore time to analyse what we are doing in welfare and whether we are reaching those most in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To highlight the haves and the have-nots in this case, working parents can qualify for up to $61.20 a week whilst those that do not work and prefer to care for their children, and arguably provide a more secure environment for their children, do not qualify. The government would argue that the introduction of the home care allowance makes up for this, but it is already provided for as the dependent spouse rebate. There is no incentive to provide a caring environment; rather, there is an incentive to drop parental responsibility and give up the role of carer for one of financial provider. This government sees nothing wrong with that uncaring and grotesque form of socialism. The collective is more important than the individual; that is its motto, and it is working to the detriment of our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if the problem of child care is an issue for working parents&mdash;as I am sure it is&mdash;and they are in extreme need of financial assistance, why not consider some alternatives? For instance, why not encourage employers to provide child care for the children of their employees? This will result in fewer hassles for the employee, provide a more stable staff relationship, lead to less time spent in down time due to child-care problems, and it could be an attractive benefit to attract employees to the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the government would need to repeal FBT requirements and perhaps provide other employer incentives; but this action motivates the community to look for solutions rather than let the government take control. Why not provide PAYE tax benefits for child-care rebates rather than require people to apply through second and third person systems? This would reduce administration costs. It would also reduce potential rorting opportunities. Why does the government not consider the tax system of the household rather than a straight PAYE schedule? In other words, recognise the coalition idea of split family income to recognise the importance of the parent who cares at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, parenting is not the responsibility of the government and the Australian taxpayer. It is the responsibility of those who choose to become parents and those who do must never choose to walk away from that responsibility. Ultimately, if we continue down this socialist track we will institutionalise our families to an extent where we consider them part time and the government will control their destiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the government to review this legislation; to rethink the administration of it; to address the discrimination aspects of it; to find incentives to encourage the business community to provide the care for its staff rather than the government, for ultimately it affects them to a greater extent; and, very importantly, to recognise more fully the role played by mothers in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our community values are under threat from this government and I comprehensively support the need to care for our children&mdash;our nation's future. Rather than rely on government action, we should promote community solutions. </PARA>

Child-care expenses incurred in formal child care&mdash;long day care services, family day care, outside school hours care&mdash;and informal care arrangements, relatives and nannies, will be eligible for the rebate. Child-care expenses incurred in informal care have been included in recognition of the fact that almost two-thirds of working families use informal care either by choice or because formal care is not available. </PARA>

I am pleased to point out, particularly to the last speaker, the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans), the differences in both policy and reality between the major parties on child care at the last election. I was happy to stand for the Labor Party's record against the coalition's basket of woe. For the benefit of those coalition members who are here, I will quote an article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 16 September 1992 that described the coalition's proposed tax system at the last federal election. It stated:</PARA>

I also believe that both parents, if they so wish, should be able to add their contribution to the work force and utilise their talents and abilities to the best effect in that regard, provided, of course, that in that process their children are adequately protected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what is of great concern in this community of ours is the ever-growing number of mothers who are forced into employment, often for a pittance, merely to be able to give their children the bare necessities of life&mdash;food and clothing. This sad situation is a reflection of the growing gap between the rich and the poor evidenced since Labor has held office over the last decade. This was highlighted in the coalition's provision of family services paper, from which I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1982-83 the income of the top one per cent of income earners equalled the total earnings of the bottom 11 per cent. By 1988-89 the top one per cent were earning an amount equal to the total incomes of the bottom 21 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>That really is a terrible indictment of Labor's stewardship of this nation over the last decade. Child-care rebates may seem necessary at the present time to allow many adult members of our community to fulfil their responsibilities to their families' material welfare. However, there is an alternative which would, in my opinion, provide a far better way of caring for children and generally stabilising our extremely sick society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer here to something which is not new: a tax concession as opposed to a child-care rebate which, with certain other measures, would help to reverse the unfortunate trend in our society towards family breakdown, divorce and a general destabilisation of family life. In an address to the Lyons Forum in this Parliament House on 7 October this year, Mr Barry Maley, senior fellow of the Centre for Independent Studies, when referring to his book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Marriage, divorce and family justice</EMPHASIS>, published this year, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seven out of ten Australians nominate family life as the source of their greatest satisfaction&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and yet&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether by design or unintended consequence, that process&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the decomposition of the family&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is well advanced in this country. The melancholy social and moral consequences are all about us.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Maley suggests, and most of us would agree, that a greater respect for traditional marriage and family is necessary. However, following on from that, and relating to the substance of this Childcare Rebate Bill, Mr Maley mentioned alternative taxation arrangements as an important instrument to help to cure the present ills of our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members in this place would know, a massive $40 billion is being spent annually in Australia in social security payments. This is 35 per cent of the total federal outlays and takes far more away from families in tax than is actually returned to them in benefits. Barry Maley asserts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The central economic focus of family policy must be tax cuts based on family status, together with equitable childcare provision, both for those who want to work and those who want to stay at home.</PARA>
<PARA>The importance of family cannot be overestimated. It was restated by the Liberal and National coalition in its family services paper when it was said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The place of the community and family are central to Liberal philosophy founded on the freedom of the individual.</PARA>
<PARA>The Parliamentary Secretary's statement that child care is no longer a welfare issue but an economic issue is put into focus by certain statistics brought out in the coalition's family services paper. I quote certain of those statistics: the divorce rate has tripled in this generation; 800,000 children live in homes where no-one has a job; and half a million children live with only one parent, many of them receiving some kind of social security payment, including child-care allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 400,000 sole parents, of whom 90 per cent are women&mdash;and most of those are on state pensions. Some 60 per cent of natural fathers of those families make no contribution to the upkeep of their children. Around 25 per cent of births are ex-marital and 47,000 children per year see their parents divorce. That is a quite appalling set of statistics and a terrible indictment of the government of this country over the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I support the concept of children being afforded adequate care while parents work, the previous statistics really show that there must be a better way, a different and more positive way, to advance security in Australian society. The answer must be in part a change in philosophy to ensure that the present generation of children is given the stability of background that many of their older brothers, sisters and associates have been denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary has stipulated that day care centres, preschools, family day care, outside school hours care, vacation care and private child-care arrangements will be eligible for the rebate. But these measures, generous as they may seem, only skim the surface of the real problem. Barry Maley summed it up well when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decay of the stable two-parent family entails very substantial social costs in more crime, more delinquency, more violence, more drug-taking, more suicide, more child abuse, more poverty.</PARA>
<PARA>The remedies for this tragic situation are not easy. However, there are two very practical and important areas that can, with foresight and determination, be addressed&mdash;taxation and employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly wish to spend some time on the first area, taxation. Barry Maley suggests that to bolster the fading fortunes of the family every dependent child under 16 should receive either a tax credit or a cash benefit worth $2,000 per annum. He estimates that this would cost $8 billion to $9 billion for the four million plus children under 16. The figure would be almost entirely offset by the elimination of the dependent spouse rebate, the basic family payment, all child-care subsidies and a portion of the sole parent pension&mdash;particularly as the child support scheme for separated parents takes effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Maley estimates that this would save $8 billion and there would be additional savings by transferring a large part of the administration to the Australian Taxation Office. There is time to make only the briefest mention of the huge problem of unemployment, but it is a further factor that adds to the great stress on the family today. In conclusion, I will quote from a letter sent to members of this House by the wife of a man recently made unemployed. Her net income of $700 per fortnight disqualified her from any kind of financial support for herself, her unemployed husband and her two teenage children. She writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the alternative. Sell the great Australian dream, break up the family, get divorced, then we will all qualify for job search allowance, rental assistance, health card.

Child care is now seen by most people in Australia as an important right&mdash;and every family should have access to it. I remember when child care was looked on purely as a marginal welfare issue. Women who lived in isolated areas with no family support system had no opportunity to improve the quality of their lives. They were not able to attend classes to improve their skills, to visit essential services such as doctors or dentists or to assist their community in many of the unpaid roles women take on. Nor could they get relief from the task of looking after children 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a full-time job, particularly when the children are young, and it can be extremely stressful at times. No-one in the traditional work force would accept working conditions such as these, nor should we expect our carers of future generations to do so. Access to child care plays an important role in the welfare of people. It is now more than that. It is no longer just a welfare issue; it is an important economic issue and part of the government's approach to building a highly skilled and adaptable work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who have responsibility for looking after future generations must have access to affordable child care if they are to participate actively in the work force. It is not only confined to women; many men are now taking up the responsibility of primary care for their children. This gives all primary carers a choice as to how much quality time they spend with their children yet also be able to participate in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has made child care a priority. When elected in 1983 there were just 46,000 operational child-care places. Now we see 208,000 child-care places in Australia. The allocation of funds in this budget will lift the number to around 237,000 by the end of this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the place numbers have grown, the government has ensured that ordinary Australian families can afford to use child-care facilities. As part of this whole discussion, it has been important to ensure that quality of child care is the best. I am particularly interested in this area, and it is to be noted that part of the registration of child-care providers is to ensure that centres have some sort of accreditation before they are eligible to receive child-care assistance. I received a letter from Community Child Care in Victoria, which informed me that it supports strongly an accreditation system that links child-care assistance to child-care centres in receipt of public funds. I support its concerns that that be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a requirement that existing centres wishing to continue to be eligible to receive child-care assistance, formerly fee relief, on behalf of parents will have until 30 June 1994 to register their intention to participate in the quality improvement and accreditation system with the National Child Care Accreditation Council. Setting up the new quality improvement and accreditation system and linking it to child-care assistance will ensure the provision of quality care in Commonwealth funded child-care centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quality child care is about well-trained carers who understand that there is a need to stimulate children in care in active and positive ways.

There is a great difference between caring for children and minding children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Studies have shown that children from stimulated early environments are better prepared and more able to move into a formal learning situation that school provides. It also gives parents peace of mind that their child is being cared for in the best possible way and that there is some form of accountability from child-care centres to ensure that their workers are trained to provide this care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will mean that interaction will need to take place between staff, children and parents who support the services and staff development.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Childcare Rebate Bill, there are a few things I want to mention, particularly with regard to the matter of equity. I had the earlier connection of being shadow minister for child care at a time when the industry, particularly in the public sector, because of the massive regulation that had interfered with its running, particularly in Victoria, and the qualifications laid down by the authorities on those who could run child-care centres, was almost phasing itself out of the reach of people who had a need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all need to realise that children are a very precious commodity and they have to be in the hands of somebody who is experienced. But there was the ridiculous situation where the price for child-care services was pushed right out of proportion yet private child-care centres were not being allowed to participate in any Commonwealth programs but were subject to the same regulation. This was ridiculous to the extent that on several occasions people who owned a child-care centre and had an empathy well in keeping with the enterprise they were running were disfranchised for actually running their own child-care centres. I believe that is where regulation goes too far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to speak also, as I said earlier, on the lack of equity. I appreciate that the government is saying this is not a welfare bill. It is related to the economic wellbeing in that child-care expenses should be regarded as a tax deduction or a deductible item in the earning of assessable income. The interesting thing is that once we do that we remove all limits as far as income testing is concerned. The second reading speech makes it quite evident that a person way up the ladder on a high income can still get benefit up to a maximum weekly rebate of $28.20 per week. As somebody in my electorate mentioned to me, it was obviously framed by somebody in the Public Service in Canberra, where those types of incomes are available on a double income basis&mdash;not by people in the back of my electorate, where two people strive on farming enterprises earning nothing and still having to be responsible for the wellbeing of their child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I relate to this an earlier decision on Austudy made through the budget process. Quite a few months ago I went to the west of my electorate to a cattle area that has been suffering three years of drought. The conditions on those properties are dismal and the prospects are just as dismal. I visited a house where the father and mother had been up at first light attending to their duties on the property. There was no division made between their work responsibilities. At 9 o'clock the wife came back to the house and from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock, with one child in tow, she was trying to teach the other three children through distance education. She was not trained for that, but that was one of her tasks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage she thought that with the assistance of distance allowances and other facilities such as Austudy they could get their children into boarding schools, closer to the city. The changes to Austudy eligibility have meant that the prospects of those people being able to get a Commonwealth subsidy when they have no income of their own to send their children to these institutions is very bleak indeed, as we must remember again that they have to contribute part of their cash outflow to make it possible in any case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard of cases where children have voluntarily come out of school because they feel guilty about not helping their parents on the property. The point I make is that this child care is available in a fairly well-defined amount to people on dual incomes with a heck of a lot of income to provide the basis to bring up a child. Education is as vital to bringing up a child as is child care, and this suggests that parents are excluded from claiming the cost of caring for their own children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The example I just gave honourable members is of a working parent who is obliged to educate and look after her children while people in heavily populated places can get the benefit of the allowance irrespective of their income. These people who are struggling on a nil income are being denied benefits for the upbringing of their children, for education and things like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must confess that I am somewhat alarmed at the administrative costs associated with this whole arrangement. A program with administrative costs of 10 per cent is one that we should look at very carefully. It also suggests to me that, because of accreditation and many other things, the expense involved in administration is going to lead to a confused system. We have talked about accreditation and administrative costs. Certainly, people are moving into the area of child care. I know that the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) has had a long-term concern about this matter. I often wonder whether the money that we spend and the programs that we come up with are appropriate in all the circumstances and, more particularly, whether they are fair and equitable to all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, about four years ago during my time as shadow minister with responsibility for child care, an area in which I found a definite lack of equity was the lack of private carers available to participate along with the public sector. I found that public sector child care was being used as a political ploy in some electorates. While I note that a lot has been done to remove that inequity, there is still inequity in the area that I mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer particularly to my electorate of Dawson. While these child-care facilities will be available within both the city and country areas of my electorate, there is still a large disparity in the ability to cater for different needs. I refer particularly to Airlie Beach, which is a fast growing, very tourist oriented area, in which mums and dads do work together in order to earn money for the economic benefit of the whole family. There are not enough child-care places available in that area. It has obviously been deliberately avoided by the authorities, particularly at the state level. I have had many representations in this regard. I have written to the ministers concerned, including the federal minister with responsibility for this area, and at this stage there has been no response. The interesting point is that what people are looking for is more child-care places. There are unlimited numbers of people who are prepared to do the caring, either at home or in the child-care centres, yet the required approval to provide the places has not been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we can talk about the costs associated with the provisions of this bill, I think we should be talking about equity, particularly in relation to farming families, who are not getting their fair share of taxpayers'dollars in order to provide for the appropriate care of children in their formative years, within both the education system and the social system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have nothing more to say in this regard. I support the amendments that will be moved by the opposition at the committee stage. I ask the House to consider the small minority of people around Australia&mdash;be they in Western Australia, in my electorate or elsewhere&mdash;who are struggling to do the best they can to raise their children in a family environment and who have been denied assistance at this time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me begin by addressing some of the general points made by opposition members. They tried to suggest that the government is not concerned about families, that its general approach has not been family oriented. Nothing could be further from the truth, particularly when one looks at this bill. As I said in my second reading speech, this is historic legislation. For the first time the federal parliament is actually legislating to help to provide direct assistance for child care for all sectors. Even when there are informal arrangements in place, people will be able to get a rebate for child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extraordinary that opposition members who spoke in the debate&mdash;with the exception of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who has carriage of the matter on behalf of the opposition&mdash;seemed to be opposed to the bill. Having listened to them, one would think they were not in favour of these historic changes. Let me just go over what is involved here. We had a commitment by the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during the election that this scheme would be put in place. That commitment is being honoured in full. It will help nearly a quarter of a million families. Also, the way in which the scheme has been structured is such that it supplements other programs that are intended to assist in the area of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are talking about social justice, it is extraordinary that some members of the opposition implied that the Labor Party was not concerned about social justice, the poor or with assisting ordinary Australian families.

By paying the rebate through the Medicare office the rebate will be much easier to administer because every Australian has a Medicare card. It will be very easy to put the administrative system in place. In fact, we will not have to put a new administrative system in place because an administrative system already exists with Medicare. We are really developing the Medicare system to incorporate this other measure. Therefore the honourable member was completely mistaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security deals with one, two or three different categories of people, but it does not deal with those who are working parents. They would have to be enrolled into the Department of Social Security. The suggestion by the honourable member for Moncrieff is foolish, because it would actually involve much more administrative costs than would the system that we are putting into place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the question of how this proposal will work with respect to the privacy provisions. As the honourable member for Moncrieff outlined, and as I outlined in the second reading speech, it is important for us to get this matter very clear so no-one is in doubt about where the rebate can be claimed. When parents want to claim the rebate, they will be able to claim it from a Medicare office. They will need to produce a receipt. That receipt will have on it a number. That number will be for a person who has been registered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that persons will have to do in order to be registered is to state that they have a tax file number. They do not have to give the tax file number to anyone. The tax file number will not become available to the department of health, to Medicare officers or to anyone else. Carers simply have to make a statement that they have a tax file number. That means maximum protection. So the concerns that were raised by the opposition have been met in the new arrangement. There will be no access to people's tax file numbers through this system. Given that, the concerns of the Privacy Commissioner have mostly been met. Therefore, I hope that puts to rest that problem and resolves what was formerly going to be a big stumbling block with respect to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the question raised by the honourable member for Moncrieff about the amendments to be moved by the opposition. Basically, they are saying that, somehow or other, this legislation should be means tested; that it is not correct to give the child-care rebate to everyone. The principle of universality is not to apply in this case, according to the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the problems associated with this course? First of all, it is not the usual practice for rebates to be means tested. So the opposition's desire to means test rebates is achieved by suggesting a different approach to the whole question of rebates than we have had in other areas of legislation. There is also the question of how we would actually do this. The opposition has suggested that we are giving child-care rebates to millionaires. It wants a cut-off point of $60,000&mdash;or is it $50,000?&mdash;in its amendments. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments are to put into effect the principle that I referred to in the second reading debate. All the amendments deal with the point that I raised relating to the means testing of the child-care rebate. The amendments would mean that the rebate would start to phase out when a family's income&mdash;for example, in a two-parent situation&mdash;reached $50,000 and would be cut out altogether when it reached $60,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter gives me the opportunity to respond to a point that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) made in his second reading reply. He said that the opposition's amendments would attack the principle of universality. As far as I can remember, his words were that it was not the practice, in nearly all cases, to means test rebates. However, there are rebates that are means tested. The first one that popped into my mind, probably because of the debate that is under way, was the dependent spouse rebate. That rebate is means tested according to the income of the person claiming the rebate. There may well be other instances. I do not think I really need go any further because that rebate is highly relevant to this issue being deleted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I freely admit to being someone who, in the last 20 years, has gone on the record as saying that I do not think that in all cases a dependent spouse rebate is necessarily justified. I would have liked to have seen a limit applied to the rebate being paid in the cases of families without dependent children. The rebate should have to be justified. Be that as it may, that is not the law. The dependent spouse rebate is about to be phased out altogether by the government. I raise the subject not to debate the rights and wrongs of the dependent spouse rebate but to say that the intent of the dependent spouse rebate was, and always has been, to give some financial support to the family where one parent goes out to work and the other one remains at home full time in order to look after children. Nearly all of the debate about the worth of the dependent spouse rebate has been cast in the context that a family with one parent remaining at home in order to undertake the full-time parenting role with children should receive&mdash;following that model&mdash;financial support from the community courtesy of the taxpayer. That is a very important issue in the context of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support child care. My colleagues that the parliamentary secretary chose to refer to as the New Right were trying to point out that we should not try to push everyone into this mould. I have been one who, for a long time&mdash;going back 20 years when words basically fell on ears that could have done with a little assistance&mdash;has believed in the principle of choice; people ought to have the right of choice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know. I point out that what I have been saying over the last 20 years is consistent with what I am saying now. Lest anyone suggest that maybe I have wavered a little in my line, I am just making it a little clearer. Twenty years ago we had to hammer on the doors of industry and say, `Women have a right to work if that is their choice'. I, of all people, am acutely aware that many women in the community were very worried about people like me going around trying to hammer on those doors because they thought we were trying to put them into yet another situation of no choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no more valid to say that mothers must stay at home and look after their children and that they are neglecting their children if they go into the paid work force, than it is to say that the mother who stays at home and looks after children full time is not working. There is a real worry&mdash;and it is a worry I understand and share&mdash;that the person who is paid by somebody outside the family to rear children is doing professional work, yet the person who is of that family doing the same job is not doing professional work. I would like to see a rather more than just lip-service given to that principle. It is therefore right that the opposition in this debate has raised the issue of support for the parent at home full time in a situation where the family and the individuals involved think that that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I listened to this debate, that is the point that my colleagues on the opposition side were making. The fact that they were men does not mean that they were taking a male chauvinist view at all. The fact is that they happen to be the people on the speaker's list. I support their right and agree with them that that situation must be defended. I do not know a mother who would ever move to the point of view that the woman who chooses not to go into the paid work force is doing any less a professional job and should receive any less recognition than the woman who moves into the work force. The person who then looks after those children at home receives professional recognition. Lip-service is not good enough. Women are fed up with being patted on the back, or even patronisingly on the head, and being told, `You are doing a wonderful job staying at home and looking after your children but, by golly, don't look to the taxpayer'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been the coalition's policy for a long time that the expenses of child care ought to receive a taxation rebate&mdash;since well before the 1993 election. We have gone to more than one election with that policy. The Labor Party is a latter-day convert to it. I was quite startled when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made the statement prior to the election campaign that, finally, the Labor Party was going to acknowledge the principle that the cost of child care can be a very legitimate cost of going to work. There is a very eloquent statement by the minister in this bill's second reading speech to that effect, so I will not repeat the words. I suggest that the parliamentary secretary read that second reading speech and he will see all the right words. However, we could also go back and look at some of the speeches, articles and press statements made by the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) prior to this becoming the Labor Party's policy. She has often dealt with why it would be a matter of great inequity for child-care expenses to be a tax deduction. She took great pains to promote the view it would be inequitable. Her words are there for all to see. The Labor Party is very much a latter-day convert to this principle. I would not have made that point if it had not been for the fact that the parliamentary secretary sought to cast the opposition, quite falsely, in the opposite position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, because time has nearly expired on this set of amendments, I want to underline something that I said during the second reading debate and which I shall repeat for the parliamentary secretary's benefit. This bill is being changed by the government&mdash;I will come back to this matter again when the parliamentary secretary moves on to his amendment&mdash;because the opposition raised an issue. I think it is a great pity that debates come to this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to what some of the government members have said when they were attacking the opposition. There were really no grounds for attack. We have a difference about whether or not something should be means tested, but no difference about the central substance and importance of the issue of child care and the government's role in it. However, they are new members and I thought, `We will give them time to settle down and realise that there are times in debate when it really is not appropriate to automatically attack the other side. There are times when you can accept that the other side is basically agreeing with you. If all you can do in your speech is attack the other side, then you really do not have much to say'. I thought these new members might learn that over time. I was a bit disappointed, therefore, to hear it from the parliamentary secretary. I just hope that in the future he might set a better example for those who look to him for guidance and leadership. </PARA>

She did not spend most of her time talking about these amendments, but she did raise a couple of issues which go to the heart of the matter. It appears that she chose to dissociate herself from some of the comments made by opposition members who spoke on the Childcare Rebate Bill and who did not wish to emphasise the issue of choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has been made about supporting women who stay at home, and it was made as if the government was not doing anything about it. This government has been committed to the introduction of the home child-care allowance&mdash;another revolutionary measure. Those who are going out to work will be assisted by the child-care package being put forward by the government, as will those who choose to stay at home. The honourable member for Moncrieff suggested that the government is not going to be assisting men or women&mdash;usually women&mdash;who are staying at home and looking after the children. The government will be assisting them. We have got both sides: those staying at home and those going out to work will be assisted through this child-care package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication that only those who are going out to work will be assisted&mdash;this was very much the stream of comments from other opposition members&mdash;is mistaken. This government is determined to assist parents with children&mdash;whether they wish to go out to work or whether one of them wishes to stay at home and look after the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff said that we should attempt to get as much bipartisan support for these measures as possible. There is no doubt that the support of children is something that we as legislators ought to be committed to for the future of this nation. The honourable member also said that this is something which, 20 or 30 years ago, was not sufficiently emphasised by most members of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recognised how important it is to care for children, be it at home with the mother or in another situation. The government will now be assisting. It has been mentioned that the national accreditation system is a problem. I do not understand why it is a problem. Under that system those people who are going to get very large fee relief, as distinct from those who are getting $28 per child, are asked to go to an accredited centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is asking those who are going to get large fee relief to go to an accredited centre to ensure that their children are being looked after properly. It would be quite incorrect for the government to support these established centres without some quality and standards control. That is why accreditation is a very important issue. I am surprised that some members of the opposition seem to think that there is something wrong with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff said that means testing will not affect ordinary families; it will affect only so-called millionaires. As I said before, average families would be in serious trouble if this amendment were carried. If the means test were applied in the way the opposition suggests, 30,000 families of the 230,000 families eligible for the rebate would be excluded from the scheme and another 20,000 would have a reduced rebate&mdash;a total of 50,000 families would be affected. Another problem would be the massive machinery that would have to be put in place for the means testing of such a proposal. That would be very costly and very bureaucratic. A large amount of money which could be used to directly support families would have to be used for the bureaucratic exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the opposition's argument is simply an attempt to be critical of the government. The honourable member for Moncrieff said that the opposition was surprised that the government went with this proposal. The government has adopted a revolutionary measure and the opposition does not know what to do. The giving of child care was one of the few positive measures in the Fightback package, but that package has been totally rejected by the Australian people. The opposition would not have been able to afford it because, looking at the figures, it would have had to cut about $10 billion out of the package, and I do not think it would have left the child-care suggestion as it was. The government has been able to fund this package as part of its proposals to meet its promise to provide universal child care, and that is to be delivered. Under the circumstances, the amendment is rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot resist it. Let me take the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous) a couple of steps further down the road. He has had a lot of proper things to say about child care. He said that we should all be committed to this, it is important to the future of the nation. In that context he seems to think that the means testing of this particular rebate is somehow reprehensible. I remind him that it is to do with working, and one would think that income had something to do with that. I would like the parliamentary secretary to enlighten me, in light of what he has just said, on how the government justifies means testing family allowances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family allowance was introduced by the Fraser government as a recognition of the economic benefit to the nation of parenting. The dependent child rebate was abolished and the money was transferred into family allowance to replace family endowment, which was a fairly small payment. For people on high income the benefit actually reduced, for those on middle incomes the benefit was about the same or slightly better and those on lower incomes were much better off under the family allowance of the Fraser government compared with the dependent child rebate plus child endowment. It was a very significant step, particularly for women. It was a real statement about a community view, as expressed by the government, on the significance of parenting&mdash;not just of motherhood, although we know that in most cases it was the mother who received the family allowance. It did not matter what people earned, it was a certain amount of money that was not means tested. But along came the Hawke government and said, `This is wrong. If there is a family income of $50,000 we must means test it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was debated quite extensively at the time and I had quite a bit to say. The principle escaped me how the government means tested that payment. The action also raised, for the first time, the issue of reducing one person's entitlement to a benefit because of another person's income. It still remains an inequity. Over 90 per cent of recipients of family allowance are women. The means testing meant that it was their husband's income that was going to determine what benefit they, the mothers, received. The only equivalent treatment of a government payment was TEAS, as it was then. In other words, money paid for students who were fully dependent on their parents was means tested according to the income of the parents. It was the only equivalent payment where one person's entitlement was measured according to another person's income, income over which that first person probably had no control at all and no right of disposal. But the Hawke government extended the practice and decided that women were going to have their family allowance reduced according to their husbands' income. That is the essence of what happened. The logic of that still defies me. Over the years since the federal Labor government has whittled away to the point that family allowances have gone. They have been combined with the family income support&mdash;which, again, the Fraser government introduced&mdash;to create the so-called family assistance scheme. The two are combined and it is essentially a welfare family support measure. The principle went that parenting was part of the economy of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It therefore is for me just a little hard to take when Labor Party politicians say, `It is the Labor Party that stands for the mother and for the family. We are the ones who are extending economic recognition'. It is not true. Many women have lost under this government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill is the government moving to do what we would have done six years ago according to our election promises. The parliamentary secretary tried to dismiss the fact that I had pointed out that it was only just before the last election that the Labor Party finally was dragged kicking and screaming to admit the principle that the cost of child care could be an expense incurred in earning income. It had been the Liberal Party's policy long since that there should be a rebate under those circumstances. I raised it only because the minister moved away from bipartisanship on that. I do not dissociate myself from the members on my side who wanted to emphasise choice. The dichotomy is not on this side but is in the logic of the government saying that in this case means testing is wrong. The logic of this bill is that the child-care rebate is payable only because of income earned. It is logical to then limit the rebate according to the income earned. It was never logical to link the family allowance with the income earned by somebody else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary says that the opposition should be ashamed of itself for suggesting this amendment because the machinery would be costly and bureaucratic. There is always a certain risk, when one sits at the centre table in this House, takes advice from advisers and speaks on behalf of government, that one has not thought the subject through in advance. I suggest to the parliamentary secretary that the government could use the machinery it set up six years ago, initially to means test family allowances, to determine who receives family support. The testing is already done with regard to the family income support scheme. The machinery is already there; all the government has to do is hook this one onto it. The parliamentary secretary should not shake his head. I do not get another chance to speak, so I have to get that in at this stage. The parliamentary secretary gets unlimited chances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government already has all of the machinery in place. Anybody who wants that family support payment and who is earning income now has only to come to the government and say, `This is the income of one income earner in the family' or `These are the incomes of both parents in the family'. It is all there on the record. Not a thing would change in terms of bureaucracy, machinery or cost. The government should use the expensive bureaucracy it set up initially in order to means test family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the original point: there is a need to means test. It is lovely to be able to give everybody everything they want, but there comes a point where governments have to rule it off. We believe the dividing line that we have put down in the amendment is very reasonable. I remind the minister that, in my speech during the second reading stage, I gave him information on the percentage of the population likely to be affected by this measure. I remind him that the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that people on the sort of income we are talking about are very much in the top percentage of income earners in Australia. So the amendments are not niggardly and unreasonable. After all, we are talking about taxable income, not gross income, of $50,000 to $60,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the parliamentary secretary referred to average weekly earnings, he was referring to gross earnings. In talking about average weekly earnings, that figure when multiplied by 52 gives gross income. In talking about means testing an income of $50,000 to $60,000, one is talking about taxable income. The two things really cannot be mentioned in the same breath; it is like comparing oranges with pears. The parliamentary secretary was on quite the wrong track there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have almost run out of time.

The government has found the money to meet this important election promise which should be supported by the whole parliament. </PARA>

<PARA>I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the amendment. The amendment seeks simply to delete clause 60 of the bill. This addresses a specific concern of a technical and legal nature raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. It relates to the treatment of false or misleading statements in clause 60. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee pointed out that subclauses 60(1) and (2) render the making of false or misleading statements strict liability offences. Subclause 60(5) allows a person to claim as a defence that he or she did not know that he or she was making a false statement. However, the wording of this subclause `reverses the onus of proof' in that it forces the defendant to prove that he or she did not know, rather than requires the prosecution to provide proof that the person did know, as is usually the case. The committee pointed out that a reversal of the onus of proof provision is used only where `the matters to be proved by the defendant are peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant'. It did not believe this should apply to the child-care rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee suggested that the offences created in clauses 60 and 61 should not be of strict liability but should require that the prosecution prove all the components of the defence. The amendment to this bill reflects the committee's advice and accordingly omits clause 60 and retains clause 61 which applies to persons knowingly making false or misleading statements and which already places the onus of proof on the prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Advice from the Attorney-General's Department on this matter concurs with the comments made by the committee. That department now advises that the bill should be amended.

It has also advised that no change be made to clause 61.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian National Training Authority was established in December 1992 following an agreement between heads of government in Australia in July of that year. The principal function of the training authority is to draft a national strategic plan for vocational education and training for endorsement by the ministerial council and to allocate Commonwealth and state general funding for vocational education and training. The authority also has as its function the development, jointly with state training authorities, of a state training profile for endorsement by the ministerial council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill (No. 2) is to insert a new provision in the principal act, in relation to the transfer of certain programs from the Commonwealth to the authority, which will enable the authority to undertake the task provided to it. There are also some minor amendments correcting an unrelated drafting oversight in the act. The opening sentences of the Finn report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Young people's participation in post compulsory education and training</EMPHASIS>, proclaims a new educational philosophy for Australia. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both individual and industry needs are leading towards a convergence of general and vocational education. There is an increasing realisation internationally that the most successful forms of work organisation are those which encourage people to be multi-skilled, creative and adaptable. At the same time schools are broadening their programs and curriculums to offer greater access to vocational education for the increasing proportion of young people staying on at the end of compulsory schooling.</PARA>
<PARA>Finn and others have identified the pressing need for Australia to become internationally competitive. They have also indicated that our education and vocational training response will shape the prospects for Australians in the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern about the quality of our education and vocational training system has been expressed by a number of sectors&mdash;by employers, the trade union movement and the higher education and training sector. To these groups must be added parents and students themselves who have been faced with reduced prospects of finding a job and an often bewildering series of changes in their studies, of which the Victorian VCE experiment is probably the best known example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said of late about Australia becoming a clever country; but let us not be a country of clever slogans that give us a warm inner glow and change nothing. These cheap political catchphrases have been used all too often in recent years as a substitute for action. If we were to make a cry, it should be the `industrious country'. We need not only to be better trained, but also to be more productive. The pace of change in Europe, the prospect of major trading blocs involving the European Community and North America, and the rapid development of Asian nations are all causes for national concern. To maintain our standards of living in Australia, which have fallen under this present government, we must be more competitive, and that involves our education system. Education and vocational training are critical issues in tackling this challenge, and they will have much to do with deciding the type of community which we will have in Australia in 10 to 20 years time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The influential report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A nation at risk</EMPHASIS>, upon which the reform of schooling in America over the past decade was founded, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Knowledge, learning information and skilled intelligence are the new raw materials of international commerce and are today spreading throughout the world as vigorously as miracle drugs, synthetic fertilisers and blue jeans did earlier. . . our concern however, goes well beyond matters such as industry and commerce. It also includes the intellectual, moral and spiritual strengths which knit together the very fabric of our society.</PARA>
<PARA>Today, as in any age, it is necessary to continually review the extent to which these factors&mdash;knowledge, learning and information&mdash;are being imparted and utilised in our society. Indeed, there are sufficient indicators to show that we have failed to achieve even basic levels in the past decade. For example, a survey of Regency College of TAFE in South Australia found that 47 per cent of apprentices and 51 per cent of pre-vocational students had reading comprehension ages of between only eight and 12 years. The New South Wales skills testing program in government schools in 1989 revealed that, for each aspect of literacy and numeracy tested, significant numbers of students had mastered only the most elementary skills. A recent survey by a lecturer at a Melbourne tertiary college found that a significant number of first-year students could not multiply two by three without using a calculator. The mathematics department at Melbourne University has recorded a dramatic decrease in standards since the introduction in that state of the VCE. Even in the last year there has been a 15 per cent decrease in the success rate of first-year students in the mid-year test, compared with the previous year's students who were not particularly strong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are being constantly reminded by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) of the increase in school retention rates. It is true that some 77 per cent of students now stay on at school until year 12, compared with just over 40 per cent in 1983. This is pleasing, but it should not be used to paper over the problems in our education system. It is generally conceded, for example, that a proportion of students remain at school because they cannot get a job. We also know that vocational training for 15- to 19-year-olds still remains entirely inadequate. These problems have been remarked on not only overseas, but also here. In 1986, the Business Council of Australia remarked upon the shortcomings of the Australian education system in a report on education. Similar views were expressed by the business higher education round table in the 1991 report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aiming higher</EMPHASIS>, and in the 1992 report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Educating for excellence</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did Labor do in response to these problems? It made all the colleges of advanced education universities, or parts thereof, so that everyone could be said to be going to a university. We constantly hear that X or Y thousands of people qualified for university entrance, but missed out. We have to ask ourselves, `Is it entirely appropriate that everyone who currently qualifies for university should be encouraged in that course?'. It is tragic&mdash;at just the time when almost 80 per cent of the school population is staying on until the final year of school and the abilities and interests of those students, in consequence, are even more uneven than before&mdash;that the federal government has taken it out of our tertiary sector and made applied educational training less available and less socially desirable. So we are getting into a situation, as in America, where we will have people with PhDs driving taxis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Dawkins reforms have meant that in the last three years, for example, the number of law courses being offered has doubled, with around 20,000 lawyers being produced every year. That is almost the entire size of the legal profession in Australia. Yet the diversity of courses on offer in the tertiary sector has been reduced as the ex-colleges of advanced education scramble to appear more like universities and, therefore, clamour loudly for the research dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought it logical to try to aspire to the education models of the countries in the world with the strongest economies, such as Germany and Japan. In both these countries no more than a quarter of school students proceed to university and their industrial training is highly valued. In Japan, this is left to industry and, in Germany, to a dual system in which students do on-the-job training and learn their theory in institutes. Instead, we have set on the unsuccessful courses already charted by America and Britain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This background leads me to the reports about education and training in Australia by Finn, Carmichael and Mayer. The Finn report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Young peoples participation in post compulsory education and training: report of the Australian education council review committee</EMPHASIS>, was presented in July 1991. The committee was appointed by the Australian Education Council&mdash;that is, the Commonwealth and state ministers for education&mdash;and was chaired by the managing director of IBM, Mr Brian Finn. The Finn report sees itself as part of `an extraordinary avalanche of policy development and implementation triggered by the joint impacts of rapidly increasing school retention and labour market and workplace reform'. The report's major recommendation is that, by the year 2001, 95 per cent of 19-year-olds are to have completed year 12 or the initial post-school qualification or be participating in education or training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Education Council and the ministers for vocational employment, education and training then set up a committee under Mr Eric Mayer, chairman of the business-higher education round table and the former chief executive of National Mutual, to explore the concept of key competencies included in one of the recommendations in the Finn report. The Mayer committee subsequently concluded that there were seven key competencies that all young people needed to enable them to participate effectively in the emerging forms of work and work organisations: collecting, analysing and organising information; communicating ideas and information; planning and organising activities; working with others and in teams; using mathematical ideas and techniques; solving problems; and using technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could be forgiven for thinking that these new competencies have been an integral part of successful training for a long time. The final part of this new trinity was offered in the Carmichael report. Essentially, Carmichael sought to answer the question: how do we get 95 per cent of 19-year-olds to undertake vocational training? The answer is to link trainee wages to participation in the training system based on vocation certificates both in the TAFE sector and the upper secondary school years. It is against this background of the last few years that we can examine the developments in training and education in Australia. As is so typical of the Labor government, the outcome of its programs fails to meet its rhetoric. Recently, in answer to a dorothy dixer question in parliament, Minister Beazley said that the government had `a massively successful record in the area of education'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister must have an interesting notion of success. Let us consider these facts. Firstly, participation rates for students in TAFE aged 17 to 24 years was the same in 1992 as it was in 1984, despite funding increases for the TAFE system. Secondly, total TAFE enrolments, as a percentage of total enrolments by age, declined between 1985 and 1991. These facts are graphically illustrated in a graph which I will seek leave to table at the conclusion of my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if the minister was limiting his remarks to higher education&mdash;that is, the universities&mdash;where there has been considerable growth in student numbers, a closer examination of the trends in higher education reveals cause for concern. Professor Richard Sweet pointed out in a recent paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a striking feature of the growth that has occurred since the Unified National System was established&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the effective amalgamation of the colleges of advanced education and the universities&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is how much of it has been generated from within the system.</PARA>
<PARA>Since 1987, continuing students have constituted an increasing proportion of the growth in higher education. These continuing students represented 42 per cent of the total growth between 1987 and 1988 and 66 per cent of the growth from 1987 to 1992. Thus, continuing student numbers are growing faster in higher education than commencing students, who by 1992 were only 28 per cent of students. As Sweet further pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the three year period&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, 1989-1992&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the higher education system as a whole has grown by over a quarter . . . Three quarters of it has come from the increased number of continuing students, at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. But growth has also resulted from a sharp jump in continuation from one level to another&mdash;from those who have had one bite of the cake coming back for another. Whilst undergraduate commencements have only grown by nine per cent, the number of students commencing postgraduate courses has grown five times as fast.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the proportion of students commencing undergraduate studies upon the completion of secondary schooling has actually fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent of all graduates since 1989. As Sweet concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taken together growth in continuation within course levels, growth in continuation from one level of course to another, and growth in those taking a further undergraduate course account for ninety-four per cent of all the growth in higher education student numbers that occurred between 1989 and 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only has the growth resulted from continuation of students in study&mdash;a fact implicitly acknowledged by the Labor government through its proposals to increase the higher education contribution repayment from students taking longer than a semester to complete their courses or undertaking further courses&mdash;but there has been very little change in community access to higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the vice-chancellors pointed out a decade ago, the advent of free higher education had not markedly changed the socioeconomic profile of university students, a fact that led Professor Ronald Henderson, then head of the poverty inquiry, to recommend the charging of fees. Little has changed. To quote from a recent edition of the Department of Employment, Education and Training's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Job Report</EMPHASIS>, there has been very `little change in the proportion of students from poorer and less educated families' in higher education. Indeed, almost none of the growth appears to have resulted in wider community access to higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the minister's recent statement, the only thing massive in this area is the size of the self-deception on the part of government. As a proportion of gross domestic product, expenditure on education in this nation has in fact decreased over a decade. Only recently has the government realised its abject failure to promote vocational training. The minister recently said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a matter of national concern that applications for entry to university are rising faster than the system's apparent capacity to respond and at a time when, given labour market requirements, vocational training may be a better option for many potential students.</PARA>
<PARA>Implicit in this statement and the subsequent campaign to attract students to TAFE is a partial rejection of the Dawkins approach to education which sought to bolster already large numbers by OECD standards of students in Australia in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere is the failure of Labor's approach more evident than in the fact that Commonwealth expenditure in 1989-90 dollars on vocational education was slashed from $460 million in 1984-85 to just over $200 million in 1991-92. This was graphically illustrated in a table on page 3.56 of Budget Paper No. 1 which I will seek leave at the conclusion of my remarks to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), who is at the table, has announced in the last few days Commonwealth funding of $638 million to TAFE, which was in effect a repeat of the promises made by the government in the budget, but it is doubtful whether there would have been, given the record of the government from 1983 to 1991, any substantial increase in the past year had it not been for the substantial commitment to vocational education that the coalition made in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me consider some of the problems that now exist. Compared with other countries, we offer young people very few opportunities to acquire recognised work skills. Only around one in five places occupied by a 16- or 17-year-old is in vocational training. The average in the OECD is one in two. In Europe, the figure is closer to seven in 10. Since 1983, participation in TAFE by teenagers has fallen. ANOP has found that young people's interest in attending university nearly doubled between 1984 and 1990, but interest in TAFE nearly halved. Between 1983 and 1991, the proportion of new apprentices who came directly from school fell from nearly three in four to about one in two. At a time when students leaving school have the highest ever level of qualifications, employers appear to prefer to recruit apprentices from those with some work experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales, for example, the majority of new apprentices are recruited from early school leavers, even though most students now stay on to the Higher School Certificate or year 12 equivalent. Between 1990 and 1991, one in four of all full-time jobs held by teenagers disappeared. The number of full-time jobs lost by teenagers has doubled in each recession, leading to an acceleration in school participation rates. Around half of those who commence the one-year Australian traineeship system have failed to complete it, and nearly two-thirds of those who have left school prior to completing year 12, for whom it was designed, actually drop out. Finally, dropout rates from TAFE amongst young people are very high. Measured by any objective standards, vocational education in Australia might be described as a considerable failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the drive towards a centralist, coercive, corporatist control that marked the higher education agenda in the Dawkins years is evident in the field of vocational education. The history of education in the past decade reflects an increasing concentration of power, not only federally, but in the hands of the minister himself. This concentration of power has been an abiding feature of education and training under Labor and, paradoxically, the major reason for a failure as a nation to improve our education and training. The Dawkins conceptualisation made higher education nothing more than an amalgam of throughput, input and output&mdash;a mere species of central planning and subject to the same management. Centralist, corporatist control is stamped all over vocational education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the language of Labor's approach, the training reform agenda, smacks of predestined control established by central planners in a manner which would have done the old Soviet Union proud. There is also a notion that business has dominated the agenda, reinforced by the chairmanship of Brian Finn and Eric Mayer of two important inquiries. The reality is that the majority of members of these inquiries were public servants, and the secretariats of all the recent national education committees have been comprised almost exclusively of public servants. Again this is the centralist, top-down approach to education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central control is reflected in various elements of the agenda. Take the current obsession with core competencies and the domination of the debate by those concerned to classify, measure and report achievement rather than how to develop and use competence. Let me quote again from Richard Sweet:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In continental Europe a long tradition of scholarly engagement in the study of learning at work has led to a strong concern for embedding process in the way in which vocational education policy and practice are developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Here we place little emphasis on process, but demonstrate almost an obsession with structures. The major focus of European interest in key qualifications, core competencies and the like is how these should be developed, not put into frameworks. There is far greater concern with how to ensure that apprentices and vocational education students actually learn in specific practical situations to plan, cooperate and solve problems than with putting these competencies into generalised multi-level frameworks that pose almost insurmountable problems in assessment.</PARA>
<PARA>The acceptance of the Australian Vocation Certificate&mdash;the pilot system designed to replace apprenticeships and traineeships arising from the Carmichael report&mdash;illustrates the problem. Only 84 of 1,100 positions in the first round of pilots were in the private sector, and the framework has been questioned by many employer and industry representatives. Even the language is not understood by industry. In a recent newsletter of the Business Services Industry Training Board in Victoria, the executive director, Sharron Dickman, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently I was a speaker at a Box Hill College of TAFE breakfast seminar on Competency-Based Training. Like everyone in the audience, I was amused by, and in agreement with, another speaker who lamented about how difficult it was for people involved in training to keep track of TLAs&mdash;Three Letter Acronyms!</PARA>
<PARA>If it is difficult for those who are actually involved in training&mdash;which must be one of the fastest-growing industries in Australia today&mdash;how difficult is it for ordinary employers to comprehend the language, let alone the changes in the system over which they have little control or say. Consider the following memo distributed by the human resources department of a major Australian company:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COSTAC the forerunner of VEETAC established by MOVEET with funding from DEET and the involvement of the NSW DIRECTFE and other STAs recommended that the NTB be established to ensure that CBT was implemented. The CSBs which may be ITABs or ITCs are responsible for developing national standards. As a result, the development and accreditation of courses must follow these standards and guide-lines established by NFROT and VETAB utilising RATE descriptions. The STAs are also very keen to integrate into CBT RPL/RRC.</PARA>
<PARA>I challenge the minister to find one employer in a thousand who understands that memo. I invite the minister at the table to interpret it, if he wants to, in his later remarks. We are staring at a national disaster as we are led up the garden pathways of an acronym-led reform. This confusion is not as significant for large business and industry, which can employ trainers and management to implement a training system, as it is for those who actually provide the bulk of the work and employment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers are concentrated in the service sector industries and the small business sector. Employers who number less than half of the self-employed, of which there are about 850,000, declined by four per cent between 1980 and 1992, compared with a growth in employees of 22 per cent. But 28 per cent of employers are in the retail industry, compared to 15 per cent of wage and salary earners, and two-thirds of employers have less than five employees. In addition, two-thirds of managers are responsible for small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia today, two out of three jobs held by teenagers are in only three industries: wholesale and retail trade; finance, property and business services; and recreation, personal and other services. The same industries account for 40 per cent of total employment. These industries employ more than half of all school leavers, and over 80 per cent of all employed students. Ninety-four per cent of all jobs in these industries are in the private sector, and 50 per cent of them are in firms employing less than 20 employees. These firms are also youth intensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It follows that a national education and training policy that does not involve small business employers and their managers is seriously flawed. Yet this is the model of Labor's training reform agenda. The top-down, paternalistic approach is reflected elsewhere in the training reform agenda&mdash;the Mayer competencies, the national curriculum and the Australian standards framework. When anyone utters concerns about the inadequacy of this approach, such as the states did at the meeting of the Australian Education Council in July, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training bullies them with the threat of a cut in Commonwealth funding. Yet a comparison with other nations reveals the extent of the problems in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already indicated the failure of this government to address vocational education in the past decade&mdash;a matter that it is only now starting to redress. As the recent report by the Economic Planning Advisory Council indicated, there has been too great an emphasis on expanding places in higher education and too little attention to schools and work-based training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Competitive Advantage of Nations</EMPHASIS>, Professor Michael Porter argues the importance of education and training in competition between nations. He shows that those countries which have invested heavily in training, such as Germany, Japan and Korea, obtained competitive advantages attributable to their human resources. Conversely, OECD reports indicate that ineffective training and education is a major factor in long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent report commissioned by the Employment and Skills Formation Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training shows a greater emphasis on on-the-job training in Germany, France, Hong Kong and Singapore than in Australia. This is not new news. The clear message, from comparisons with successful overseas nations, is that a link into the secondary school system is necessary for the realistic development of a vocational education system. However, this is a link that must involve employers at the industry and enterprise level, otherwise the necessary partnership will not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the real challenge that faces Australia in providing a world-class vocational education system. The Labor government has finally grasped the need for vocational training, but remains constrained by a centralist approach. Yet there are instances of well integrated education-industry programs that could serve as a model for the nation: for example, the TRAC programs which have been developed by the Dusseldorp Skills Forum in New South  Wales,  and in the recent New  South Wales <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Directions</EMPHASIS> document on vocational education the important link between schools, education and industry is highlighted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With three-quarters of students now staying on to year 12, the vocational education link is a necessary feature of future training. The success, therefore, or otherwise of the ANTA board in achieving its objectives and in implementing a more flexible training system will determine largely the future of vocational education in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, this bill provides part of the mechanism for ANTA to undertake its tasks. There are some promising signs. The board has a project before it to rationalise the number and coverage of industry training advisory boards and to establish a necessary database about training in Australia. The board was recently charged with the preparation of a national strategic plan for a simplified system. This focus of ANTA is a welcome change from the bureaucratically dominated VETAC, which has provided advice to ministers over the past few years. Similarly, there is a case for a change of focus for the national training board, for it to provide for adequate industry participation if it is to be retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real challenge is to provide a system which will work; that is, internationally competitive vocational education and training. The next generation of Australians will not thank us if we spend millions of dollars on a system which will do little for their skills and prospects for future employment. The tragedy of Labor's decade has not only been the loss of jobs for millions of Australians, and the growing gap between the rich and poor, but the massive failure to provide an education and training system which will allow their children to get jobs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill (No. 2). The Australian National Training Authority has been established to develop and maintain, in conjunction with the states and territories, a national vocational education and training system. The authority has nationally agreed objectives, strategies and planning processes aimed at meeting the needs of industry and at supporting an effective training market which includes public and private providers, promoting an efficient network of publicly funded providers, increasing opportunities and outcomes for individuals and improving links with other education sectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANTA's operating budget is determined by the Commonwealth-State Ministerial Council, which was established by the July 1992 heads of government agreement on the national vocational education and training system. The allocation for ANTA's operating budget in 1993-94 is $8.892 million. Because the transfer of national programs will occur in the middle of the financial year, the full financial year allocations are different. On that basis of a cash flow estimate, a total of $19.9 million has been allocated to ANTA for national program payments during the second half of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANTA's national program supports vocational education and training activities and services which are national in scope and purpose as determined by the ministerial council. From July 1994, the authority will assume responsibility for several program elements currently administered by the present department, which the ministerial council has agreed to designate as national programs. The resource agreements with states and territories for 1993 provide separately identified funding for recurrent support infrastructure. General recurrent grants for TAFE of $344.681 million are 32 per cent higher in real terms than in 1992. This is primarily the result of the government's intention in the One Nation statement to provide additional funding for TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In several ways the grants assist Australia's vocational education and training system. They provide a skilled and flexible work force to enable Australian industry to be competitive in domestic and international markets. This is an extremely important measure, one that many parts of Australia are grappling with. The restructuring of our economy, which has been going on since 1984-85 when the first moves were made to float the dollar and move to an international market, has created amazing changes right across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those changes is that we need a skilled and flexible work force. As part of this government I am pleased to be able to say that we have been able to negotiate through many minefields in relation to these issues. ANTA is just part of providing those skills to a flexible work force. Without that we will not be internationally competitive. It is also there to improve the skills and quality of life of Australians and, in particular, the needs of disadvantaged groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that your area and mine have large power industries which have restructured and are restructuring in the national grid process. We certainly can lay claim to having areas which have disadvantaged groups. It is a bit of an anachronism in today's society that sometimes when we talk of disadvantaged groups we talk of poor people. But, very often, disadvantaged groups come from many of the skilled people who had good salaries in the past but now find themselves&mdash;as part of a restructure&mdash;living in regions of Australia where the down-sizing of some of these industries has created enormous disadvantages for people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we have a training program designed for and effective in picking up the skills of these people and adding to them. They may have had a skill for 25 or 30 years in a particular industry, but upon moving out of that industry they may find those skills need to be upgraded. This is why it is very important that we have not only a flexible work force but also a flexible training system. The moves towards ANTA and the measures attached to this legislation are certainly extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electorate of McMillan, which covers the Latrobe Valley, and which has some of the largest deposits of coal in the world, is certainly a disadvantaged area in relation to training. We are very keen to be involved in the new training programs. We are seeing many of them coming through and being put into effect. We expect that when ANTA is up and fully running we will see many more improvements in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the region that I represent there has been a strong move to bring together into a single operation many of the TAFE programs which have been and are being developed to assist people moving from one industry to another. Discussions are going on between representatives of our local Gippsland regional TAFE body and ANTA in relation to some programs that have been agreed to by the government. The planning and strategies are being put in place for the future. It will be extremely important that it is brought to fruition as quickly as possible. I am sure that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), who is at the table, is aware of them and will keep lobbying on those matters for the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One national cooperative activity is very important. Since 1991, a proportion of TAFE recurrent grants money has been set aside for national cooperative activity to assist in the implementation of the training reform agenda. In 1993, $19.1 million has been allocated to national projects. Agreed projects for 1993-94 fall into six categories corresponding to national goals set by the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers for vocational education and employment training. Some $0.75 million has been allocated under the national training system to flexible delivery and other projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The open learning and flexible delivery of national staff development program has now been implemented in several states. In relation to quality, $15.6 million has been allocated to projects which assist the achievement of this goal. These include curriculum and materials, staffing issues and the national management information and statistical systems. Opportunities and outcomes for individuals have also been looked at. Some $0.92 million has been allocated to projects which meet this goal. About $0.5 million has been allocated to the training strategy for small firm projects. That is a very important initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing I found in my experience as a member of parliament&mdash;in my previous term in the parliament I sat on a committee which for two years studied small business in Australia&mdash;was the need for training in the management of small business. That is extremely important and one matter we possibly have not put enough effort into. Many small businesses are really struggling when they move on from the days of employing five or six people. When opportunity knocks they move up to 20 or 25 employees&mdash;perhaps to 40 or 50. Very often, one of the great needs of management&mdash;and it is very important&mdash;of industry is for a training strategy for small firms. It is important that that be fostered; Australia needs it badly at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Infrastructure grants are provided for the construction or refurbishment of TAFE facilities and for the acquiring of equipment. In 1993 the allocation for buildings will be $172.5 million; for equipment it will be $31.94 million; and for child-care facilities it will be $3 million. Projects particularly encouraged are those that: generate more places in TAFE, particularly in areas of skill shortage or importance to economic development; upgrade equipment in TAFE, particularly equipment which is associated with the introduction of new and advanced technologies and projects that encourage industry to contribute towards the purchase of equipment; upgrade older facilities to contemporary training requirements; and also, of course, expand child care for TAFE students by building child-care centres. I am pleased to say that only just recently we have opened a significant child-care centre at the TAFE college in the city of Moe, which is very supportive of the students in that region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need to generate more places in TAFE certainly is a topic in the education community today. In the electorate of McMillan, we in the region of the Latrobe Valley also have the Gippsland campus of Monash University, which was a CAE. A total corridor is being developed where there is the university campus and the TAFE facilities, and now they are looking at the extension of that into the new business facility where some of the more modern up-to-date training will be developed and put into place. So we have as one of our rather large growth industries in the region education as an industry of itself with the TAFE college and the university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the changing structures that are taking place in the electricity industry. Many of the people who worked in that industry are moving from government employment and some are going across to the new companies which have moved in and have taken over the privatisation area of the SEC&mdash;companies such as Siemens, Fluor Daniel and Geo-Engineering. There are many of them that are now outsourcing the SEC works. They are also using the training facilities to upgrade a lot of their employees. As well as that, the most important issue that we face in the training area relates to those 40 or 50 per cent of former SEC workers whom these companies find, at this stage, until they can generate more work, they do not need on their books. They are finding that these people are taking packages and moving away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that are developing very quickly is a service industry from energy resource. In the region we now have groups of these workers who are forming themselves into small consortiums and companies and are in great demand for their skills in overseas countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia&mdash;all over South-East Asia. We are finding that the connections that have been developed between university, TAFE and our Gippsland group training company are such that the training facilities are at full stretch covering the needs of industry and the opportunities of the future. It is good to see that it is not all doom and gloom, that many of these people are now taking the opportunity in the private sector to move into these new work opportunities. But they cannot do it without the training programs. That is why this government's policies in relation to this have been extremely important. It has all been a package worked out over many years; it is not happening overnight. It is extremely important for these people to be able to get the upgraded skills that they require. There are many programs being developed which will assist them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few comments on arrangements for 1994 and ANTA. As I have said, it was formally established in December 1992 to be responsible for national strategic planning and funding, and these new arrangements will come into effect fully on 1 January 1994. State and territory training agencies will continue to manage the delivery of vocational education and training and allocate funds at the state and territory level. However, for 1994 and beyond each will develop in conjunction with ANTA a state training profile, that is, a plan for the delivery and support of vocational education and training for endorsement by the ministerial council. This will ensure that all states and territories are working within an agreed national strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is pretty important because one of the things that I believe Australia has to face up to is that there are limits to the amount of infrastructure and spending that the nation can afford and there are priorities. We have to prioritise where the nation's benefits are to be, and no more so than in the education and training area. I am sure that the regions of Australia outside of the capital cities, and the suburbs of the capital cities, in certain areas are well aware of their strengths and are being given the opportunity now to ensure that those strengths fit into national strategy arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to be involved in an electorate which is part of the national grid discussions that are going on and to see the importance to the national economy of the total structure and how we restructure an industry to go into the international area. These arrangements that require states and territories to work within an agreed national strategy are extremely important. The scatter-gun approach days are over, and we need to really focus on some of the major areas. From 1 January 1994 the funding arrangements under the State Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act will be replaced by new rolling triennial funding arrangements under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. Under the new arrangements, a single pool of funds comprising the previously separate Commonwealth recurrent grants and infrastructure grants will be passed to ANTA for allocation among the states and territories in accordance with principles agreed by the ministerial council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A total of $630 million will be provided to ANTA for this purpose in 1994. This includes an additional $70 million in growth funding above the 1993 funding levels. For 1994 the ministerial council has determined that the same real level of capital funds as was provided by the Commonwealth in 1993 should be allocated for expenditure of a capital nature. The allocation of growth funding will be conditional upon states and territories agreeing with ANTA to pursue specific national strategies, further details of which are provided in a statement of priorities produced by ANTA and endorsed by the ministerial council. Funds of up to $27 million will be allocated for national projects, formerly national cooperative activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">States and territories will identify specifically in their profiles the activities supported by the Commonwealth's contribution to adult literacy through the general funding arrangements, that is notionally $7 million, and funds of up to $5 million will be allocated to support interstate cooperative projects which increase student places. Examples are through cross-border provisions, key centres and areas of high cost delivery or special expertise, flexible learning and remote area provisions for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives me great pleasure to support the bill and to have the opportunity to make a few comments on it. The area that I represent in Victoria, as I have said, is an extremely important one to the nation, and at the moment we are going through a restructure which is having enormous effects on the area. A matter that I wish to bring before the House tonight, particularly with the minister present, is the need, in looking at future programs, to meet the requirements of people in regional Australia&mdash;to look at how they are going to benefit from training programs and at what training programs will be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my region there is a clear need for structural change at the local management level. I am not talking here strictly about local government boundaries in management; I mean the management by the local people themselves in local government&mdash;the skills of local government as such&mdash;so that, as an area moves from being a country town, or three or four closely gathered country towns, into a city, there is a need for many of the staff to upgrade their skills, to reach out to larger horizons, both nationally and internationally, and, as workers in local government or participants in local government, to be able to provide the necessary backup and support that industry requires also in developing new opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some programs being developed in the cities region of the Latrobe Valley at the present time between the cities of Traralgon, Morwell and Moe, all of which have populations of 20,000 people, which are coming together in a way that will see them act as a central body on these sorts of issues. I hope that in the very near future they will have a program put forward which will allow for a substantial training component to be part of a development strategy for that total city region. Solid work has been done on this at the present time. We had the opportunity to present a fairly substantial submission to the Kelty task force on regional development, which has the need for training as a major objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I am very pleased to be able to support this legislation. This government has continually moved in the correct direction in relation to policy for education. Our opponents on the other side at times make allegations that cannot be substantiated by fact in relation to how much better off people are today with regard to education than they were a few years ago. It is extremely important that we continue this process, and I look forward to our area in particular participating with ANTA, the government, the states and the ministerial council in developing real programs which will continue to assist our people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me tell the honourable member about it. It was during the period when mainland China was essentially isolated from the rest of the world. The cartoon was entitled `China Experts'. It featured a picture of the massive walls of the Forbidden City, with signs of hubbub and noise inside. Around the base of this great wall were a number of serious looking, bespectacled, white-coated figures with stethoscopes pressed against the wall, carrying clipboards and taking notes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the same kind of problem as Petty's China experts, because since the election I have been seeking clues about exactly what opposition policy is in this vital area of vocational education and training. I really do try to discover what it is the opposition stands for in this important area of policy. For example, I have read the opposition's press releases. They hardly ever get published. I actually read them in their original form but, for my sins, I listen to speeches of the opposition, like the one given this evening by the honourable member for Menzies. I must confess that I come away on most occasions empty-handed, none the wiser. I am sure the honourable member for Menzies is a well-intentioned and very nice person, but I cannot discover what he stands for in this important area of policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for me a tantalising exercise because occasionally one gets a hint of a clue. Tonight we did get a few hints. I do not think the honourable member for Menzies likes the unified national higher education system. I think I have learnt that much. I think he resents the progress the government has made in building up school retention rates from 34 per cent when the honourable member's party left office to 77 per cent last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think he is concerned about the balance between higher education and vocational education. I am very pleased to join with him in that regard. That is the whole point of the Finn,  Carmichael and Mayer exercise. He ought to devote himself more assiduously to understanding some of the complexities. I think he is wrong to question the role of the Mayer competencies, for example. I agree with him that participation in TAFE needs to grow. I am pleased to say that it grew last year. But he does the debate less than complete service by harking back to figures in years gone by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point of what the government is doing, the whole point of the ANTA agreement, is a recognition that we need to get the balance between higher education and vocational education right, that we need to have the right arrangements with the states, that we need to contribute quite massive amounts of resources from the Commonwealth towards those objectives. That is the whole point of the ANTA agreement; that is the whole point of this legislation; that is the whole point of the Commonwealth's commitment of $1.1 billion over four years to grow a first-class, quality vocational education and training system in this country. I am proud that the government will be funding TAFE to the tune of $638 million next year and I am proud that those funds will grow TAFE in Australia next year by over 40,000 extra places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Menzies is certainly entitled to question the government's commitment to vocational education and training. That is his job; he is a member of the opposition and that is his job as a member of the opposition. He will have lots of time in opposition to develop those skills even further. At some stage before we defeat those opposite on the next occasion, I seek a clearer statement of his own position and the opposition's position in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy in this field to go for the cheap laugh on the question of acronyms. It is easy to trivialise the TRA&mdash;that is, the training reform agenda&mdash;by referring to the acronyms which abound throughout the system. But they are important. They represent important building blocks in training reform. That is not just me saying that; we will get support for those building blocks from organisations like CRA, BHP, IBM and the BCA, not to mention the ACTU. So acronyms very often represent important building blocks, as they do in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is far too common, when people discuss the training reform agenda, to seek a simple description of the system. Simple descriptions really apply only to simple solutions. One cannot have simple solutions to a complex set of problems. We have a complex set of problems in training reform in this country which the government has comprehensively moved to address with the assistance of industry, the trade union movement and, to varying extents, the states. I am pleased to say there has been quite a degree of positive support from the states&mdash;not without some exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Menzies referred to the ministerial council meeting in Perth in July. Some of his conservative colleagues from the states revealed the same kind of frustration that he showed during part of his speech this evening. They found the agenda too long. One of them said there was too much to read; it was all a bit too tough. That is the impression I get from some of the public speeches by the honourable member for Menzies. I enjoyed one that he gave on 3 June when he talked about the notion of convergence between vocational education and general education which emerged as a central theme of the Finn report. This was the view of the honourable member for Menzies on 3 June:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cry from the corporate sector and the government is that vocational education and general education should be integrated, but there are two reasons why we should promote a thoroughly grounded general education in the humanities and pure sciences. A more instrumentalist, vocationally oriented education is presumed to best accommodate industry's need for workers in a rapidly changing business environment as the topic for this discussion puts it. I suggest that it is precisely because the business environment is rapidly changing that we cannot allow education to be confused with vocational training. If we do this we will find that we are producing people whose narrowly based skills are already out of date by the time they graduate.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that can be summarised by saying, `It is all too tough; you can't tell what industry is going to require, so there is not much point in developing a training reform agenda'. He reinforced this point later in the speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second reason for rejecting the instrumentalization of education is that we are likely to have a large permanently unemployed workforce. Their education will be wasted if it equips them only to make cogs and perform industrial processes that they will never be involved with because they are unlikely to get jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>This was the honourable member's conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They must be educated for rational leisure.</PARA>
<PARA>The only policy I can see emerging from that is a policy of despair, a policy that says, `It is all too hard; let's give up'. If that is the opposition's position, I feel very sorry for it. Nevertheless, at this stage of my search for a clear statement of opposition policy in this area, I am forced to concur with the conclusion arrived at by Jane Dargarville after interviewing the honourable member for Menzies last month. In describing him, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Andrews is side-kick to the coalition's senior employment, education and training portfolio spokesman, one of the Liberal's shining stars, Michael Wooldridge. Wooldridge's and Andrews' stock answers to questions about what the coalition's new education policy will shape up like is that they are in the process of travelling the country, talking to people, trying to find out what is needed and wanted.</PARA>
<PARA>She concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is apparent from talking to both men that there is currently a dearth of wide ranging expertise in the field of education within the ranks of the parliamentary Liberal Party.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I appreciate having the opportunity to say a few more words this afternoon about education, particularly in light of the comments made by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) on some matters of education in the previous debate. The minister took great delight in my expression of what I regard to be a fairly realistic assessment&mdash;made by most Australians, if not some people in this place&mdash;that, for many people, the prospect of gaining employment under the present government is not that great.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are constantly being reminded that the government established a task force on unemployment. Not so long ago, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) admitted that long-term unemployment will be a fact of life for many people. That is a tragedy and we should not simply white-wash the situation and pretend, as this government seems to do, that jobs will be found by snapping our fingers. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian public is sick and tired of being told that we are about to turn the corner. This goes back to the famous J-curve: things were always going to get better under this government. But the people out on the street know the reality: that things are tough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They know we are facing a considerable period of having great numbers of unemployed people in this country. What they are looking for is hope, a sense of future security, and opportunities in education for their children. To be told in a patronising manner that things will be all right when we have had years and years and years of seeing that things are not all right is an incredible approach to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also welcome the opportunity to speak on education matters this afternoon because the minister has said, if I can paraphrase his words, that he has been looking in vain for an opposition policy on education generally. I remind the minister that the government's commitment to funding for schools&mdash;the additional funding it has promised and which is now being implemented&mdash;and its additional funding to vocational education and training seems to be almost million dollar for million dollar what the coalition had promised in the policies it announced back in 1991. It begs the question: had it not been for the coalition's 1991 policy to make substantial increases to education funding in both of these areas, would the government have been moved to match it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated in the previous debate, a graph of the reduction in funding for vocational education and training from 1991 to 1993 indicates a reduction of something like $460 million to just over $200 million. While it is true that the government has recently increased that figure to over $600 million, it has taken it a decade to do something about the matter. It now comes along and says, `Well, we are finally doing something'. I congratulate the government for finally doing something but it is a tragedy that we had a decade in which nothing was done when it should have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not reply to the personal remarks that the minister made in the previous debate. It was not an appropriate level of debate for a matter which is as important to the people of Australia today and in the future as education. However, I remind the minister that there are problems in education&mdash;problems about which we are often reminded by the press. The minister complained that I was harking back to some old statistics. Some of those statistics, however, are from the most recent studies available. In 1983-84 the International Association for Evaluation of Education Achievement conducted a study comparing the performance of students around the world. This study, the most recent of its kind&mdash;I admit that it is a decade old&mdash;revealed that the level of achievement of 14-year-olds in Australia was far below the level in Japan and significantly below that in a number of European countries, including some in eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 the Australian Council for Education Research found that only 77 per cent of year 9 students achieved the minimum reading competency required in adult society. The study also found that standards in spelling and certain mathematical skills had declined since 1980. Then there was the recent report of the parliamentary committee on literacy that found that as many as 25 per cent&mdash;certainly, on recent reports, as many as 10 to 15 per cent&mdash;of children leaving primary school are unable to read or write adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you asked parents with children in any school in any part of Australia what they wanted for their children's education, particularly in primary school, they would say that they wanted a few basic things. They would hope that when their children left primary school they could read adequately, write adequately, and carry out basic arithmetic and mathematics&mdash;addition, multiplication, subtraction, the use of fractions, and so on. Yet here we have evidence, reported in newspaper articles particularly over the last few months, that a significant number of Australian primary schoolchildren are leaving primary school without achieving a basic level of skills. It is useless to suggest that there are no problems facing education in Australia; there are. It is no use the minister running away and asking what our policy is. His party has been in government since 1993-94, so why do we still have these problems today?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to the detail of this particular bill. The bill is like a curate's egg: good in parts. We welcome the initiatives which extend support to hostels for rural students. We welcome the support to be given to a pilot program for students with disabilities. We welcome the assistance being extended to students in the students at risk program. However, there are other aspects of the bill that we do not welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said he could not identify our policy. Our education policy was set out prior to the election. Surely even the minister would applaud any political party spending time listening to the people. That is what I have been doing for the last three or four months. I know of the restrictions placed on ministers. Canberra is an isolated place and being a minister is an isolating existence. I suspect that the reality is that the further one moves up the pole of political responsibility, such as to the ministerial level, the more difficult it becomes to get out amongst the people, talk to them, and get advice and input from them. Much of what comes through to the minister, naturally enough, is coloured by what comes through the bureaucracy. While it would be nice for the minister if I came out and made all sorts of fancy statements about doing this or that in education, that would not be reality. I know what the reality is. I have been spending my time listening to the people who have something to contribute to developing education policy. I can assure the minister that I will continue to do that and that he will see that policy in good time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the points, though, in the coalition's previous policy&mdash;and it is a standing commitment of the coalition&mdash;is that it strongly objects to restrictions being placed on the starting up of new non-government schools. Currently, a school wishing to operate at a new location, amalgamate, provide an additional level of education or separate into two or more schools must give notice two years before 1 March in the year in which that change is proposed. The main effect of this part of the bill is that that period of notice will be extended to three years before 31 October for changes which are proposed to come into operation on or after 1 January 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear policy of the coalition has been, and is, to abandon this shackle on the people's choice of education. After all, the education which individuals receive is the key to their success in later life. We owe children from all backgrounds&mdash;whether they are from Sunshine, Bankstown, Double Bay or Toorak&mdash;a fair go. The situation which has arisen under this government's new schools policy is that, because new non-government schools are given a lower level of government subsidy when they open, they are effectively put out of the price range of those in the community who are not comfortably well off. Yet again, this is an ideologically driven Labor government that penalises its own in the working class constituencies, which, if one looks around the country, is where many of these new schools are commencing. The message is: unless people are well off, they will not have any educational choice or, at least, their choice will be severely limited. They will be compelled to take what they can get at the local state school. My party for one, if the minister is looking for policy, believes that choice for everyone&mdash;not only the wealthy&mdash;ought to be a fundamental tenet in relation to education policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also announced in the budget the expenditure of $3.6 million of developmental funding over the three years from 1994 to 1996 to support existing and developing hostels for rural school students. These provisions in the bill implement this announcement. It is notable that boarding schools appear to have been excluded from the additional funds for rural hostels although they compete directly in many cases. For example, in Queensland there is a clear, direct competition between boarding schools and rural hostels. This policy seems to favour the rural hostels over the boarding schools, although the record of boarding schools in providing education is one which I do not believe can be questioned in terms of what they have actually provided over the years. Clause 15(3) seeks to define the number of students receiving education at a school. Clause 15(3)(a) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the student attends, on a daily basis, a systemic school in the system or the school . . . at the location set out in the list of non-government schools in respect of that school . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Although there is provision for the minister to make exception in special circumstances, this provision seems overly restrictive. For example, there are many students who attend TAFE, another school or campus for part or many of the days of the week in order to complete parts of their school course. We were talking in an earlier bill about the desirable flexibility of a vocational education system which integrates both TAFE and work with secondary school, particularly at the upper levels. It seems that this practice is one which would run into problems in relation to this particular clause. There are also students with special needs who attend a regular school, say, for four days a week and a special school for the other day. Again, they are not in attendance at the particular location for each day of their schooling week. Most schools provide excursions or bush camps, and therefore students may be absent from school for those reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one turns to Aboriginal students, which the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) has a particular interest in, there are some who may be absent to attend family or ceremonial commitments. It is interesting that awards and enterprise agreements are now also beginning to recognise that those students may wish to go to those family or ceremonial commitments. Yet, we have the irony that it appears that the effect of this clause would be to preclude those students from being regarded as in attendance at school on such days, unless of course they have obtained the special exemption of the minister. This must happen at every school in Australia, every day of the school week, and it seems ridiculous therefore that one would have to apply for a special exemption in those circumstances. Accordingly, in the Senate the coalition will be proposing that the words `unless there is reasonable excuse for a student not to be in attendance at that location' be added to clause 15&mdash;that is, proposed new section 55(3)(a). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That seems to pick up what I think is a fairly reasonable proposition. It is also consistent with state education acts where, for the most part, the regulation or requirement that children attend school in this country usually to the age of 15 has a provision which relates to a reasonable excuse for those children not being at school. It seems that the Commonwealth regulations in relation to this ought to be consistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn then to the national equity program for schools&mdash;the acronym for which is NEPS&mdash;which grew out of a review in 1992. The national equity program brings together a number of formerly separate Commonwealth programs targeted at removing the educational disadvantage of many school students. The new program framework has already been introduced through the 1993 administrative guidelines and the relevant legislation. During 1993, the programs continue to be administered separately within that framework. The national equity program will, however, be fully implemented from 1994. The long lead time reflects the need for extensive consultation about the changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes which occur with the full implementation of this program include a reduction in Commonwealth administrative requirements; funding on a rolling triennium basis which will allow education authorities, including schools, to plan more effectively on the basis of more stable funding from year to year; separate funding allocations for the government, Catholic and independent sectors in each state; pooling of funds within the components of the access element&mdash;that is, within the special education and English as a second language programs but not between them; and public agreements between the Commonwealth and education authorities receiving funding under the program, covering objectives, targets, mechanisms for community involvement, evaluation and the provision of nationally consistent data on equity outcomes. The Department of Employment, Education and Training consulted during May and June with education authorities and other organisations, including teachers, parents and community groups with particular interest in equity programs, about how these changes should be fully implemented in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major issue surrounding the introduction of the program is the Commonwealth's insistence that the states publicly account for the use of both Commonwealth and state funds. This issue is one which is yet to be resolved between the Commonwealth and the states. Of particular concern to the coalition in the national equity program is the fate of the country education project. There is a strong fear in rural and regional Australia that the effect of this bill and the changes in it which will give more flexibility to the states will mean some or all of the funds received by a state or non-government school authority for schools in prescribed country areas or which are declared geographically isolated will be applied instead to the disadvantaged schools of the cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the country areas program receives $14.2 million as against $60.9 million for disadvantaged schools under the equity component of the federal government's national equity program for schools. The country areas program has been a model of best practice, distributing Commonwealth funds to clusters of government and non-government schools which then share the resources purchased. A handful of field workers in each state liaise with the clusters of schools in order to disseminate information about the latest educational techniques and resources available. It is likely that these may well disappear with the full implementation of the national equity program for schools. The national equity program purports to regard the curriculum as the key to turning around educational disadvantage but will enable the effective dismantling of the very system in the country areas program for broadening the curriculum through resource sharing and the development of innovative educational programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new arrangements there appear to be no clear benchmarks to ensure that the pooling of resources continues. What we have now is a three-tier system in which the local community, together with the school councils, makes grassroots decisions about what is best for their schools. It is an example of democracy at its finest, that is, local people getting together to decide their own future. Under the new arrangements, with funding going directly to the individual schools rather than to the areas, it is inevitable that schools will compete against each other for what could easily be ever decreasing funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This comes about because, whilst there are specific funds provided to each of the country areas and to the disadvantaged schools, there is provision in the legislation that funds provided for one purpose may be used for the other purpose. The fear which is being expressed in rural and regional Australia is that over a period country areas funding will be frozen or will diminish with greater emphasis on disadvantaged schools, and therefore a program which has been effective in the provision of better educational advantage for country school children will be diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister may say to me in response, `That is a problem then for the states'. In effect, he is handing that back to the states and they will decide which funds are used from the pools and whether there is that intermingling of funds. Given that the minister retains some residual authority to designate an area as a country area program, the question is whether there should be some benchmarks in place so that there is some assurance that the country areas programs will continue or whether people in country areas should take up a political fight with the state government, of whatever complexion, in order to ensure that these programs continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not picking any particular party. We have an instance where that has happened in Queensland under a state government. The Queensland education minister issued a statement on 30 September that, because of the concerns about the country areas funding in Queensland, he would ensure that it continues. All I am saying is that, given that there is a residual authority in the Commonwealth minister and that the minister may declare a country area, should there not be some benchmarks in place whereby there can be a guarantee that there is that funding or at least there can be some review of the way in which that funding is changed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We propose to move an amendment in the Senate to provide that the country areas program be reviewed in two years time to ensure that current levels of funding remain in place or that there be some measure of assessment of what has happened with the country areas program. Disadvantage may be more visually obvious perhaps in inner Melbourne or Sydney but educational disadvantage may exist in the most outwardly idyllic circumstances in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural children simply do not have the same educational opportunities in Australia as urban children. It costs twice as much for a child's education if the child has to be sent away to school or university and there is no real recognition of these costs by this Labor government. Able children are missing out in the country because their parents do not have the incomes to subsidise education at the post-compulsory level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letters I have read from country people detailing their plight are heart-rending. I will read one of these letters to the House because government members need the reality of the plight in the country sheeted home, just how much rural Australia is suffering because of the short-sighted policies which, in reality, foster the clueless country rather than the clever one. Kids who once could have got Commonwealth scholarships under us, if they were able students, are now often unable to proceed with their education because their farming parents cannot afford to pay for their education. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I am a fifth generation farmer but my son is not keen to be a farmer, he does exceptionally well at school recently getting in the top 100 out of 30,000 in a big Science comp, in all the Math and Science comp's he has always been in the top 1%, he has just done work experience in a computer drawing office. My five yearly average income is $12,219 and not likely to improve, he is 15 and a half and there is no way I would qualify for Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The end result of all this is that he will be locked into a life such as mine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I lived in the city his talents would come to be fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I realise this is not what you wish to read but writing letters is something that I have great trouble with. For every letter you get a hundred who would wish they could express their thoughts, but don't for fear of being not understood.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only have many country kids not been able to get a better education but also in the future kids who seek a different life are locked out by financial restraints of the parents.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a real issue at present in rural and regional Australia which is suffering from the effects of the recession and from natural disasters such as floods and droughts. It is for these reasons that the coalition considers it vital that the country areas program remain in place and at least at its present level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The part of the bill dealing with special education provides that the minister may make a determination authorising payment to a state or a nominated non-government school body for special education programs for young children with disabilities and children in residual care, and capital projects for children and students with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents' groups have expressed concerns about the three-sector funding proposal locking children into a sector and taking away flexibility of movement between sectors to meet changing needs. Some children are currently being educated in two sectors&mdash;attending a special school and being integrated part time into a school in another sector. The current administration of special education program funds by non-school organisations means that the services are linked to the child with disabilities and not to the specific school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many current providers fear that they will be forced into a bureaucratic and administrative maze of dealing with three school sectors and possibly numerous regions. Special educators are concerned that some schools or school sectors will not appreciate the considerable commitment of resources needed for some disabled children, leading to a reduction in the actual funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three school sectors have no relevance to the distribution of early intervention funds, particularly those used for below pre-school age children. As a consequence, I understand that the minister is looking into this matter and that the funding of non-school organisations has been quarantined for 1994 pending a further evaluation of the program. I raise this matter because it is a real concern for many. Despite concerns about the downgrading of country areas programs, the bill does introduce more flexibility into funding arrangements. The provision of funding between programs will be a matter for each of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the position of the coalition in relation to this bill is that, in line with our policy, we will oppose in the committee stage those clauses of the bill which relate to further restrictions in the new schools policy. I foreshadow that we will seek to move an amendment in the Senate. Maybe the minister will take that amendment on board and give some consideration to it. It spells out that there can be a reasonable excuse for children not being at a school on a particular day, which is consistent, as I said earlier, with state legislation regulating schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we will seek to refer the matter of the country areas program to a Senate committee. We will look at providing in the legislation some way of reviewing the operation of the country areas program in two years time so that we can ensure that those real fears and concerns of people in rural and regional Australia are met. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1993. The bill amends the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 to give effect to the education initiatives announced by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) in the 1993-94 budget. The initiatives include $3.6 million for developmental funding over three years from 1994 to 1996 to support existing and developing hostels for rural school students, some $5.1 million from 1994 to 1996 for a pilot program to assist in transition support for students with disabilities and $13.5 million to extend the students at risk program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also gives effect to changes to strengthen the Commonwealth's new schools policy for funding new and changing non-government schools. As well, the bill limits eligibility for Commonwealth general recurrent funding to those students enrolled at non-government schools and attending those schools on a regular basis. The minister is given a discretion not to exclude a student where special circumstances apply. I understand that the opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), who spoke previously, mentioned something about that aspect. I am sure the minister will respond to his comments at the conclusion of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also gives effect to the full implementation of the national equity program for schools in 1994 and funding schedules for programs under the national equity program for schools and joint programs to support primary and secondary education for the remainder of the 1993 to 1996 funding period. I will make more comments about the national equity program later. That is one aspect which the minister is to be complimented on. The initiatives in that program involve taking in a number of subprograms under the one umbrella. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill plays an important role in making sure that all young Australians have access to an education. Whether children live in Canberra or in the small village of Uki in my electorate on the north coast of New South Wales, they have access to quality education. One aspect of education which is becoming synonymous with Australia and needs to be reinforced and propped up by governments is that parents can be assured that when they send their children to any school in Australia&mdash;particularly primary students&mdash;they will receive a quality education. The quality of education should not be dependent on how much income the family possesses. It is up to governments, state and federal, to ensure that students receive, as far as possible from a government's perspective, an education that is equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most significant achievements in education since 1983 has been the retention rate among year 12 students. It is now the highest it has ever been. In 1983, only 36 per cent of secondary students completed year 12. Today, in 1993, it is well over the 70 per cent mark, and that is to be applauded. All governments of all persuasions that have been involved in education in that 10-year period are to be complimented for their fine work and for the way in which they have taken on board the changing role of education in 1993. I know derogatory remarks have been made by some&mdash;occasionally for political reasons&mdash;as to how the higher retention rates have come about, although they have not asked why. All major Western countries, including the OECD countries, have found themselves with higher retention rates. Australia is not a follower but one of the leaders, whether we talk about Japan, the USA or any other comparably educated country. The figures speak for themselves. Students are staying at school longer to better themselves. Thanks to government equity programs, they are able to achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 10 years the federal government has committed itself to education to ensure that all Australians, regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic backgrounds, have access to quality education. The government's commitment to quality in education is unparalleled in terms of policy development and funding. The total funding for schools in 1993-94 is to be some $2.9 billion. Students no longer have to leave their home districts to get a quality primary and secondary education. They can be assured of quality education in their own districts. I reinforce the point that it is imperative that the socioeconomic backgrounds of students do not act as a millstone around their necks stopping their development by preventing them from getting a quality education. The commitment&mdash;I speak now as a former teacher&mdash;puts young Australians in a position to meet the challenge for the next century head-on and with confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should be congratulated for its commitment to equity in education. As we brace ourselves to tackle the changing face of the 1990s, our education system is tailoring itself to the education needs of the future. I know that in different states there are different approaches to some areas of education, but we must keep in mind that it is the education of youth that we are about. We should be giving them the chance to participate fully to reach their maximum potential according to their abilities: education is there to service the young of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains a number of programs that ensure equity and access for all Australians. They include the establishment of a pilot program for transition support for students with disabilities; developmental funding over three years to support existing and development hostels for rural students; the students at risk program; and the national equity program for schools. The pilot program for students with disabilities will markedly improve the post-school work and study options for school leavers with a disability. It will include a jobnet service to ensure that school leavers do not lose their skills and confidence if they cannot find work soon after leaving school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program also includes the employment of 80 part-time school liaison officers who will act as a link between schools, teachers, educational institutions, potential employers and employment services. This program offers those students with disabilities a brighter outlook for the future. Students with disabilities, whether those disabilities are physical or mental, are now able to complete their education and enter the work force. Even a few years ago, such opportunities were not available. The government's policy to assist disabled students is creating a future for these thousands of Australians. I believe that such programs have also broken down the barriers and have come a long way in reducing the stigma that attaches to people who are disabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sheltered workshops as such are becoming more a thing of the past and the new supported wage system allows people with disabilities the chance to enter the work force. The developmental funding over three years to support existing and developing hostels for rural students will mean that students in rural communities will be able to access secondary education more fully. The students at risk program, as announced in the budget, will be extended for a further two years at a cost of some $13.6 million. In doing this, it will provide a range of school based projects in government schools with low retention rates. This year it was extended to non-government schools. Whilst there has been some criticism in different states about the amount of funding which is available for the students at risk program, it must not be forgotten that the federal government is not the sole provider of education. It is mainly administered on a state basis, and the states also have to pick up their share of the cost as part of their social input. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The students at risk program provides a range of school based projects in government schools with lower retention rates. The program identifies those students most at risk of not completing their secondary education and encourages their continuing participation by supporting these projects. The sorts of projects included in this program are: improving literacy and numeracy skills; in-service training for teachers to better relate to students at risk and the needs of the students at risk; greater involvement of, and feedback to, parents as part of a student's education; and the development of more flexible school arrangements such as combining school and TAFE courses and part-time study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From personal experience, I know the New South Wales government is increasing the flexibility of school education to incorporate more TAFE courses and the possibility of part-time study. It is making it possible for students to extend their HSC studies over a greater period of time and, in some cases, it might even allow students to compress their studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The students at risk program will go a long way to ensuring that students who have been traditionally ignored by the mainstream education system will have a chance to complete their education. For too long the role of the education system was simply to provide a basic education to students and to skim off a certain percentage and direct them into university. The universities have had 50 or 60 years of that luxury. Now the education pendulum has swung back to being tailored to meet the needs of the majority of students to ensure that, as far as possible, 100 per cent of students enjoy real, obtainable achievements and leave school with skills which will prepare them for their adult lives and form the basis of their ongoing education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of ongoing factors are behind the lower retention rates in schools, such as poverty, students with learning difficulties, family problems and so on. All too often, these problems are caused by external factors which can now be identified by the trained teachers involved and by working together with the parents and the families of students. Students identified as being at risk can simply be assisted and given a greater go. To put it colloquially: simply, it is about everyone being given a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national equity program will be fully implemented in 1994. It will bring together a number of programs to assist both students and schools that are disadvantaged in any way, whether it be by distance or socio-economic factors. The national equity program includes the broadbanding provisions endorsed by the Australian Education Council, which provides financial assistance under four elements focused on access, equity, national priorities and incentives. Incorporated in the national equity program are the school education program, the country areas program and the disadvantaged schools program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The special education program assists government and non-government education authorities and non-government voluntary and community organisations to improve the quality and the availability of educational services for students with disabilities. The funding provides for such things as salaries for specialist tutors and teachers, the purchase of special aids and equipment, and the construction and modification of buildings. More than $65 million was spent last year on this extremely worthwhile program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems facing rural schools are now being addressed and assisted through the country areas program. This program was developed to reduce the educational disadvantage of young children which can result from restricted access to social, cultural and educational services and activities. More than 1,200 schools are assisted annually in the country areas program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government's disadvantaged schools program helps schools that serve students who are educationally disadvantaged due to poverty. More than $58 million was committed to the disadvantaged schools program in 1992, enabling the government to assist more than 2,000 disadvantaged schools and some half a million students. The program has been extremely successful, as completion rates among year 12 students from a low socioeconomic background increased dramatically from some 37 per cent to 61 per cent between 1984 and 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the federal government has certainly given assistance to the state governments through the disadvantaged schools program. It has also built into the program the flexibility which has enabled the state governments to implement the program as they see fit. State governments are the providers of education and, as such, are a little more hands-on than the federal government. The program is implemented by the states in their own manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that, for instance in my electorate where I have a state border as one of my electoral boundaries, there is often a difference in the way the program is implemented in Queensland and in New South Wales. I will not take sides on the matter, but I highlight the fact that, under some of these programs, the state governments are allowed to implement them as they see fit. The increased retention rates for students through to year 12 prove that the programs the government has instigated have been extremely effective in promoting an equitable education system for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also strengthen the Commonwealth's new schools policy for funding new and changing non-government schools. As we move towards the year 2000, the demand for new schools across Australia will continue to grow. In its continual efforts to improve Australia's education system, the government is making a number of changes to that new schools policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1985, the federal government has developed a more cooperative and orderly approach with state, territory and non-government school authorities in the planning of new non-government schools. Applications for new non-government schools and schools making major changes in their operations are considered in each state by a new schools committee or joint planning and coordinating committees, comprising representatives from federal, state and non-government education authorities. Under the changes, there will be a reduction in the regulation of established non-government schools to allow those schools greater flexibility to plan their own development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From this year, the current maximum enrolment requirements in all established non-government schools will be removed. Schools will be expected to manage their development in a way which will ensure their continued viability with minimum enrolment provisions continuing to apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will also strengthen the assessment provisions for new schools and schools undertaking certain changes in operations. The maximum enrolment provisions will apply to these areas. That is aimed at ensuring that the financial viability and curriculum offerings of existing schools are not jeopardised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national curriculum and assessment project, a joint assessment by the Australian Education Council signed in Hobart in 1989, was a move towards establishing a national curriculum. Regrettably, not enough direction and thrust has been given to that project. I urge the federal and state education ministers to pursue more strongly that national curriculum project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way of ensuring national equity is to ensure that people are not disadvantaged when they move from one state to another. Today in the work force, especially in the defence forces and government departments, people are often required to move around the country. Young people are educationally disadvantaged by moving from one state to another. As a federal government, we must ensure that that disadvantage and dislocation is reduced as much as possible. Responsibility for that does not rest entirely in the hands of the federal government and minister; it is very much a cooperative project with the state and territory education ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is imperative that the education ministers act more strongly rather than simply compile a list of national objectives. They started out with such a list in 1989 and they need to pursue those objectives to ensure a greater standardisation in education curricula across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the programs in the bill involve a lot of devolution of administrative responsibility to state departments. As I mentioned in my remarks, the state departments do have a degree of flexibility. That is quite laudable and acceptable. The reporting process, particularly with the national equity program, will also ensure that the results that come from the federal government's contribution are accountable. We can see that the results obtained are in keeping with what the program was put in place for. As I have stated earlier, this bill plays a major role in furthering the government's commitment to equity in education. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1993 is an innocuous sounding piece of legislation. However, a part of this apparently harmless bill has caused many real families and communities great concern. They believe that this bill effectively ends the government's commitment to rural education and abandons its accountability to schools, communities, families and students in rural Australia. In fact, few pieces of legislation have ignited such anger within the regional and rural constituency. It is on behalf of those people that I speak tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among other things, this bill provides for the full implementation of the national equity program for schools&mdash;commonly known as NEPS. The NEPS is intended to align all the Commonwealth equity in education programs under  one framework. Within that framework, the various equity programs will fall into four groupings&mdash;namely, access, equity, national priorities, and incentives. The National and Liberal parties have no fundamental objection to this move as it has been abundantly clear for quite some time that the government's proliferation of education programs was out of control and lacking in direction. No-one, least of all the government, seemed to know where the money was going and what, if anything, was being achieved. In a Department of Employment, Education and Training briefing paper on the NEPS, the department confirms that fact by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every year the Commonwealth invests over $1,000 million directly in schools equity. About $280 million of this is through the NEPS . . . Systems and authorities probably invest a lot of resources in equity programs. But no-one really knows how much is going in, nor what gains are being made. This is a serious situation when you consider how many students are affected and what happens to them when they do not receive effective assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not have said it better. Unfortunately, the NEPS does not seem to address the gravity of the situation. Most of the changes are window dressing&mdash;new names, new headings, a lot of bureaucratic waffle, but not a lot on the ground for those students in need of support and assistance. Some of the initiatives in the NEPS are relatively harmless and some are actually encouraging, including the move towards a rolling triennium funding cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also acknowledge that the government has attempted to improve the data recorded on the outcomes of equity programs. However, this government's obsession with broadbanding, less targeting and more bureaucracy is evident in the most disturbing aspect of the NEPS, which is provided for in part 4 of this bill. It is here that the legislative framework is established to allow school systems at a state level to pool funding they receive for the country areas program and the disadvantaged schools program. These programs constitute the equity component of the NEPS. To allow funds to be interchanged between these two programs would be potentially dangerous and downright illogical. It is for these reasons that the coalition is seeking to have the relevant sections of this legislation referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for further examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No other programs have been broadbanded or combined in this way. For a reason which still remains unclear, the government has decided to combine two completely diverse programs with little in common besides their arbitrary placement under the equity category of the NEPS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disadvantaged schools program is intended to assist schools to improve the educational participation, learning outcomes and personal development of young people disadvantaged by socioeconomic circumstance. Essentially, the disadvantaged schools program deals with the link between poverty and educational outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the country areas program aims to assist schools and communities to improve the educational experiences and outcomes of students disadvantaged by restricted access to social, cultural and educational activities and services as a result of their geographic isolation. Each program deals with an entirely different obstacle. The disadvantaged schools program deals with poverty; the country areas program with isolation. The two programs could not be more opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would have us believe that there is a need to combine these two programs because they serve much the same group of students. It claims that, by combining the two types of funding, schools can take a broader approach to overcoming the disadvantages and obstacles that their students are faced with and maximise usage of these funds. The government is wrong. As I have already said, they are entirely different programs, and they do not generally serve the same groups of students. In Queensland, for example, only eight per cent of schools eligible for country areas program funding are also eligible for the disadvantaged schools program. On a national scale, only nine per cent of schools eligible for the disadvantaged schools program are eligible for the country areas program. The figures speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trying to merge two vastly different programs with vastly different clientele is clearly senseless and unproductive. It is as logical as trying to merge Carlton with Collingwood, Parramatta with Manly&mdash;perhaps you, Mr Speaker, understand that analogy&mdash;or the Broncos with the Raiders. Any Canberra resident would understand that trying to merge the Broncos with the Raiders, even on a football field, will never work because the Broncos always come out on top. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most crucial concern, however, is that by allowing the funding of these two programs to be pooled there is the very real risk that funding for one could be syphoned off to support the other. That is the very real concern that I have and that many people in rural Australia have. Given that there are so few schools receiving funding under both programs, the possibility exists that some schools will miss out. The National and Liberal parties do not regard this as an acceptable outcome. In fact, the government has had this possibility clearly pointed out to it by the task force that it established to consider the feasibility of a broadbanded equity program for schools. On page 20, the report of the task force states, with reference to those that it had consulted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States and systems may also retain funds for system-level initiatives, and respondents were concerned that these were not always in accordance with the needs of, or indeed necessarily found their way to, the designated target groups. As identified elsewhere, respondents felt that broadbanding would make it easier for States and systems to divert funds in this and other ways, to the detriment of the equity groups.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clearly spelt out in that report of the task force. That is exactly my concern and that of thousands of rural families right across the country. They are quite rightly concerned that this bill will enable state school systems to divert funds from the country areas program to the disadvantaged schools program, for reasons honourable or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern tonight is mainly for the country areas program&mdash;in Queensland it is known as the priority country areas program&mdash;as it is the smaller and more vulnerable program and the most important to my constituency. I understand many disadvantaged schools program schools are similarly concerned their funding could be diverted to the country areas program, but I will not delve into that on this occasion. It would be a tragedy if funding for country schools were to be diverted to the disadvantaged schools program. The country areas program provides a range of resources and activities including music, drama, art, sports competition and career education to up to 38,000 students in 260 schools in Queensland alone. Nationally, the program currently assists around 150,000 students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out for the benefit of some of my city based colleagues who are not familiar with the country areas program that we are not talking about providing interesting but generally superfluous activities. We are talking about fairly basic components of schooling which are part and parcel of an urban education. Frequently, schools work together in clusters to employ a communal art teacher or to purchase a minibus to transport students to sports carnivals. They do this because they have no art teacher or no means of transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was never more graphically illustrated to me and to the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and other members of the coalition than when we recently visited remote areas of the Northern Territory and the western parts of my electorate, including Bedourie, and when we travelled up to Boulia and Mount Isa in the electorate of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). In Bedourie, we found that the priority country areas program or CAP had provided a minibus to take students from a school with 13 students down to Birdsville so that they could compete and interact with other children. Without this funding, those students would not be able to involve themselves in those sorts of activities. We are talking about an entire shire where 150 people live in an area twice the size of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The schools in rural Australia do not take their country areas program funding lightly. To many it is their lifeline. It is appreciated, valued and staunchly defended. There are 179 schools in my electorate of Maranoa and most of them are eligible for assistance under the country areas program. I have visited almost all of them in the last 12 months. Some honourable members might find that rather remarkable, but that is a fact. Virtually without exemption, their first words to me have been, `What is happening to the priority country areas program? Why is the government broadbanding it?'. They then invariably proceed to point out the building, the books, the musical instruments, the teacher or whatever it is that the priority country areas program provided. The people of rural Australia are justifiably angry about the government's plan to dissolve the country areas program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government&mdash;and it is a Labor government, not normally known for its ability to listen to country people&mdash;has certainly felt the heat and was recently forced by the weight of public outcry to announce that it will not be part of the federal government's plan to subsume CAP. In Queensland the existing and highly successful arrangements will continue for the time being at least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government would have us believe that, despite the possibility that CAP funds could be directed to disadvantaged schools, we should not be alarmed because each school system will still be required to report to the government on how it has fulfilled its obligations to the equity target groups including the geographically isolated. This does not fill me with great hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is remarkably adept at portraying the most damning performance data as a great achievement. We see that every time a new set of economic figures is released and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) tells us the economy is back on track. One million unemployed and thousands of farmers and small businesses tell us a different story. The country areas program works successfully and hits its target&mdash;a rare achievement for this government and one most certainly due more to the efforts of the people on the ground. One wonders then why the government is forcing such a dramatic change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me most about this proposal is the longer term implications for the country areas program and the 150,000 students it assists. I sincerely hope that this is not the end of the road for the country areas program. Unfortunately, I am not reassured by the broadbanding task force report which contains a particularly disturbing recommendation. Under the section, `Allocation of Funds', the task force, with reference to the CAP index which calculates the school eligibility for CAP funding, recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of the Taskforce's options for broadbanding, the CAP index could be absorbed in the DSP index by adding a weighting for geographic isolation.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that says it all. If this were to transpire, it would mean only those schools that benefit from the disadvantaged schools program and that are also geographically isolated would receive any CAP funding. This is a dangerous and potentially disastrous proposal. I am giving the government fair warning tonight: if that is the future it foresees for the country areas program, then it should think again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I have raised this issue tonight is that I believe it explains the federal government's decision to combine two seemingly separate and diverse programs such as CAP and DSP. The federal government appears to be under the impression that isolation is a problem only for the poverty stricken, that isolation is simply an exacerbating factor for those already socioeconomically disadvantaged. The government is wrong. There is a slender link between isolation and poverty, but it is tenuous. This was revealed by the figures I provided earlier. Nationally, only nine per cent of disadvantaged schools program schools are also eligible for the country areas program. If the task force had its way, only those nine per cent would continue to benefit from the country areas program. What about the other 91 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the families whose students benefit from CAP are not poverty stricken; they are average families who struggle but eventually make ends meet. Primarily, the most daunting obstacles their children face are not linked to income but to distance. It is something the government and its Canberra bureaucracy cannot begin to understand. Families isolated by distance, by inadequate roads and by irregular, non-existent transport services simply cannot provide some things for their children no matter what their financial situation. This is the exact situation that the country areas program identifies and seeks to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no sustainable link between disadvantage caused by isolation and disadvantage caused by poverty. Clearly the government thinks otherwise, so I am warning it now: if the country areas program is subsumed to the point that the only schools which remain eligible for country areas program funding are those disadvantaged schools who also happen to be geographically isolated, then the government will feel the wrath of rural families and communities as never before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not allow the federal government to dissolve the country areas program and, in so doing, absolve itself of all responsibility for the students of rural Australia. We are seeking to have this matter referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training so that the government can see for itself the very real impact of its plans on the 150,000 students whose lives are immeasurably enriched each year by the country areas program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My personal experience in relation to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill is remote. I heard the address by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne). They both come at the matter from entirely different angles. The honourable member for Maranoa speaks from the point of view of the constituents, the consumers of education services and government funding. On the other hand, the honourable member for Paterson comes at it from the point of view of a former provider of professional services.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He speaks for himself, as a consumer, rather than on behalf of constituents who are consumers. Of the two points of view, I suggest that greater weight ought to be given to the views of the honourable member for Maranoa and the opinions of the constituents whom he represents. He comes from an area which is very extensive and in which, according to his speech, there are 179 schools. He indicated&mdash;some members might find it remarkable&mdash;that in the past 12 months he has visited nearly all those schools. I find it extraordinary. It indicates a devotion to his duties beyond measure. It also demonstrates that he is able to speak with conviction and knowledge about the effect of the country areas program. It is an assertion not made lightly; but it gives his views a weight beyond the views of the honourable member for Paterson, whose views as a teacher of 30 years standing are to be respected.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated in my remarks in the second reading debate, the opposition proposes to oppose clauses 3 to 13. These clauses relate to further restrictions to the new schools policy. It has been a consistent part of the coalition's education policy for a considerable time that there should be no restrictions in the form of the new schools policy which has been implemented by the Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from being a new schools policy, it is our view that this is in fact a policy designed to restrict new non-government schools from opening. The hard reality of the last decade is that when it comes to a decision about education, parents have voted with their feet and, in increasing numbers, they have gone from the government system to the non-government system. It is our fundamental belief that both the government and the non-government system of schools in Australia ought to be of the highest quality and that the Commonwealth, as part of that commitment, should maintain its commitment to both the government and non-government systems. As a matter of social justice parents should choose for themselves which schools they wish their children to attend, and we believe that the new schools policy restricts those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present time there is a restriction which in effect means that to open a new school, or change the status of a school, a period of notice of two years is required. The effect of these clauses in the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill before the chamber lengthens the period of notice which those proposing to open a new school, or change the status of a school, must give to the federal government in order to obtain funding for that school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the fact that those new schools tend to be in the outer urban areas of major cities and in large regional centres in Australia, this policy affects the people whom one would have thought Labor would be most interested to protect and whose rights it would seek to enhance. As a matter of social justice, and allowing parents the freedom to choose whatever school they think is most appropriate for their children, it has consistently been our policy that we would repeal and abolish the new schools policy. Consistent with that view, we indicate that we oppose these clauses of the bill which further restrict that access to new schools opening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a couple of letters that I have received with regard to the country areas program, because I believe it is extremely important that the views of constituents on this matter are made part of the public record. There seems to be some confusion on the other side of the chamber in identifying a disadvantaged school. The disadvantaged schools program is intended to assist schools to improve the educational participation, learning outcomes and personal development of young people disadvantaged by socioeconomic circumstances. By contrast, the country areas program aims to assist schools and communities to improve the educational experiences and outcomes of students disadvantaged by restricted access to social, cultural and educational activities and services as a result of their geographical isolation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to read a letter from Mrs Helen McKerrow, whom I referred to in my speech, who resides in Cloncurry in north-west Queensland. In fact, Mrs McKerrow almost lives closer to Singapore than to Canberra. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . For 13 years, PCAP&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the priority country areas program, as it is known in Queensland&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has operated in the North West and in that time it has, with a small amount of funding, made a significant difference to the educational outcomes of geographically isolated students. There is a feeling among PCAP clients that the city-based decision makers do not understand the value of this program to geographically isolated communities nor do they understand the differences between rural disadvantage caused by restricted access and socio-economic disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to quote from another letter I received from one of my constituents in Windorah in western Queensland. It is a letter from Mrs D. Henderson. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PCAP as it operates now, brings the parents, citizens and children of these small outback communities together, which is of enormous benefit for the interaction, cultural and community wellbeing of both the adults and the children . . . I would not like to see the format of the Priority Country Areas Programme changed, as it is working as it was designed in the first place&mdash;for the benefit of all in these isolated areas of Queensland, where our children do not have ready access to these cultural and sporting activities.</PARA>
<PARA>I think those two letters spell out quite clearly the feelings of people in those isolated communities&mdash;indeed the entire community&mdash;in regard to the country areas program, as it is known here in Canberra, and indicate the level of support the program receives. I urge the government to listen to these people, as the National and Liberal parties have done. They will tell the government how the unique administration of the country areas program has brought towns and communities together, united in a desire to overcome the obstacles which isolation has placed in the way of their children's education</PARA>

I urge anyone who doubts the sincerity of those people who wrote those letters, or that of the 150,000 students to which the country areas program brings direct benefit, to visit some of those schools, get out of their electorate offices, get out onto the dusty tracks of western Queensland, the Northern Territory, outback New South Wales, or wherever the country areas program operates&mdash;and it is nearly always in those isolated communities&mdash;</PARA>

The people out there say it is very successful, so why tamper with it? I urge the government and the minister to look at this matter very seriously. The minister's colleagues in Queensland have acknowledged the need to keep it targeted and identified. In fact, the Queensland Labor government is not going to let it lose its identity and be subsumed into other programs in Queensland. It understands the importance of this program.

As such, this bill reflects a normal adjustment in these grants; therefore, the coalition will not be opposing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to refer to a number of matters in relation to vocational education and training which ought to be repeated on the public record. This afternoon in debate on the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill (No. 2), which amends the Australian National Training Authority&mdash;one of the major overseeing bodies for provision of vocational education and training in Australia&mdash;the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) made comments about not knowing, understanding or being aware of the coalition's policy in relation to vocational education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth reminding the minister of some of the principles which were clearly enunciated by this side of the House in relation to vocational education and training. For example, vocational training should be provided in a wide variety of ways appropriate to the range of needs of those seeking training, including the needs of those at different stages of their careers and life cycles. We also said that vocational training should be provided through a flexible and open training market in which the providers are TAFE and higher education institutions, private providers, community and voluntary groups, industry, professional organisations and industry training bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as possible, government funding should be directed to people, rather than courses, to leave maximum choice of provider to the person seeking training and avoid the problems which have arisen from centrally regulated and bureaucratic modes of provision. Those who are currently unemployed should have access to training opportunities which are designed to provide a satisfactory basis for skill development and for entry or re-entry into the work force. Vocational training should not be excessively narrow, but, rather, should aim to provide general skills and knowledge which will encourage adaptability and creativity in the workplace. Finally, the costs of training will be shared between industry, government and students. Our policy will facilitate the expansion of industry contribution to training activities for which industry is to be the beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purport of my remarks earlier in the day was to reinforce those principles of flexibility, responsiveness to  industry and integration into the education system of vocational training in this country. Quite clearly, those principles are still principles which apply to vocational education and training in Australia. Indeed, as I read the report of the Australian National Training Authority to the ministers for vocational education and training&mdash;which was released just this month and which deals with their activities since the establishment of the authority and the directions for vocational education and training in Australia in 1994&mdash;I find support for those principles. For example, in the covering letter to the ministers dated 6 October this year, the chairman of the National Training Authority, Mr Brian Finn, says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In discussions with state authorities and with a range of industry parties, ANTA has identified the following areas as those most in need of review. First, the structures and processes established to plan and implement reform are too complex. This complexity is a major problem and the reform agenda should be brought back to basics, relevant to the needs of industry and students.</PARA>
<PARA>Unless we have a training regimen in Australia which is flexible, integrated with industry and responsive to its needs, then the reality is that no matter what structure we put in place, if it is top down, bureaucratic in its nature, it simply will not be responsive and integrated in that way. Ultimately, it will fail or at least it will not achieve the objectives that we in this country need it to achieve if Australia is going to be internationally competitive. The second point which Mr Finn made in relation to an area in most need of review was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some national initiatives lack focus, specifically the national framework for the recognition of training, while relevant in principle, is not working. Interstate problems with the recognition of training providers, accreditation of courses and an agreed set of credentials are also giving rise to scepticism and frustration on the part of industry.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely the point I was making. When we ask a whole range of people involved in industry in Australia about the training reform agenda, as it has been termed by this government, they scratch their heads and basically say, `We don't really understand it'. We say, `Is there a possibility that you can actually help to employ someone through this system?'. They say, `It's all too complex; we don't understand it'. Therefore, that is the end of the conversation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are real concerns being expressed in industry and in circles relevant to vocational education and training. In fact, they were elaborated on in the report in which the authority said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are growing concerns that the implementation of some of the reforms is not working and that some elements have lost their initial direction and simplicity and have become bogged in complexity and lengthy bureaucratic process. In particular, some of these processes are seen as preventing industry and individuals from getting the training they need when they need it.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, if we have a bureaucratic structure which may look good on paper and may satisfy all the requirements of whatever interdepartmental committee but the reality is that it is not understood in the marketplace, it will not be used. If it is not used we are not providing the training that this country should provide and we are not providing the training that young people and people who require retraining need in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been discussion of late, and some speculation, about whether various states would meet their requirement to maintain effort in relation to vocational education and training as part of the agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. In the pooling of money that the states all provide, there is a condition that at least the amount of money which each state has provided will go back to that state by way of training and that additional growth funds will be provided by the Commonwealth, the proviso being that the states maintain their effort in relation to the provision of vocational education and training. As I said, in recent weeks there has been considerable speculation in some parts of the country that some of the states may not have maintained their effort. Paragraph 1.6 in appendix 1 of the ANTA report to the ministers&mdash;and I believe this report was prepared by an officer seconded from the Commonwealth Treasury&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All states and territories have stated that they will maintain effort in 1994 either in financial or activity terms and have provided data in support of this projection. On the basis of this information the authority judges that all states and territories intend to maintain effort.</PARA>
<PARA>If we turn to the actual assessment that was carried out, we see that it is clear that New South Wales will maintain financial effort; Victoria will maintain financial effort and also the level of activity; Queensland and Western Australia will maintain financial effort, as will Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. South Australia will fail by a small margin to maintain financial effort but expects to maintain the level of activity. It is clear on the basis of this report, which has been prepared for the Australian National Training Authority and therefore submitted to the ministers by the training authority, that all the states will maintain their effort in terms of the provision of vocational education and training as required by the agreement between the Commonwealth and the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there is a proposal that there be a further amendment by the government to the Vocational Education and Training Funding Laws Amendment Bill which, in effect, would allow the Commonwealth minister to direct ANTA not to pay or to pay only a specified amount of the funds provided under the act to any state or territory which, in the opinion of the minister, had not complied with the heads of government agreement on the national vocational education and training system. In light of this proposal it would seem, at this stage at least, premature. I understand that those states which, at this stage, have not technically complied with the agreement have in place legislation to ensure that they do that. Therefore I wonder what the purpose of the agreement is, given that there is a recommendation and a report at this stage to indicate that the agreement is going to be met by each of the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I will say a few words in relation to TAFE funding of libraries. In recent weeks, the TAFE libraries and TAFE colleges around Australia have brought to my attention&mdash;and I presume to the attention of other honourable members and senators&mdash;some details in relation to the level of funding of TAFE libraries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1974 Kangan report, the state of TAFE libraries was described as `deplorable'. In the previous term of parliament, I was a member of the long term strategies committee, chaired by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). That committee reviewed what had happened as a result of the Horton committee of inquiry into the state of libraries in Australia. The long term strategies committee found that very little had been done as a result of the Horton report; that library services in Australia were in a less than ideal state; and that there was a requirement for further funding. I am not sure what the government has done in relation to the report of that committee. I suspect it was very little. It would be a pity if that report went the way of the Horton report because if we do not maintain libraries for educational institutions in this country we are not maintaining those educational institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, schools spent $20 a head on library resources, TAFE colleges spent between $4 and $9 a head, and colleges of advanced education spent between $81 and $147 a head. TAFE colleges have almost three times the number of students of universities, yet universities have 12 times the expenditure on library and learning resources and 10 times the number of learning resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of those figures it is clear that there is an extraordinary discrepancy between the funding of libraries and learning resources for TAFE colleges and universities. Yet there needs to be much more growth in vocational education than in higher education generally. This situation again reflects the emphasis&mdash;inappropriate in many respects, when one makes international comparisons&mdash;that this government put on higher education over the last decade to the detriment of the development of vocational education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures have been provided to me by a particular TAFE college library in Victoria. Based on the standards which the Victorian TAFE colleges have established, the guidelines recommend a core collection size of 100,136 volumes. The learning resource centre, as the libraries are now called, at this TAFE college has only 63,812 volumes, including teaching department items. The annual acquisition rate recommended in the guidelines is $553,412, yet the amount available to be spent on library resources at this college was only $90,000&mdash;not even one-fifth of the recommended amount. </PARA>

From the figures provided by this particular TAFE college, it appears that the provision of resources for TAFE libraries and resource centres is entirely inadequate. I believe some attention needs to be paid to this in expanding vocational education and training in Australia. As I made somewhat more lengthy comments about vocational education and training in the debate on the National Training Authority Amendment Bill earlier this day, I will limit my remarks in this debate so that other honourable members will have an opportunity to speak before the guillotine is imposed. </PARA>

It is part of our future and an area that this government is moving on and needs to continue to move on into the future. When we look back at the technological advancement in our society over the last 100 years, it is clear that the advancement that is likely to occur in the next 100 years will be much greater.

In the times of serious recession that we face at the moment, but now moving towards recovery, we are in a position where the question of opportunities for our young people is very important. The situation in the future is clear: we will not find a situation where there are huge numbers of unskilled jobs&mdash;the jobs that many people were able to rely on when they left school in earlier years. In order to make sure that all of the people of this country moving forward from school into the work force have the skills required to get employment, vocational education and training have to be a crucial part of the way forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This area of the education sector has been the poor cousin to the university sector in the last 20 to 30 years. It has been a sector where business has shown an unwillingness to invest in training. Many businesses see training as an unnecessary expense and something that is up to the government and the education sector to do and they will reap the benefits at the end of it. That is sad because in many respects it has meant that business has not been ready for the changes that have been made in the economy and therefore has not been able to react to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a cultural change required. That cultural change impacts on business and our community. It impacts on the views of our community in relation to education. When I completed secondary schooling some years ago the view very much at that time was that you had to go to university if you were going to have a go, otherwise it was out and get a job. That situation has to change. The move from apprenticeships towards vocational education and training has to occur and it has to be something that the community as a whole sees as being a valued way to approach further education and which kids see as a real option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the overseas experience in this area we find that it is not only an Australian phenomenon. Several OECD studies have indicated that, despite a widespread acknowledgment of vocational education and training's economic importance to individuals and to aggregate economic performance, there was not enough acknowledgment of how vocational education and training contributes to skills, which then contribute to improve productivity and competitiveness. Even though the situation was outlined earlier by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), vocational education and training has greater acceptance overseas but it still has a problem in being accepted as being a way forward for those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question of human capital. Human capital is an important part of the production process. Over recent years the question of capital has been seen as machinery, computers and technology. Although those areas are crucial to the future development of our industry, the human capital element&mdash;the training and the skills of our work force&mdash;are also absolutely vital to our productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's commitment in this area has been clear and has been developed in recent times in a fashion which stands us in good stead for the future. The developing national framework is based on three reports, the Finn report, the Carmichael report and the Mayer report. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) gave an address recently at Tyndale Christian School on this issue. He  said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Finn committee, which was established by the Australian Education Council and ministers for vocational education, employment and training, focused on the growing convergence of vocational and general education. The Finn report recommended the development of an integrated, national entry level training system and the Employment and Skills Formation Council. Carmichael then built on this foundation to propose the Australian vocational certificate training system. The AVC is intended to improve the skills, knowledge and employment prospects of young Australians making the transition from school to further education and training and work. It aims to increase participation in vocational education and training by significantly improving the quality of provision and its relevance to both industry and the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An essential element of this strategy is the further development and implementation of the key employment-related competencies known as the Mayer key competencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision, assessment and certification of these competencies will provide explicit recognition of the core, employment-related, skills possessed by young people: the skills necessary for them to make the transition to further education, training and employment.</PARA>
<PARA>The whole process is based on cooperation and consultation on a federal, state and territory level, with industry, with unions, and with the education and training community. The whole question of cultural change I referred to earlier relies on this. We have to have a situation where this area is seen as a desirable alternative to higher education in the traditional sense or to employment at that time. We have to work towards that and make it happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of government commitment, in 1992-93 the Commonwealth provided a total of $910.05 million for the vocational education and training sector as a whole. The 1993-94 allocation is just under $1 billion at $998.8 million. There is an additional growth increment above 1993 funding levels in 1994 for the Australian National Training Authority to allocate to the states for vocational education and training. Forward estimates provide for a further increase of $20 million in 1995 and, in principle, an additional $20 million in 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 January 1994 we will see the realisation of a national vocational education and training system. From 1 January, ANTA will be fully responsible for strategic planning and funding for the vocational education and training system, reporting to a Commonwealth-state ministerial council. Also, from 1 January, the funding arrangements under the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act will be replaced by new rolling triennial funding arrangements under the Vocational Education and Training Act 1992. New arrangements will see a single pool of funds comprising the previously separate Commonwealth recurrent grants and infrastructure grants which will be passed to the states in accordance with principles agreed by the ministerial council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A total of $630.795 million will be provided to ANTA for this purpose in 1994. This includes an additional $70 million in growth funding above 1993 funding levels. In 1994, real capital funding levels will be maintained. Allocation of growth funding to states and territories will be conditional on agreement with ANTA to pursue specific national strategies. Up to $27 million will be provided for national projects in the areas such as equity, industry needs and quality provision. States and territories will have to specifically identify their spending of Commonwealth grants on adult literacy. Up to $5 million will be provided to support interstate cooperative projects which increase student places through, for example, more flexible modes of delivery. A total of $630.8 million will be provided under the Vocational Education and Training Act 1992, which is an increase of $78.6 million over what was provided under the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1989 for the calendar year 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of national programs in 1993-94, skill centres will get $5.583 million. This will involve catalytic funding for industry based skill centres and catalytic funding for enterprise based skill centres to be managed by tripartite management committees consisting of industry, union and government representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of national curriculum development, currently over 100 curriculum projects are under way. In 1993-94, they will continue to be focused on priority industries, such as metals and engineering, rural, automotive, aerospace, building and construction, road transport, printing, food processing, manufacturing, information industries, electrical and electronics industries, and health industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of traineeship development grants, $1.335 million will be provided to improve training materials for traineeships, both for those under the Australian traineeship system and career start traineeships. Basic training manuals will continue to be produced by the Commonwealth, with a greater emphasis on competency based training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to the training guarantee levy. Part of the government's overall vocational education and training agenda concerns bringing a cultural change in industry, particularly to industry's view of training. A 97 per cent compliance rate is a pleasing indication that a lot of employers have already moved to a greater emphasis on training. Another feature of training is that it is meant to prevent skills theft. Basically, those employers who have been responsible and far-sighted in meeting their training development needs have in the past been subject to poaching from other employers who have not had the same visionary outlook. Pushing along this line creates hope for avoiding that sort of thing occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simplification of reporting requirements that was recently announced will reduce problems in relation to accountants, et cetera, preying on confused employers. This will be achieved through the two-year averaging technique. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vocational education and training, as a future direction for this economy, can and must work. The criticism that is often made is that we are training people for jobs that do not exist. In some respects, when we are looking at training needs for the future, this will always be a problem and this argument will always be raised, particularly in times of high unemployment. But we have to make those training changes for the future. We have to look to that future and the jobs that have not yet been achieved or discovered. But they will come, as they came in the past in industries that, 10 or 20 years ago, we never thought would provide large-scale employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not look at a situation where skills development will necessarily lead to massive job loss. An example of a study of technological modernisation is the Swedish banking industry, which predicted a drop in employment of 10,000 workers over five years on the basis of capital labour substitutions in other sectors. Instead, the result was an employment increase of 10,000, due in large part to dramatic job restructuring and training, adaptation, moving forward, developing the niche aspects of those industries and, in that way, improving productivity and, in many respects, job opportunities. The piloting process for the Australian vocational certificate is under way. I will again read from the minister's speech on the issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present there are 68 institution-based pilot projects testing the implementation of the AVCS in schools and TAFE. 3,700 students will participate in these projects which form more than half of the 111 projects which have been approved for funding in a first round of AVC pilot projects.</PARA>
<PARA>The other 43 projects are work based. The work based pilots will provide employment and training opportunities for approximately 2,200 trainees. All these pilots have been developed through a cooperative national process involving the Commonwealth, state and territory governments, industry, unions and the broader education and training community. That is the way to go for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we face the situation of having to adapt. We have to move forward and develop ourselves to meet the needs of our region and the future. As we look to that future, we can see great change in relation to the labour market and the international economy. We have to adapt to those changes. A key way to do that will be through vocational education and training. It is not the only way. But if we do not do it through this sector, the overall success of this government&mdash;which I believe will be successful in this area and with this economy&mdash;will not be as good as it once might have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to take note of that training need by working towards it nationally, cooperatively and consultatively. We have to ensure that industry is onside and is part of the process. We have to ensure that the TAFE sector and other aspects of the vocational education and training field support this process and are a party to it. If those people who are crucial to the actual development of a new system and its operation are not supportive, it will be sadly lacking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The indications are encouraging. The signs are that the change can be made, that the sector is flexible and adaptable to the changing needs and can develop, as it has developed to an extent in recent years, programs that are required for the new labour market we now face. I am confident that the sector can do so and I am confident that we as a government, through budgetary and legislative matters and through our overall vision in this sector, can make the required changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look to overseas experience. We have to look to the needs of the international economy and how that will impact upon us. We have to make those changes regularly and develop a sector which is able to do that on an ongoing basis. That will require funding and cooperation. It will require organisations such as the Australian National Training Authority to oversee it. It will require much of the vision shown in the Finn, Carmichael and Mayer reports. It will develop a situation where the people of this country who in the past were often in low paid and unskilled work are capable of adapting and learning to move into areas of new skilled development and where people are recognised for the skills that they have rather than the qualification they might have. We have to ensure that the development of the system incorporates that. We have to achieve the cultural change that I spoke of earlier. We have to be in a position where we all move together on that basis. We can do it. We are doing it. This legislation is a part of that and I commend it to this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Vocational Education and Training Funding Laws Amendment Bill is interesting. The crowd in the chamber numbers seven people plus a couple of Labor Party supporters. For the benefit of listeners, I would like to paint a picture of what is happening out in the world instead of the rather narrow, bureaucratic presentation of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin). He ran through the whole gamut of expenditure that can be easily read from the explanatory memorandum. I would like to speak about what I find in the area that I represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major educational change rests on a couple of key areas in our community. These key areas are, firstly, middle managers who have lost their jobs and must redefine themselves in the workplace. They have to reskill and relearn a lot of things that they thought they would never have to learn. Often they have spent 20 to 25 years carving out a niche for themselves in the workplace. Upon redundancy they find they have to reskill and retrain. It is not an easy process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of people with difficulties are those at the younger end of the spectrum who have very modest academic achievements and for whom the educational system offers nothing whatsoever. In fact, they try to run away from formal education by staying on until year 12 in a course they cannot handle. They then enter the workplace at the age of 18 with a poor pass in the higher school certificate and with no ability to attract much support from an employer. Those young people are ready candidates for the unemployment queues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The next group includes those who leave school at the earliest possible age to avoid the rigours of school life. They drift from unskilled job to unskilled job, never chalking up a record of consistent employment, being occasionally employed or, unfortunately under the policies of the current government, never employed. I also see people who range across the age groups and who have few or little skills. These people are referred to as the victims of changing technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate we have all of these victims of the terrible policies of the federal Labor Party.

Surely the honourable member does not come to this place so unobservant and so uncaring for his electorate that he does not acknowledge the record high unemployment in Australia. We have this uncaring attitude being expressed in this House by members of the Labor Party. It is no wonder that the budget program acknowledges that there is not going to be any change in unemployment levels during the next 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) is also uncaring about unemployment levels. If the minister does not think the solution to unemployment is partially educational, then he should not be in his job. If he does not think part of the problem is a lack of education and a need for new direction in education, then he is wrong. What we need is a change in processes for the educational services of Australia. This applies from evening colleges through to university level. In part these bills try to rectify those problems, but it is a bureaucratic driven process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In private enterprise there is cutting edge stuff being done in educational services and educational change that the minister does not even recognise or know about. Even the government's low level programs of vocational skills, whether they be in skillshare or in jobs clubs, are let to private enterprise. Is the minister aware of that? No. He has never heard of those programs. He has not been involved with them. He does not recognise the low level education process that starts the kick-on for somebody wanting to climb the ladder of success that can lead from evening colleges or private education to TAFE or universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The integration of this process is part of what is advocated with these bills. They are welcome changes. For instance, the Australian vocational certificate is something that starts to put building blocks in place for achievement and recognition. I acknowledge that. But there is much more that needs to be done. It is time that the minister and his government recognised that there is much more that they can do, there is much more integration that can take place, and there is much more innovation that should be searched out and adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact the government got it half right 12 months after it should have taken action of this sort, and probably two years after the whole of the unemployment-educational mix became obvious to anybody in Australia&mdash;obvious, that is, except to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Day after day the Prime Minister says in this place, `She'll be right. The glass is running over. This is the one that will bring home the bacon'. Again today the Prime Minister said that the recovery is on the way and that we do not need to worry about jobs problems because he has solved the jobs problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not right, and it will not be right for a long time. We cannot live on the polemic of the Prime Minister because it is falsely based. The Prime Minister should know that, but every couple of months he says that we are at the point of recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to look now at the development of greater flexibility and the need for greater integration between educational services, whether public or private, at the TAFE, technical college or university level. The secondary education system is presently supplying a greater number of vocational skills than it did previously. Part of the problem students have in applying this greater number of vocational based skills is that they are not always relevant to the needs of the workplace. The integration of workplace needs with the schooling system is something that governments&mdash;federal and state&mdash;have been trying to cope with for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some welcome changes as state governments have struggled to make the last two years or additional year of education more relevant to the workplace. It is hoped that, with further development of the Australian vocational certificate, there will be a recognition of what can happen in the secondary education system. We have not fully explored that yet, but I believe that the integration of secondary schooling and TAFE is a significant step in the advancement of the Australian vocational certificate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an overemphasis by government on government systems. Introducing a better vocationally based system to the secondary school system, noting the advice of voluntary services and professional groups in our community which assist the development of school based curricula, and identifying vocational opportunities for final year students are all things not yet fully recognised and explored by many state governments and which will need further development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next level that needs attention is the mix of evening colleges&mdash;which is often referred to as recreational education&mdash;and TAFE. Evening colleges in Australia are offering a wider range of courses, and many of these are career oriented&mdash;they are not purely a matter of recreation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the demand for courses in computer literacy was highlighted by a survey of 2,000 businesses in the electorate of Mitchell. Those businesses outlined the sorts of people they want to employ. Two thousand of them responded to the question: if they were to put on another person, what sorts of skills would they want from that person? The overwhelming response was that every person they employed from now on must have keyboard and computing skills; they must be self-sufficient to some degree. Businesses are no longer prepared to employ computer professionals or keyboard operators as support services. They want people who can be self-supporting&mdash;who can find their way around a computer keyboard with the simplest word processing packages or the most common database packages. That was the overwhelming response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second highest response from these businesses was that they lacked people with interpersonal relationship skills. They cannot find people who can relate to others, whether they be people in the workplace or clients. I see nods of agreement in relation to that. Neither the minister nor the government has sought to identify how these sorts of skills can be best developed. These are the skills that drive private enterprise. They create opportunities and jobs, produce better sales and service, and inspire a will for excellence. They provide the best opportunities for Australian businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does our education system cope with these sorts of nebulous demands? The fact of the matter is that the education system is not coping with these sorts of nebulous demands. The only places even slightly catering for the demand&mdash;I believe that further development is needed&mdash;are the private education and evening college sectors, where short courses of 12 weeks to a year provide basic keyboard skills for people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The courses provide only basic skills, but employers say that they want basic information. At the moment, there is no recognition of that as a starting point for a more complex computer course. We have a demand out there that the system is not meeting, and because the system is not meeting the demand, the job creation process is not as great as it could or should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area that I want to deal with relates to mature middle management redundancy, which is so much a part of my electorate. There is a lot of pain, and counselling is needed for people who find themselves, after a career of 15 to 25 years, suddenly out of work. Their expectations have suddenly been crushed. They have been removed from the whole system of their profession or their area of expertise by the flattening of the hierarchy within an organisation so that the steps between the base of the pyramid and the top are reduced. People in middle management are the ones who are squeezed out in that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These middle managers, male or female, tend to be married, they tend to have teenage kids and they tend to have mortgages. Suddenly, they find that a major component of family life and its wellbeing has been removed. How can those people get back into the work force and become a productive part of our society, drawing on their experience and knowledge?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Mitchell electorate we have found it very difficult to find appropriate courses for that sort of person. Attitudes are part of it because there is a degree of reluctance to admit lack of knowledge and lack of skill. There is even a reluctance to admit an incapacity to prepare a resume. These people have not prepared resumes for many years, so even that basic skill is lacking. To capture a new skill, maybe at a lower level, is something that I believe the educational services of Australia need to be aware of. They need to go out and capture, design packages for, and draw on the expertise of this group of people. It is not happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where will it happen? TAFE&mdash;technical and further education&mdash;has a degree of flexibility that is almost unbelievable. It is capable of designing courses and providing accreditation. We are on the verge of a very exciting development in technical and further education.

<PARA>I would like to outline the background to and purpose of these amendments to the Vocational Education and Training Funding Laws Amendment Bill 1993. The amendments are being introduced as a precautionary measure pending implementation of all the essential elements of the new training arrangements based on the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA. In particular, the Commonwealth is concerned that most states and territories have not yet introduced the complementary legislation which heads of government agreed would be necessary to give full effect to their July 1992 agreement on the national vocation education and training system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments provide that, if the Commonwealth minister determines that a state or territory has not met its obligations under the 1992 heads of government agreement, the minister could direct ANTA not to pay any or only a limited amount of Commonwealth funds to that state or territory. This new power is tied explicitly to the provisions of the heads of government agreement and could not be used by the government to impose additional requirements on the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In introducing this legislation, there is no intention to undermine the ANTA arrangements and there is no criticism of the operation of ANTA itself. Indeed, the objective is to ensure that the ANTA arrangements are put on a firm footing by ensuring that the states and territories meet their obligations from the outset. For this reason the legislation provides that the new power to withhold funds would be available to the Commonwealth minister only until the end of 1995. There would be no ongoing power for Commonwealth intervention in the allocation of funds through ANTA. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum for these amendments to the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to the comments by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) in relation to these amendments. The minister has indicated that part of the agreement between the Commonwealth and the states pertaining to ANTA involves the introduction of complementary legislation on the part of the states, that that remains to be done in some instances and also that there is a requirement that the states maintain their efforts in relation to their provision of vocational education and training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier, the report of the Australian National Training Authority to the ministers for vocational education, under a covering letter of 6 October, indicated maintenance of effort after analysis had been complied with in relation to the states. If the report of the National Training Authority is to be accepted by the ministerial council and the minister, who is at the table, the purpose of this particular amendment can therefore only pertain to the introduction of complementary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will not be opposing the amendments here, but I will take the opportunity later to look at them in more detail. I am not thereby indicating that that would necessarily be the position that we would take in another place. My only concern in reading the crucial clause of the amendment, namely 14A(2), is that, whereas the minister in his earlier comments referred to Commonwealth funding, that does not seem to be a limitation in the clause itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the ministers at their July meeting had agreed to a resolution in relation to the process of transfer of funds between the states and territories and the Commonwealth. In their resolution, the ministers expressed a preference for a notional transfer arrangement between the states and territories. If that in fact is the transfer arrangement, then the matter which I am raising by way of precaution does not arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if there is the possibility that it could relate to all funds transferred to ANTA, then there might be some concern as to the scope of the amendment on the part of the states. I highlight that. If the minister is able to assure me that that is not the case, then he will relieve a concern which arose from my listening to what the minister had to say and reading this particular clause. Apart from that, there are no other matters which I wish to raise in relation to this particular amendment. </PARA>

Hopefully they will arrive at some point during the debate so that they can take note of the important questions that I intend to raise on the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the explanatory memorandum, the bill is designed to give effect to a number of measures announced in the budget amending the Social Security Act 1991. They are, first, to increase the rate of payment for certain newstart beneficiaries; secondly, to apply the family payment income and assets tests to student parents; thirdly, to reduce the income ceiling and assets test limit for basic family payments; and, fourthly, to limit arrears of family payment. I welcome the parliamentary secretary into the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been the government's wont on these matters, the government has mixed a number of benefits which it has provided for some persons with other reductions of quite a significant character. In the context of this debate, I would like to draw to the attention of the House the changes that have occurred&mdash;in particular, the adverse nature of those changes&mdash;that affect many individuals who were undoubtedly unaware of the impact that these decisions might have on them at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first measure is the increased payment for certain newstart allowees. That provides a $3 per week increase in the rate of newstart allowance for single people only. As I understand it, those who are married and have dependent children already receive a higher rate. The recipients of this allowance have to be aged between 21 years and 59 years and not have dependent children or, if they are aged 60 years and over, not have dependent children and not have received a social security benefit continuously for at least six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that some 253,300 newstart allowees will benefit from this measure each fortnight. This is in addition to some 31,700 recipients who will benefit from this measure under schemes administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. That is a useful extension of benefit, but it ought to be understood that it does not cover&mdash;this point should be noted in relation to this particular question&mdash;the increased costs of living which most unemployed people have experienced as a result of the 1993 budget. When one includes the sales taxes, the fuel excise and the other cost of living increases it is a fairly mediocre sum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the parliamentary secretary mean that, as a result of the greenmail, there may be some additional benefits? The fact is that the government's intention was not to provide that benefit. That ought to be clearly understood. The government was not interested in social justice. It had to be bludgeoned into it. The benefits that the parliamentary secretary now claims would be available to the wider class of people are only possible because of the decisions that we took in relation to the budget, which put the greenmailers, as I have seen them referred to, in a unique position in dealing with the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These budget measures have also been designed to dovetail with other initiatives that the government has taken. I, along with the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), have been with ACOSS this afternoon. I know that one of the matters it was very concerned about was the government's decision to introduce activity testing. We dealt with that last evening, and I would not want to reopen debates, but in relation to those tests, which the government did not announce and did not see fit to put in any of its policies before the last election, the government expects to get some 30,000 unemployed people off benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the people who will come off benefits will be those of a non-English speaking background, those who are more disadvantaged and less able to understand the complexity of the provisions. The government will put the secretary of the social security department in a position where he will be able to take people off benefits if they are not complying with activity agreements. Activity testing is designed to save money and get people off benefits. </PARA>

There are no savings unless people come off benefits. Activity testing was designed to take people off benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is requiring the unemployed to engage in nefarious tasks without finding them jobs. That is what it is involved in. It is a very clear situation of what I would call studied inactivity on the part of this government. The government is not dealing with long-term problems of unemployment; it is simply creating hurdles over which the unemployed have to jump in order to get their benefits. That is what we are seeing in relation to the way in which the newstart allowance and the jobsearch allowance activity testing is being undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This benefit may help address some of the increased costs that the unemployed will experience. The widening of it in relation to others under greenmail may assist others, but that was not the government's original intention. We know that of the order of one-third of all unemployed persons have been unemployed now for over one year and one-half of these people have been unemployed for over two years. The long-term unemployment problem is expected to worsen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the studies that have been undertaken by the government's own agents. I refer, in particular, to a paper by Richard Yetsenga, Maureen Maclachlan and Meredith Edwards of the Economic and Policy Analysis Division of DEET, who are very critical of the government's policies in this area. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given current policies, it is likely that the level of very long term unemployed will continue to increase over the next few years . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The paper continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the levels of very long term unemployed people we can expect in the next few years are a cause for concern, and we believe they are, then what is needed are policies that effectively target this group . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to that group which has been unemployed for two years or more&mdash;176,000, nearly one-fifth of all those who are unemployed&mdash;the number of very long-term unemployed has increased from 34,000 in April 1980 to that figure of 176,000, which is a five-fold increase, and largely achieved under a Labor government. Is it any wonder that I call this studied inactivity? At the moment we are waiting for the government to get around to having a further report from the committee on employment opportunities. It postponed its reporting date. At this time we have no immediate solution. All we have got, even with that report being sought, is another excuse for further inactivity on the government's part. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say I was somewhat shocked yesterday when I attended a seminar conducted by the Parliamentary Library on this question of social justice. There was a report from an organisation that the parliamentary secretary's department is involved in supporting the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales. I want to quote from that report of its principal, Mr Peter Saunders, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poverty, inequality and recession</EMPHASIS>. On page 19, in relation to this question of inequity, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it does appear that, among families at least, the recession which began in 1990 has worsened income inequality, possibly by a considerable amount. And it needs to be remembered that this change has come on top of a substantial period&mdash;probably extending back to the mid-seventies&mdash;during which income inequality has been steadily increasing.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the sorts of comments that I think are particularly germane to these observations that arise when the government increases by such a modest amount the payment to certain newstart allowees. It is not going to address their social inequality. It is not going to address their comparative disadvantage.

I have extracted a list of 11 items&mdash;initiatives that were first outlined in Fightback&mdash;which have either been adopted or which were unannounced changes and commitments which have been put in place for the purposes of saving money, which the government had clearly been working on and developing but did not see fit to include in any of its policy statements before the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to look at them: increasing the women's pension age from 60 to 65, another one of those right wing proposals which are hostile to fundamental Australian beliefs; another is the stricter jobsearch and review activity for both the jobsearch allowance and newstart. They were born in Fightback. We walked away from them because the unemployment situation had not improved, but those in the government, as soon as the election is out of the way, adopt them in their entirety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see it again in relation to the requirement for eligible pensioners to claim an overseas pension before claiming the Australian pension. We had not even thought of that one. It involves another $33 million of savings. There are people who will be disadvantaged by that because they will not be eligible to get the benefits that might attach to their overseas pension that they would get if they were in receipt of an Australian pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are the students turning 16 who will have to remain on the additional family payment rather than being able to transfer to Austudy. It is a matter we discussed last night. There is the inclusion of certain employer provided fringe benefits as income under the income family test. There is the issue of the family income test being applied to student parents, one of the matters we are dealing with in this legislation. Then there is the reduced income ceiling and assets value limit for the basic family payment which takes out 116,000 families from the basic family payment as a result of reducing the income ceiling. That is one of the initiatives we outlined in Fightback and which the government characterised as being `radical right wing proposals which are hostile to fundamental Australian beliefs'; then it includes them in a bill of this sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the limiting of arrears in relation to the family payment. This will limit 25,000 family payments where arrears might have arisen because people had inadvertently not been able to claim family payments at the date when they first became eligible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, is it not, that we are dealing with eligibility for family payments. During the National Family Summit on 11 November 1992, it was the Prime Minister who said:</PARA>

I have received correspondence&mdash;I dare say the parliamentary secretary and the Minister for Social Security have received similar correspondence&mdash;from students who are concerned because they are in the middle of their courses and have been paid certain benefits under the Australian Postgraduate Research Awards for undertaking important higher education study here in Australia; research often designed to benefit this country. People are now being told that the family payments, which were part of their award conditions because they were not tested against this, will no longer be payable to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One student rightly complains that the benefits he may lose as a result of the passage of this legislation could cause him to have to discontinue his PhD because he had budgeted upon the receipt of certain income over a three-year course between 1993 and 1995. He made his financial commitments on the basis of that total income package, and he is now not in a position to meet them. I dare say that the parliamentary secretary would say that that is also a matter of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was moving by legislation to ensure, by specific words, that the right of certain people or a principle in administrative law was overturned. The parliamentary secretary pointed this out in his second reading speech. He had to make reference to it deliberately and draw it to our attention, just as, similarly, the legislation had to deal with that matter. It is contained in clause 18 of the bill which deals with certain determinations which are not to be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply note that the parliament, particularly through the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, has seen fit to draw our attention to this matter. It is a particularly important matter. The committee notes that the proposed amendment does diminish rights preserved by general principle of law. The committee draws that matter to our attention, as it says that it may be considered to trespass unduly upon personal rights and liberties and thus be in breach of the committee's terms of reference. The opposition will not be pressing the matter in relation to that question, but it is important that people know when the government is proposing changes of that sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, this legislation marks Labor's day of shame in relation to social justice because it is the last piece of legislation dealing with unannounced substantial changes in eligibility for benefits which were not foreshadowed during the last election. I regard it as a grave breach of good faith with the electorate every bit as bad as a broken promise. Every statement given to a minister as a minister, which he knows he intends to give effect to, in my view, ought to be included in his policy program and commitment so that people can make an honest assessment of his legislative program. </PARA>

It will not impress people who are paying taxes, who support the welfare system and who want us to run a decent, honourable, fair system where people operate under the same rules.

These are the poor! These are the people that he is wailing and gnashing his teeth about whom we have ignored and neglected&mdash;people with assets of over $550,000!

I do not doubt that when we are debating the fringe benefits tax he will tell us to ignore those. He will tell us to let senior public servants in South Australia get family payments because they can get fringe benefits rather than income. He will tell us how terrific it is that people who run companies can somehow manipulate the system to get Austudy in full. He will support all these things.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, but it is not disorderly to take a point of order. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) addressed this House for 20 minutes, allegedly on the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. It would possibly be of benefit for me to draw to the honourable member's attention the three main changes to the bill. They relate to: an increase in the rate of the newstart allowance payable to some single people over 21; a reduction in the income and assets tests thresholds for certain family payments; and the making of certain family payments to persons previously receiving the payment not recoverable. So there are three relevant aspects to this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), in a speech which I thought was very interesting and very much to the point, proposed an amendment asking that this House condemn the government for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)its failure to inform the Australian people of its intention to apply the basic family payment and assets test to student parents, reduce the income ceiling and assets value limit for family payment, and limit arrears of family payment; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)the inequity of the Budget which treats low income earners in a harsher manner than high income earners, and its failure to maintain a fair and equitable income distribution parity; and, further,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)its inability to deal with the problem of long term unemployment, and the consequent social dislocation.</PARA>
<PARA>Over the last few months and in the run-up to the election the government has not come forward with its true agenda. We have seen that true agenda unravelled slowly but surely over the last six months. We have seen the election promises which said that the government would deliver to us a great Australia, an Australia which would be fair to all with no new taxes. We all know what has happened in the budget and we have all seen increased taxes after increased taxes. While we are not allowed to use the word `lie' in this place&mdash;and I certainly would not endeavour to do so&mdash;we have seen that the people of Australia now see the taxation situation confronting them as being quite different from that which they had anticipated, given the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the first point raised in this legislation relates to the increased rate of payment for certain newstart allowees. While apparently about one-quarter of a million of Australia's unemployed will benefit to the tune of some $6 a fortnight by this measure, it should be remembered that a further three-quarters of a million Australians are receiving some form of unemployment benefit. They are on the dole scrap heap as a result of this government's policies and they currently have little hope of improving their financial situation and standard of living. This measure does not solve the problem; it does not improve the lot of three-quarters of a million Australians whose plight has been forgotten. The tragedy of unemployment continues to stalk these people who have no hope as a result of this government's policies and certainly no hope offered by the bill before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should be focusing on this major problem of unemployment and the creation of real jobs&mdash;jobs which will benefit Australia's economy, Australians and the families of those one million people who have been thrown out of work. The $3 a week increase for single people without dependent children who receive the newstart allowance will be welcomed by that small section of the community who will receive it. But what these people really need most and what they are entitled to is the opportunity to turn their backs on newstart and jobstart allowances and enter or re-enter the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment remains one of Australia's most pressing problems. There really should be a multipartisan policy. It should not be a matter on which people score political points, because the tragedy of unemployment cuts right across the social spectrum. I can see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca). I know that he has a real concern in this area. Like me, he must have been terribly disappointed over the lack of budget initiatives to create opportunities for Australia's one million people out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the bill before the House, while helping a small number of people, contains stop gap measures which help a minority of people but which ignore the problems suffered by the remaining people who are out of work. One ought only to look at the continuing unemployment situation and the month by month figures. While the number of Australians receiving newstart and jobstart fell marginally last month, it ought to be seen as only a slight improvement. The tragedy of unemployment continues for a very large number of people, most of whom want to work. The reason for the small decline in unemployment is that many people who wanted full time jobs have had to be satisfied with part-time employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some parts of the electorate of Fisher, the situation is very grim. The number of people on newstart and jobsearch allowances paints a very grim picture. I refer to the major urban centres in my electorate. In Caloundra, 2,520 people are out of work. Kawana Waters has a jobless rate of over 1,800 people, which increased by a staggering 16 per cent during August. In Caboolture and on Bribie Island, the unemployment rate increased marginally during September, bringing the number of people on the unemployment benefit to 4,159. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the wider Sunshine Coast-Caboolture region, there are almost 17,000 people in Labor's job queues. Given the opportunity of an extra $3 a week, as promised by this bill to a quarter of those people, or an opportunity to start back in the work force&mdash;an opportunity to have a job and provide a future for their children&mdash;very few people in the dole queues would not take the opportunity of full-time work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his amendment, the honourable member for Berowra has condemned the government's proposal to extend the family payment and income assets tests to student parents. Many of those people have undertaken their current studies on the basis that certain benefits are available. While the government might well have an argument that payment ought not to be made to some of those people, we on this side of the House, and indeed many reasonable people opposite&mdash;if there are any left&mdash;disagree. I can only see one person on the government benches, and that is the parliamentary secretary. I know that he is reasonable on many occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, it is quite unfair that there is an element of retrospectivity in this legislation. People who have possibly given up work to undertake further study on the basis of receiving certain benefits to assist them to complete that study will be disadvantaged. Given the current economic climate, it could well be that they will be unable to find work. They might have to give up their studies, and their lives could well be destroyed. We are talking about fairly piddling amounts of alleged savings in this measure in view of the overall budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I understand that the savings are a mere $0.4 million in 1993-94, $0.8 million in 1994-95 and the same for the following year. While it could be that only a small number of families will be affected by this measure, I think it is something that the government ought to look at again. If there is only such a small amount of money involved and a small number of families who will be affected by this measure&mdash;which, to a large extent, could well be deemed to be retrospective&mdash;then the government might well take on board the idea of scrapping this particular measure at least as far as the retrospective element is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two other matters I mentioned when I commenced my speech: the reduced income ceiling and assets test limit for the basic family payment and the limiting of family payment arrears. The last three measures were not foreshadowed in the election campaign, and so people voted for the government. It cannot be doubted that the election was won by the government and not by us, despite certain allegations made by honourable members opposite, but sadly the government did not give notice to the Australian people that these measures were coming in, and, in fact, a lot of people would have voted for the government believing that these measures would not be included in the bill before the House. Had the government come forward with its actual program, a number of people in a number of electorates might well have voted against the government, with the result that the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) could now have been the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) could now have been living elsewhere&mdash;in the south of France or somewhere else beyond our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the government has misled the Australian people in relation to some of the measures in this particular bill. I must say also that it is very hard morally to justify removing the right to claim arrears in the area of family payments. If the government or the bureaucracy has made a mistake and has wrongly denied someone the opportunity to claim moneys which legally are claimable, it seems a bit rough to limit the arrears. That is quite unfair. The whole idea of this measure is not a desire to be fair to those involved, but rather a desire to remove people from the welfare system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be very important that discretion is exercised in this regard, because it could well be, through no fault of the particular person involved, that the necessary notices of changes of address have not been passed on to the Department of Social Security and someone could well miss out on family payments as a result of a wrong decision of the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wishes to proceed with these matters before the House and if it wishes to make the savings outlined in the material which it has distributed, then possibly those savings could be used to treat Australia's pensioners and retired people, in the area of managed investments, in the same way as the parliamentary secretary and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) have agreed to treat the deeming of shares. I hope the minister will take that on board. I know that I have written him innumerable letters as have almost all honourable members on this side of House and, I suggest, honourable members on the other side of the House. It is probably a matter that the parliamentary secretary would like to have happily resolved, but to date, despite his efforts in that area, there has not been a satisfactory resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to reinforce the wording of the amendment before the House. The opposition does not oppose the general thrust of the bill. That was stated by the honourable member for Berowra in his excellent speech a few minutes ago. What we are doing is condemning this government. We are seeking to have this House condemn this government for its failure to inform the Australian people of its intention to apply the basic family payment income and assets test to student parents, reduce the income ceiling and assets value limit for family payment and limit arrears of family payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also condemn the government for its inequity in the budget, whereby low income earners are treated in a harsher manner than high income earners. We condemn the government for its failure to maintain a fair and equitable income distribution parity. We further condemn the government for its inability to deal with the problem of long-term unemployment and the consequent social dislocation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the months leading up to the election, the Australian people were treated&mdash;and I use that word loosley&mdash;to a list of promises from the government. The government promised us that somehow Australians would have a great future without any new taxes. From the time of the election on 13 March through to now we have found that these promises have been shredded one after another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, when we look at the opinion polls, which show that this government is totally disregarded by the Australian people, that this government is being totally rejected by the Australian people and that the ratings of this government are almost nonexistent, we can see that the Australian people are demanding honesty in politics, integrity in politics, and ethics in politics. Quite frankly, the message that is coming into my office&mdash;and I know that it is coming into the office of the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) and all of the people on this side of the House&mdash;is that people want another election soon. They want the opportunity to confine this government to the political scrap heap of Australia. They want to confine this government to the history books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is the worst government that Australia has ever had. It is a government which is bringing in policies which are not favourable to the Australian people. The people of Australia want an opportunity to throw this government out. On behalf of the electorate of Fisher, I call for an election as soon as possible. I encourage those in the other place to reject as many measures as possible to force this government back to the Australian people so that it can be held to account for its conduct over the past seven months. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make two comments. There really is not much that one needs to rebut in terms of the opposition's discussions here tonight.

Frankly, it was a bit of filibustering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention the position mentioned by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). He talked about the new enhanced activity tests that we are bringing in for certain jobsearch allowees. The position, as he puts it, is that a lot of disadvantaged clients, including migrants and Aboriginals, will be thrown off the queues. The reality is that these new enhanced activity requirements are being done for exactly the opposite reason than the one he suggests. We are trying to have earlier identification of people who will be at most risk of being long-term unemployed; we are trying to ensure that we have proper case management; and we are trying to ensure that these people get the special attention that they deserve, rather than having to serve 12 months on the jobsearch allowance before they sign an activity agreement under the newstart arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition continually whinges about the fact that we did not supposedly give notice about these matters before the election. It is pretty obvious to me that those opposite have been out of government now for so long that they do not understand or they have forgotten the process that takes place when budgets are formulated. The fact is that these matters are discussed at length in the lead-up to the budget. Some matters are excluded; some matters are brought in. Spending proposals and savings proposals are discussed, as a result of which a lot of these measures have been brought in, particularly those that we are bringing in today. One would have to be an absolute goose not to go to the population and say at election time, `We are not going to increase the newstart allowance by $3 a week', as we have done. That has been fairly well canvassed by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the last hour we have again been debating the merits of the Labor Party's love affair with socialism and the desire to treat the Australian people as a collective rather than as proud individuals. It is not for the Labor Party to reward industriousness; nor will it recognise those who want to work hard for their country, their families and themselves. No&mdash;the Labor Party just wants it easy. Every time an Australian wants to get ahead, he or she is bashed over the head by the Labor Party's notion of democratic socialism. In other words, base everything on the lowest common denominator and work against those working to improve their lot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Labor Party is based upon mates. They are mates in everything they do. It is Australian mateship that holds us back. It is the mateship that gave us the tall poppy syndrome. Mateship that gave us the award structure where good workers get the same as poor workers, for it is impossible to reward good workers under the mateship award structure. Mateship sees us as one of the least productive countries in our region. It is mateship that derides anyone who says that we are sucking up to the establishment if we are taking a caring attitude towards our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party and its paternalistic mateship withholds the development of women in our society. It encourages a breaking down of our family unit and it encourages collectives where the individual can be sacrificed for the group, the mates. They say in the Labor Party that we are all just great mates and we look after each other and stuff the consequences of everything else. Now we see the collective nature of their mateship move into the social welfare area of our community. Whose idea was it within the Labor Party that `if everyone is on the government payroll they will never vote us out'? Who was that purported great Australian, that great political misfit, that great charlatan? This government is moving slowly towards achieving the goal&mdash;all mates together on the payroll and stuff the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is, though, can the country continue to support this notion of Labor collective mateship? The answer is simply no. As we continue to spend more as a government than we attract as income we will surely go further downhill. The only way governments can attract income is through tax, and we are now one of the highest taxing countries in the region. Yet what do the mates say?  They say, `Let us keep spending. The world will get us out of it. The money will never have to be paid back. Who cares about debt? What can they do?'. This totally irresponsible attitude towards finance and the future of our country is typical of the sanguine mates of the Labor Party. They have no financial responsibility at all. They just have a spend, spend, spend attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One hundred years ago we were the envy of the world. We had the opportunity to lead the new world with development and lifestyle. Yet once the labour movement wreckers got hold of some power they began ripping us apart. Mateship Labor Party style has a lot to answer for and it is time for us Australians to care about the future of our country and for the visionaries to take a more responsible attitude to the way we go about helping the community and encouraging growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To quote the words of the Parliamentary Secretary for Social Security, (Mr Sciacca), the Labor Party is committed to the Australian family. This is rubbish, absolute bunkum. Spending is not a commitment. Giving taxpayers' funds away to the privileged few is not a commitment. Commitment is ensuring proper health services, not unrealistic queues for hospital care. Commitment is supplying education as an opportunity, not making it impossible to place children in preschool centres or universities. Commitment is ensuring a strong economy based on growth, not increasing our debt to buy services we cannot afford. Commitment is giving financial security to those who want it by providing the environment for full employment, not regulating and destroying wealth creators. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The defended island continent of Australia and the homes of the middle class were also built on denial&mdash;the historic denial of the prior occupancy of the Australian continent by the people who became known as the Australian Aborigines, and of the brutality and lawlessness with which their land had been taken. White Australia's continuing fear of invasion must be seen as a massive collective projection of the knowledge of white Australia's origins.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I would like to congratulate you and your committee on the recommendations concerning televising the House. I am pleased to see that your recommendations coincided exactly with my own submissions to the committee. The government was extremely unwise not to accept the recommendations, both politically and in principle. Its refusal reinforces the public view of the government as isolated and arrogant and it is going to further erode the faith of the public in parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter what sophistry the government mounts to justify guided democracy, what it has done is to cut across the public's right to know&mdash;a right that the public now demands in all aspects of government, and a right that is fundamental to democracy, particularly when the public is paying $3 million a day for this institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, much of the debate earlier today was beside the point. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) argued the indefensible extremely well, but his argument was paternalist and about fears more than reality. It was an argument for censorship and protection of the public that would be well received in Jakarta but not in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) put the partisan view and detailed many defects of honourable members, the media and the way the place is run. But rather than suggest remedies, he simply took the view that these problems should be hidden from the public. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) gave an extremely good exposition of the ultra-conservative position about the virtues of the Westminster system and a member's duty to parliament, but he did not mention our duty to the public. In essence, he put the antiquated view that parliament is sovereign, whereas I think that the vast majority of the community believes that the people should be sovereign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), while taking the correct view, spent most of his time on a sidetrack with a partisan conspiracy theory about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The point is that, no matter what the defects of this institution are and no matter how honourable members or the media may misuse their position, all proceedings of this parliament should be open to the public. The many problems that exist should be addressed directly and not just hidden. Of course there will be problems from a fully open system, but they will be minor compared with the problems that flow from any form of censorship or secrecy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that television has enormous power; it is information at its strongest. It caused the collapse of communism. The footage of the point-blank execution of a prisoner by a South Vietnamese officer was the turning point of the Vietnam War, just as the scenes of the Dili massacres have turned around the Timor question, and the TV coverage of dead Americans in Somalia has altered American foreign policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advent of television into this House in 1991 will inevitably be a major factor in the constitutional reform which will take place over the next decade. The people's perception of parliament has already altered irreversibly, even though much the same things have been happening for the past 75 years. The government is deluding itself if it thinks it can continue to prevent the public realising the way parliament is run, or if it thinks it can continue the executive dominance of parliament that has existed in the past. The government places itself in the same futile position as the diehards of the Chinese government who still believe that the nightly electronic jamming around Beijing will keep ideas out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate has also thrown up further reinforcement to the brutal fact that the Senate is now the people's house. The Senate's less restrictive position on television access, its more representative membership and its freedom from executive dominance is making this House less and less relevant. How can the government, with its endless rhetoric about the need for change and micro-economic reform, justify separate rules for radio, print and television and separate rules for both Houses?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spectacle of the Labor members of the committee reversing their committee position and voting against their own report just demonstrates how party interests always come before public interest, and how very little can be debated in this chamber except in terms of partisan advantage. It has underlined yet again that this House is just a rubber stamp for the executive. The government may have forced its Galileos on the committee to recant on this occasion, but the attempt to restrict public access is doomed to failure in the long run. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature and political character of the so-called `president's team' or the `old guard' was clearly indicated in the New South Wales parliament on 16 September this year when Mr Michael Photios, the Liberal member for Ermington and a state government minister, said that the president's team:</PARA>

<PARA>that is, by Mr Photios&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and that will be overwhelmingly re-elected again this year&mdash;again after a great deal of work by me and my colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious why a state Liberal minister would make such an effort. A former old guard chairman of the NRMA acknowledged that he had been a member of the finance committee of the New South Wales Liberal Party. Prior to the 1990 federal election the old guard-controlled NRMA contributed to a $3 million national partisan political campaign against the incumbent federal Labor government; a campaign which could only benefit the coalition parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are great concerns about the propriety of the current ballot for the NRMA. We may be witnessing a deliberate ploy to confuse voters. In the first place, another R. Talbott suddenly emerged as a candidate in the elections for which the prominent MAG member and retiring councillor, Richard Talbot, is also a candidate. Normally, both names would have appeared as R. Talbot and R. Talbott&mdash;the new candidate's name being spelt with a double T. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, Mr Nick Hullah, the returning officer, is alert to these tricks&mdash;one will be identified as Bob Talbott; the MAG director will be identified as Richard Talbot.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remember . . . cross six boxes only or your vote won't count.</PARA>
<PARA>That is wrong. The board of directors purported to change the voting system to require crosses as late as June this year, despite the fact that the method of voting is provided for in the articles of association. Ever alert, the returning officer has overturned this rort by advising candidates that he will accept crosses, ticks, numbers or similar marks, provided they give a clear indication of the voters' intentions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many NRMA members have complained that they have not received ballot papers. What a shambles! If the NRMA cannot conduct an election, how can it run a multi-million dollar business operation? The NRMA old guard is also using the branch depot network to distribute its how-to-vote tickets. The proprietors of those depots are intimidated into accepting the tickets for distribution. This practice, of course, has been going on for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also clear evidence that the appointment and reappointment of NRMA directors to NRMA subsidiaries is being used to intimidate and discipline those directors in the pursuit of what the directors see as their legal and moral obligations to NRMA members. In a letter to Mr Richard Amery, the shadow minister for consumer affairs in New South Wales, dated 7 October 1993, Mr Ray Willing, the chief executive officer of the NRMA, referred to some alleged actions by Mr Richard Talbot of the Motorist Action Group and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was as a result of this sort of conduct that he was not reappointed to the board of NRMA Travel and NRMA Open Road.</PARA>
<PARA>The candidates for the Motorist Action Group, contesting the NRMA elections, represent a balanced team: Jane Singleton, NRMA director and chair of the Australian Consumer Council; Richard Talbot, NRMA director and highway surveyor; and Geoff Lawson, NRMA director and international cricketer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to point out the increasing need for education institutions in regional centres of Australia and to voice my strong support for two groups in the Sunshine Coast-Caboolture area striving with success to improve tertiary education opportunities for people living in the region. The Sunshine Coast area, as many members would be aware, is among the fastest growing regions in the nation. The electorate of Fisher, which includes Caloundra city, Caboolture and Bribie Island, has the highest population growth rate. Since 1986, the population of Fisher has increased by a staggering 41.4 per cent. Neighbouring Fairfax is ranked third in the growth stakes with a population increase of 38.7 per cent over the same period. Fisher and Fairfax, however, are also listed eleventh and ninth, respectively, when ranked according to the highest rate of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the electorate of Fisher is ranked fourth in a field of 147 in families with an average annual income below $16,000. Less than eight per cent of the Fisher population has tertiary qualifications. In summary, Fisher is the fastest growing electorate in Australia, yet one of the poorest and least educated at a tertiary level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the electorate of Fisher has one of the lowest per capita incomes for families Australia-wide, it is extremely difficult for many residents to travel to obtain a tertiary education. One only has to look at the fairly terrible statistics on those students from the Sunshine Coast and Caboolture areas who have applied for tertiary admission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, 7,000 students applied and only 2,000 were accepted, leaving 5,000 who were unable to find tertiary places. This year, taking into account the growth rate in the Sunshine Coast-Caboolture area&mdash;a growth rate of eight per cent&mdash;it is anticipated that there will be 10,000 applicants for about 2,000 places, leaving 8,000 students unable to find places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was therefore with delight and some relief that I welcomed the news in late August that the Sunshine Coast University Association had been successful in its bid to have an independent university established in the region. It should be noted for the record that the chairman of the committee is Mrs Alison Kerr-Jones, the joint deputy chairman is Dr Professor Melvin McMichael and the other joint deputy chairman is Professor Frank Kelly, the father-in-law of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). The committee members are Peter Campbell-Kerr and David Friend. The university, to be based at Sippy Downs, is expected to open in 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a committee in Caboolture, sponsored by the Caboolture Shire Development Association, working for the establishment of a university in the Caboolture Shire. A university campus in the Caboolture Shire would service residents living in the southern areas of Fisher as well as the northern suburbs of Brisbane and the Brisbane Valley.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having regard to the way in which the area of Caboolture is growing, I am very pleased to lend my support also to the Caboolture Shire proposal in addition to the proposal on the Sunshine Coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is widespread support, both within the Caboolture Shire and from local authorities around Caboolture, for the Caboolture Shire university proposal. The present and future population in the core student catchment zone establishes a requirement for a university campus in the Caboolture Shire. I have been advised that the current population in the core catchment area comprising the Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Kilcoy shires and Redcliffe City currently exceeds 212,000 people and will exceed more than 350,000 in just over 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal submitted by the Caboolture Shire Development Association covers the projected population growth, identifies a number of sites for the campus and outlines opportunities for making the campus a viable option, such as promoting the university as an exporter of education. Given the local demographic trends and trends in participation in higher education and training in general, it is both logical and economic that appropriate learning centres are established in the Caboolture Shire sooner rather than later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two universities would complement each other, provide employment opportunities and improve Fisher and Sunshine Coast residents' ability to access tertiary education. Education provides the key to the future for many Australians of all age groups and generations. I am therefore strongly supportive of these groups which are endeavouring to lift the level of education and provide access to education for people living in the Sunshine Coast and Caboolture regions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to talk about the perpetuation of myths and inaccuracies that occurs in this House and in the media. I refer to the use of the term `terra nullius'. It has been said in this House&mdash;very often by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;that it meant that no people occupied Australia. It, of course, never meant that. It never had that connotation. It refers to `no use of the land'. It has been held by the Supreme Court in the United States, by the court in Canada, by the Privy Council and previously by the High Court of Australia that occasional traversing of the land by nomadic peoples did not constitute use of the land. For the High Court, therefore, to say that Australia was not terra nullius, overturning 200 years of established belief, was simply historically incorrect. Australia was terra nullius because it was terra nullius after the fact. It was created that way by the government. One has to look at the way in which the British operated in their colonial domains. Everywhere they went, they sought treaties. That is why Malaysia, India, New Guinea, New Zealand, Fiji and North America are covered by treaties&mdash;treaties which have their own problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, instructions to Captain Phillip were to sign treaties with the inhabitants of Australia. The fact that he did not do so was because he could find no-one with whom to sign the treaties. I think it is the height of arrogance for the High Court to say that it, 200 years later, could have done better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think judges do have to consider their position. If judges take it upon themselves to dictate laws, they will find themselves increasingly becoming part of a political battle, in danger of being held in contempt by the public. If the public lose faith in our judicial system, they will be in danger of being defied and our stability as a nation will be threatened. In the end, it is in the best interests of the judges themselves to take their responsibilities to the majority of Australia seriously. That is what I am asking them to do&mdash;to consider their responsibility to the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take the example of the High Court Mabo judgment, we will see that the majority of justices put themselves above the general public instead of being responsible to it. There is talk about the common law being the vehicle for social justice. The common law of course was never such a vehicle. The common law was a body of law established for the good governance of society. As such, it is inappropriate to stand common law on its head. Common law should be an evolutionary thing, not a revolutionary thing. The High Court has decided to make it a revolutionary thing and upset 200 years of established practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else might be said about judgments? Some of the language, particularly from Justices Gaudron and Deane, was highly emotive, including the phrase `unutterable shame' in respect of past treatment of Aboriginal people. By doing this, they symbolically separate themselves from that history and absolve themselves from the blame. They can see the shame so they are pure. People who can test their version are, by implication, part of the society and process which they condemn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that this unutterable shame does not prevent the justices drawing mammoth salaries and associated perks which would not be possible without the Aboriginal dispossession which so exercises their conscience. The Chief Justice receives $191,550 per year. Other justices receive substantial amounts too&mdash;$174,122 per annum, courtesy of the Australian taxpayer. Although the High Court sits in Canberra, only one justice lives there. The others jet in from other cities and are paid a Canberra allowance of $18,108 a year for their troubles. How much of their salaries and perks has each justice personally donated to Aboriginals? It must be nice to be able to parade a social conscience for such a lucrative return while society in general bears the consequence for this show of high mindedness, quite apart from the consequences&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The bank changed its logo in September 1991 as part of a broader program to introduce a new "corporate identity" and to recognise a new corporate structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The previous logo was designed in 1960 and research had suggested that it had become outdated and was putting the Bank at a competitive disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The new logo and corporate image have provided the Bank with a modern competitive image and have led to direct efficiency gains.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Research showed the Bank's traditional yellow and black colours were very popular and well known. Accordingly, the focus of the identity program was to be a vehicle to display these colours to advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shape chosen has its origin in the stars of the southern cross and thus it is synonymous with Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The old logo was a map of Australia surrounded by three circles and the words "Commonwealth Banking Corporation".

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8)&amp;(9) Public and media response has been very favourable to the new logo and corporate identity, so much so that the Bank has not seen the need to verify this formally with market research.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr Beddall</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am aware of the remarks made by Mr McMahon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The new parallel runway will allow Sydney Airport to meet forecast demand into the next century efficiently and within acceptable limits of delay. It is expected that by the years 2005/2010 the new airport at Badgerys Creek will have been developed to a standard capable of accepting a significant proportion of airline traffic in the Sydney region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential for any significant delays after the parallel runway becomes operational will be influenced by the scheduling practices of airline operators. The airlines' present practice of `cluster' scheduling is contributing to the delays currently being experienced. The airlines are currently examining the possibility of establishing a Schedule Co-ordination regime for Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(a) There will be changes to flight paths when the parallel runway is opened. These were discussed in the EIS for the runway. In accordance with the Government's decision on the runway project, the new flight paths are now being refined in consultation with the local community as part of the Environmental Management Plan being prepared for operations with the new runway. There will be no departures to the north from the new parallel runway and the east-west runway will only be used when adverse weather conditions preclude use of the other runways for safety reasons. The result will be a marked reduction in the overall number of people seriously affected by aircraft noise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) No. The Government is committed to retaining the curfew at Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. Peak period pricing has been introduced at Sydney Airport to alleviate congestion and to increase the efficiency of use of airport facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Partly in response to peak period pricing, the regional airlines in NSW have rationalised their services to and from Sydney Airport. For example, there has been a trend to the use of larger aircraft for regional services to Sydney. This has been made possible by regional airlines adopting `hub and spoke' type networks where small feeder aircraft concentrate traffic at major centres for on-carriage to Sydney by larger aircraft. Another development has been the adoption of `triangular' routes which serve more than one country centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As about 38% of passengers from regional carriers interlined with major carriers at Sydney in 1992/93, it makes sense to continue to cater for these operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years the proportion of light aircraft movements at Sydney Airport has declined. With the exception of regional airlines, light aircraft comprised 9% of aircraft movements during 1992/93.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) As far as I know, no spokesperson for any other major air carrier using the airport has publicly expressed views which would corroborate the comments attributed to Mr McMahon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Government's position on the suggestions made by Mr McMahon is reflected in my answers to questions (2), (3) and (4). No further action is proposed at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Construction of the initial general aviation airport at Badgerys Creek will commence later this year and the airport is expected to be operational in 1995. Subsequent stages of development will be in accordance with aviation demand and the commercial viability of further investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises the importance of ensuring that potential opportunities for services to the new airport are not overlooked or unreasonably constrained. The Government therefore asked the FAC to examine the opportunities for the early commencement of international air freight services at Badgerys Creek and the viability of bringing forward subsequent stages of airport development to cater for these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC's report on this issue is expected to be available shortly. The Government will then be in a position to consider the implications of advancing the rate of airport development at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
