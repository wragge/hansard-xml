<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If he is quoting, as I assume, the Secretary of the New South Wales Labour Council, he misquotes him, because what the Secretary of the New South Wales Labour Council was addressing himself to was, quite specifically, a matter relating to the treatment of long service leave. In relation to that particular quote, he was referring to long service leave. The Leader of the Opposition might recall an incident back in 1978. I am sure the absent honourable member for Bennelong would certainly remember a similar instance when he proposed a similar measure at that time. Of course, the government of the day subsequently changed part of what it was proposing to do in that area. But if the Leader of the Opposition is trying to make a point about some of our critics, he might at least get their quotes right.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Finance aware of some criticism of the budget on the grounds that it does not provide enough for employment growth through infrastructure expenditure and for the unemployed through various outlays? What is the government's budget strategy regarding infrastructure and other spending as it relates to employment and the unemployed?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="413" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen various comments from commentators and from more direct participants in the political process about the fact that this budget contains nothing for the unemployed. That is a complete misstatement of what is in this budget. This budget has a very direct focus on the unemployed, both in terms of getting back to employment growth and providing assistance to people who remain unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole shape of the budget was to provide a stimulus to demand through about one-half per cent of GDP&mdash;something which the opposition says that it totally opposes but then ironically proposes policies which would accentuate that position. The shape of the budget is to give a stimulus to demand so that we can get the economy going at a faster rate and get to the point where the rate of growth of employment will make inroads into unemployment. The very shape of the budget is directed towards increasing employment and, therefore, towards looking after people who are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget contains a boost to Commonwealth investment expenditure. There have been some quite wrong reports that this budget cuts back on infrastructure expenditure. That is untrue. This budget has a considerable increase in Commonwealth investment expenditure because the One Nation expenditures are running at full bore, because there are other infrastructure expenditures, and because some of the public trading enterprises are increasing their investment. Commonwealth investment will increase by about seven per cent in real terms in this budget. That is a major factor in public final demand increasing by some 2 1/2 per cent in real terms against 1 1/2 per cent last year. That 2 1/2 per cent increase in public final demand puts about one-half per cent directly into GDP growth this year. So let us have none of this nonsense about this being a budget which does not have infrastructure expenditure to create employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is support for business investment. There are measures to cut company tax and to provide for the investment allowance on top of the One Nation proposals for the depreciation allowance extension and the development allowance. We are seeing major encouragement to business investment with the result that business investment this year is expected to increase through the year by some 10 3/4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment is expected to increase this year by 1 1/4 per cent. That represents about 100,000 jobs. We want to create a lot more jobs, but it is a turnaround from the situation of the last couple of years where employment has been going backwards. We are now back on an employment growth path of 100,000 jobs this year, with the forecast of 2 1/2 per cent growth for the following year and 2 3/4 per cent growth the year after that. We are directly on track to meet the accord obligation of 500,000 jobs over three years. Comments from some quarters that the budget does not deliver on that accord obligation are dead wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To try to assist that process, there is more action in relation to labour market programs. This year 66,000 more people are assisted under labour market programs than was the case last year&mdash;66,000 more. Is that doing nothing for the unemployed? We also look to take action to assist those who remain unemployed. There is a $6 a fortnight increase in the newstart allowance for the long term unemployed. Furthermore, we have relaxed the income test for unemployed people so that they can earn more whilst they are on benefits without having their benefits impaired. There are a couple of measures along those lines. We also eased the waiting period for people who are employed for only a short time and who then become unemployed again. These are all substantial steps in assisting people who are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another step is the mature age allowance, which provides pension-type benefits for unemployed people who are aged 60 years and over. That is a considerable benefit for those elderly unemployed persons. Finally, all of the unemployed people benefit directly from the Commonwealth dental scheme, which provides both free emergency and basic dental care to all pensioners, beneficiaries, and low income families. The opposition tries to totally ignore that in looking at this budget. That is a considerable benefit to all lower income people, including the unemployed. Various people who should know better, including various people in the gallery and various people in marginal parties in another place, are dead wrong when they say that the budget does nothing about the unemployed. This budget is very concerned both to create jobs and to ease the position of those who remain unemployed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Prime Minister indicated on Friday, and as I indicated on Wednesday, we have listened to what the Leader of the Australian Democrats has had to say to us and we will speak with her again. The government has considered its position in that context. It was always the case that the budget measures had to be such as to be approved by the Senate. The point that I was making last week was that this was a budget for four years; it was a budget which involved a deficit reduction strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not quite sure why the opposition would be asking a question like this. The opposition has rendered itself totally irrelevant to this discussion or any discussion about the budget, its objective, or even the course of fiscal policy for this nation over the next few years. If we look at what members of the opposition have to say on the budget and on the deficit reduction strategy, we see that they will make the deficit $3 billion higher than the government proposes by 1996-97. That is the only conclusion that we can draw from what the Leader of the Opposition had to say in his reply and from what his shadow Treasurer had to say in his remarks to the National Press Club last week.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mayo will resume his seat. The Treasurer is in order.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will say this slowly for the honourable member for Mayo. The reason I made those remarks was that the Senate had to realise something which the opposition has failed to realise: what the government is concerned about here is getting a credible fiscal strategy for the next four years. What has happened is that the approach of members of the opposition to fiscal policy has become so flaccid that they think nothing of adding an extra $3 billion to the deficit in 1996-97. But it is worse than that because the honourable member for Mayo has said that they were not proposing to decimate the budget, they were proposing to change 1 1/2 per cent of total revenues. He said, `This is the same as what the Senate did in 1981'. First of all, 1 1/2 per cent of revenues is about $1 1/2 billion. The opposition is proposing $3 billion worth of changes which he says is the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member wants to go for this current year. What happened in 1981, if he wants a little lesson in history, was that three proposals were raised by the then Treasurer. One was to increase all WST rates by 2 1/2 per cent, to correct some anomalies and inconsistencies and to broaden the WST tax base for goods which previously had been exempt. The combination of all the measures constituted 1.4 per cent of revenue at that time. The first and second of those measures were passed by the Senate. It was the third which did not pass. That was a measure to raise $132 million in 1981-82; that is, 0.3 per cent of revenues. So, as far as the honourable member for Mayo is concerned, there is no difference between 0.3 per cent of revenues and 1 1/2 per cent of revenues. It is no wonder the opposition is in such disarray on fiscal policy, if its primary spokesman on the topic does not understand the difference between these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially what the honourable member for Mayo has said is that he wants to see the deficit lower but he wants to knock off the measures which are going to achieve that objective. As well, when pressed on the point of how he would do it otherwise, all he could talk about was tax reductions. He wanted to reduce taxes. When he was asked what he would do about deficit reductions he had nothing to say&mdash;because the opposition has no policy in relation to fiscal policy. Indeed, it has no policy about anything whatsoever.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="416" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have, indeed. Among others, the Leader of the Opposition a week or so ago said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Think about your own kids and the difficulties that they have had getting an education . . . compared to how easy it was for most of us. It is a lot harder for them . . . to get an education with 60,000 kids that cannot get into university.</PARA>
<PARA>I will deal briefly with the time that the Leader of the Opposition and a few others of us in this House were lads. At that time only two students in 10 who started secondary school completed year 12. Now, eight in 10 complete secondary school. Two in 10, when the Leader of the Opposition was a kid and eight in 10 young people today. Then there were 91,000 people attending university; in 1993 there are 575,000 in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comparison with the 1960s is so absurd that it does not bear continuing to talk about it in this House except that the Leader of the Opposition feels obliged from time to time, as he repeats each year the speech which he gave the previous year on the budget, to reiterate the line that is tapped into his computer. As he goes through that computer and spits out the last year's budget response, he is obliged to give it a run again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take a more modern comparison than the 1960s; the circumstances we found when we came into office and the circumstances which now exist. In 1982, out of every 100 kids who started secondary school, 16 made it through to university. In 1993, 28 out of 100 make it through to university. In other words, the chance of any young person completing school and going on to university has increased by 75 per cent since the Australian Labor Party came to office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only two out of 10 children completed secondary school in the 1960s. In 1982&mdash;repeated Liberal governments later&mdash;the figure was only three out of 10. The figure today, as I mentioned earlier, is eight in 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These improvements in opportunity are now reflected in the skills of our labour force. In February 1981, 7.7 per cent of the total labour force had degrees. In February 1993, 12.3 per cent of the total labour force had degrees. In 1981, less than 31 per cent had some other form of post-school qualification. In 1993, over 38 per cent did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be providing, via this budget, an extra 31,000 higher education places between 1993 and 1995. We have provided an additional $720 million over three years to expand the vocational education and training system. We have provided an in-principle commitment to a further $70 million in growth in vocational education in 1996, subject to the states meeting their obligations under the ANTA agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the Liberal Party offer as an alternative to fulfil the words that the computer of the Leader of the Opposition keeps spitting out at each budget time? What is the opposition's position? The opposition spokesman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Opposition would retain its existing policy on education until a wide-ranging review could take place.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that he intended to spend the next 12 months seeking the broadest possible opinion before formulating a new education policy outline to put before coalition members. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`I'm fairly keen not to pre-empt anything although at this stage I think it's fair to say that we're in a situation where much of the current policy would be open to review'.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed it should be. The Leader of the Opposition comes into this place and accuses a government with a massively successful record in the area of education of being in some way dilatory. Despite the fact that he has been Leader of the Opposition for two or three years now and is supposed to have a policy in this area, he has none at all.</PARA>

<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition sits there, protected by his apparatchik mates at the conference, doggo, cowardly. He is now prepared to contemplate the thing that was going to be divisive a few weeks ago. Listen to the proposition that was put:</PARA>

If the budget debate is met and we have kept the Opposition leader longer than his natural political life, then it has served us well because the Leader of the Opposition will never win a national election in this country.

Incidentally, the honourable member deserves some congratulation for having organised, in cooperation with the Latrobe Regional Commission, an exhibition of considerable importance in this parliament last week. The honourable member also makes a great contribution in chairing the regional development work of the caucus. The government has elevated regional development to a first order priority, and that, I think most honourable members in the chamber would accept, has not been a position that has obtained since probably the Whitlam period. The first of the raft of government initiatives is the establishment of a task force on regional development, chaired by Mr Bill Kelty. It is now working very actively around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to an article in last Wednesday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> by Sonia McCallum headed `Daikyo slams racist accusations&mdash;federal MP's comments a litany of lies', in which the former government member for Leichhardt and now the senior general manager of Daikyo (North Queensland) Pty Ltd, Mr John Gayler, accused me of indulging in baseless accusations of preferential treatment to Japanese tourists on Green and Fitzroy islands. I want to assure Mr Gayler and the House that at no time were any of my comments intended to be or were they in fact racist in nature, nor were any of my remarks `lies' as he suggests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As any reasonable person would, I welcome tourists from all around the globe, as well as appropriate levels of foreign investment. However, like my constituent and others before him who raised the Green Island issue, I have made the point publicly&mdash;and I repeat it&mdash;that Australian sovereignty should not take a back seat to either of these essential national aims. I do not resile from anything I have said and I would hope that Mr Gayler would refrain from such comments in this newspaper and on ABC radio. </PARA>

<PARA>The customs and excise tariff proposals which I have just tabled contain alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and the Excise Tariff Act 1921. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alterations contained in these proposals operate on and from 1 September 1993. They give effect to the government's decision to increase the excise rate of duty on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene by 0.264c per litre, as announced in the federal budget on 17 August. These changes will enable the Civil Aviation Authority to recover part of the cost of aviation safety regulation from the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs Tariff Proposal No. 10 (1993) also contains an alteration to include Eritrea in schedule 1 to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. This follows Australia's formal recognition of Eritrea as an independent country on 4 May 1993. Prior to this date, Eritrea was part of Ethiopia. The inclusion of Eritrea in schedule 1 to the Customs Tariff Act accords that country the full benefits of the Australian system of tariff preferences. Summaries of the alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have a government that is generous when it comes to guilt-speak, in damning the alleged misdeeds of our forefathers, and one that can describe a mean and deceitful budget as doing the decent thing. But it is strikingly lacking in compassion and in basic understanding when it comes to the 100,000 retired Australians who have invested in shares. The facts are breathtakingly simple. From next month pensions stand to be reduced, not because the recipients have received additional income but because the paper value of their shareholdings has increased since September 1992. It matters nothing to this government that the shares may have been purchased at a higher price and that they have been registering a nominal capital loss since the date of purchase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has no understanding of the motivations of small investors. It proceeds on the ignorant collectivist assumption that the stock market is a giant lottery where the punters scan the newspapers for the right moment to seize a windfall capital gain. It does not wish to understand that so many Australian shareholders have no interest in speculative gains but hold shares in blue-chip industrial companies that provide them with a fairly steady and modest dividend income. Such investors are often likely to sell their shares only in the event of a takeover, and to them the whole question of nominal gains and losses is an irrelevance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is striking a blow against a prudent form of self-provision. If nest eggs are not invested in shares, the alternative of putting money out at interest exposes retirees to massive fluctuations caused by government manipulation of interest rates. There is clearly something wrong in combining a steady income with the protection, rather than the windfall enhancement, of the original capital. This government apparently does not want retirees to retain capital. Shares in reputable companies are one of the safest forms of saving, but one that apparently is to be denied to elderly Australians who may require additional income support from social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a massive inconsistency in a government that proclaims the virtue of superannuation as a form of retirement income and then introduces policies that penalise effective and responsible saving. Yet with the habitual changing of superannuation rules, the increasing propensity of this Labor government to tax fund income and the removal of incentives for private superannuation, we can ask why Australians should not be allowed alternative means of self-provision. Savings in a blue-chip company may well be more secure than in a superannuation fund whose trustees are subject to less rigorous obligations than company directors, and where underperformance and insolvency can be real possibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standard, slipshod defence of this mean attack on retirees' savings is that those with substantial resources should not receive public assistance. Why is it then that, of the 100,000 pensioners affected by this move, only 1,500 have shareholdings valued in excess of $100,000 and their removal from the pension system will save only $5 million? It is a hallmark of a government that knows it has made a bad decision, but lacks the courage to admit its mistake and return a measure of social justice to the pension income test, that it should reduce the rate of pension withdrawal by 50c rather than by each dollar of unrealised gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a supposed compromise that admits error but does not alter the basic problem. It simply illustrates that the government lacks the courage of its own convictions. How ironic also that this very budget, which will fund recurrent spending by selling $1.5 billion of Commonwealth Bank of Australia shares, in effect is saying that elderly Australians, who may possibly require some kind of pension assistance, need not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, this Labor government wants to confine share ownership to the rich and to the corporate sector. We may ask just how successful privatisation share floats will prove if the savings of older Australians are excluded. Retired people need and deserve a degree of certainty in the management of income. So many people in the Pearce electorate who are affected by the legislation on unrealised gains understandably seek to remove the problem by selling all their shares. They cannot afford the risk that they will at some stage face a serious pension reduction caused by a sharper than expected revaluation of their shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The action of the government is, in short, guaranteed to encourage all affected retirees to abandon the stock market altogether. The consequence will be that the realised capital will produce only meagre interest income when invested, and stands to be rapidly eroded by the new round of inflation that the government has now unleashed. A further consequence will be a sharp reduction in the total of 15.5 per cent of Australian adults who own shares. Perhaps this will satisfy some atavistic bigotry in the ranks of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retired people that I represent and those from right across Australia have made it clear by their unprecedented interest in the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs that they do not see why, as prudent savers, they should be punished by an ignorant and uncaring government. This government for once should listen to the people and the more enlightened members of its own backbench and repeal this injustice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the shadow minister says, government members are changing their minds about many things. I am hopeful that perhaps the deal that they have done with the Australian Democrats in the Senate with respect to the budget may include a change to this particular legislation. I am wondering whether we are wasting our time here and the parliamentary secretary is in fact going to get up and announce a government backdown on this particular measure. He is not giving any indication of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The points that were made by my colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Ms Moylan) are absolutely correct. In recent days I have spoken to many pensioners in my electorate who have small share holdings and my advice to them, both as a member of parliament and as an accountant, is that they really have no option but to sell their shares. That was the advice the parliamentary secretary gave when he interjected on me in a previous debate. My advice, without exception, to those to whom I have spoken who are looking at their financial circumstances is that they ought to sell those shares. They clearly cannot afford to take the risk of hanging onto shares, not knowing which way they are going to move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have demonstrated the inequity of it to the parliamentary secretary time after time in my contributions to this debate. I have pointed out to him that, with almost all of the blue-chip shares prior to the operative date that the government is going to base the unrealised capital gain calculation on, which is 23 September 1992&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliamentary secretary says they should sell `some of their shares'. I am saying that because most of them have only small portfolios they will have to sell all of their shares. The parliamentary secretary has not yet given me a satisfactory explanation to another matter. I pointed out that many of the people who bought shares in Westpac or any of the major banks or the blue-chip industries did so in 1989-90 when they were at very low values and many have lost money on their shares. The mechanism that the government put in place to take account of this unrealised capital gain effectively shows in some way that they have made a gain, but they have not. I have never had a satisfactory explanation of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crunch will come for the government&mdash;I wonder whether the parliamentary secretary has done this calculation&mdash;when the savings that the government says it will make from this iniquitous and obnoxious legislation do not eventuate. Has the parliamentary secretary been advised lately of what will happen? Let me tell him what will happen: when pensioners sell their shares the projected savings will not eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the pensioners that have spoken to me and that have these small portfolios will sell their shares and use the money in some way by taking a vacation, buying a new car or whatever. And they will simply fall back more heavily into the government's social security system. Is that concept too difficult for the parliamentary secretary to wrap his mind around?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On my calculations, if most of the pensioners sell their shares, as they must, then the savings over which the government has gone to all of this trouble and caused all of this anxiety amongst pensioners with share portfolios will not eventuate. So, in the end, what was the point of the whole exercise? I have never confronted in this place such a ridiculous and absurd provision. We have been over it almost ad nauseam and we do not seem to have got the message through, that this is something that is just wrong&mdash;it is completely wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not justifying why pensioners should now be singled out as a group of people in Australia that cannot hold shares. Why would a pensioner who does not hold shares now go out into the stock market and buy shares? When the shares in Qantas, for example, are floated, why would a pensioner risk buying them? Pensioners are now the only people in Australia who will not be able to own shares in public companies. As I pointed out, they will be able to own shares in private companies but not in public companies. What is the answer to that? We have never had a satisfactory answer to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How far does one extend this obnoxious principle of taking into account unrealised gains on anything as income? This was never an argument about the assets test. I accept that if a pensioner or anyone else has shares as an asset and those shares go up in value then that should form part of the assets test. We have never had any argument about that. But time and time again I have asked the government how it can  regard unrealised capital gains as income for the purposes of the income test. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is immoral. For the umpteenth time, let me pose the question: if a pensioner has this unrealised&mdash;underlined, emphasised, in italics&mdash;gain and loses part of the pension, how does he or she pay the bills? The answer that the parliamentary secretary gave me last time is that the pensioner sells some of his or her shares. That, of course, just points out how obnoxious this particular legislation is. Even at this last minute, I hope that the government may yet change its mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that this will have a dreadful effect on the stock market does not hold water. Obviously not enough shares are involved to have any effect. But I want to make it perfectly clear on record here, as we now apparently get to the end of this debate, that all the pensioners I have spoken to&mdash;and there have been many of them&mdash;and who have outlined their circumstances to me, will sell their shares before 23 September 1993, within the next few weeks. That will not create a huge flurry of activity but that is what will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want the government to stand condemned. This may have been a complex issue for many people in Australia but this issue is one on which the government ought to stand condemned. It has picked on pensioners. It has said that pensioners should not hold shares. I pose the final question, the one I have asked time and time again: where will the government stop as far as pensioners are concerned in respect of unrealised capital gains? If the government wants to take into account increases in a pensioner's share portfolio, will it stop at the pensioner's home?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the shadow minister says, antique clocks. Where will the government stop? Cars? The principle here is so obnoxious that it potentially extends into other areas of pensioners' assets. The government has argued against that, saying that there is no market for homes or antique clocks. But there is a market for everything. Will the government force pensioners to go out and have their homes revalued each year? Is the government against the pensioners that live in my electorate who have nice homes? Does the government object to their owning those homes? Does the government want those pensioners to sell those homes and go and live off the proceeds in a caravan park?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, the whole thing is fundamentally flawed. The government is encouraging people to save, but this is a totally anti-saving piece of legislation. I have a lot of self-funded retirees in my electorate. People who have been prudent during their working lives and managed to gain some assets are being forced by government policy into using those assets in their retirement. The government does not want people who have worked hard to be able to hand on something to their children. At this last minute I implore the government to reconsider this most obnoxious piece of legislation. </PARA>

The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) has said the same thing, day in and day out, every time he has taken part in this debate. That is fine.

I have had the guts to admit that I am not a financial planner. The honourable member for McPherson is not a financial planner and, if he is an accountant, he does not know much about financial planning. So many financial planners in the community are publicly saying to pensioners who have got shares, `Don't necessarily go out and sell all your shares. Have a look at it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conveniently, the honourable member for McPherson does not say that a pensioner couple can earn $76 per week&mdash;something like $3,500 per year, which is a fair bit of income when we are talking about small shareholders&mdash;before they lose any entitlement to the pension. But the honourable member for McPherson is making it sound as if everybody should run out and sell their shares. That is not only bad advice, but it is wrong advice, and he should not be saying that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I come into this debate very late, but I have made representations to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security. The question I ask is: who got this so badly wrong? I have asked government members about their attitudes and their representations on this matter, and I have not yet found one who agrees with the proposition. While I admire the parliamentary secretary's very spirited defence of the impossible situation that has now arisen, I ask that question. I think I know the answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government today comprises too many bureaucrats who have not got enough to do, and they are thinking up new ways of getting into the public purse. Apparently, this is a novel idea. In view of compliance and implementation costs it is going to be a detrimental or negative factor. The parliamentary secretary has just mentioned those to whom this applies. Fair enough. I would suggest that most people who presently have shares are already earning $76 and are picking up a part pension. Any change or addition to that income by a notional income which is going to spring from this valuation of shares is going to reduce their income by $1 for every $2 of that notional income. That is significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give an idea of how notional that income is. I have a small parcel of shares which, at the beginning of this year, were worth half what they are listed at now. By this time next year they are likely to be back to where they started&mdash;that is the nature of the value of the shares. The wretched part is that there is no retrospectivity. In this year, if we have a notional income because of an increase in the value of those shares, we will be denied the income we would normally have got for this year. In the next year, if the shares shrink back to their previous level, we will get no increase in the pension over and above the pension which we had before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This smacks of other inequitable taxes which are quite unfair and which do not continue the system of taxation we have had in this country for so long. But one can expect it from a government that introduced the fringe benefits tax. I really mean that. In this country there has been no more iniquitous tax than the fringe benefits tax, which has affected the employment of many people. As I have said, this new tax is a penalty on employment. This manner of assessment will also have an adverse impact on savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the currency of this bill a report has been presented in this parliament from Vince FitzGerald suggesting to us that Australians are poor savers and that we are going backwards at a fast rate of knots; yet we are now to implement this tax. A previous speaker had the courtesy of saying that it probably will not impact very much on savings, but when one has a very small savings base such as we have in Australia any impact is a bad impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary said something about accountants in connection with financial planning, and I come to their defence. People have asked me, as an accountant and as a parliamentarian, what they should do. I have been giving them the hope that, come the budget, the government would see the error of its way and reverse the situation. But that has not happened. The only advice I can give these people is that they should sell those shares before they come up for valuation. That appears to me to be the only safe thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is asking them to bail out of what is a very essential part of Australia's savings strategy. The government is asking them to bail out of an income capacity, where imputation is within the dividend structure, into an investment structure of an interest rate on which tax will be payable. There again is another anomaly: people not on the pension are taxed at a much higher rate than those who are on the pension in connection with the same type of income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an iniquitous piece of legislation. I cannot believe that even the Australian Labor Party would have picked this tax up, from its own knowledge and out of its own think-tank, to penalise a section of Australians which is already being penalised. I have mentioned that young people are being denied employment because of the fringe benefits tax. I suggest that older people, who are the most sensitive and who require a lot of assistance, are being penalised at the other end of the scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been a member of this House for a very long time, and we have often talked in here about social justice. Social justice, particularly the type of social justice the Labor Party espouses, is not the province solely of the Labor Party. In this budget the government is requiring people in need&mdash;a very susceptible part of our citizenry&mdash;to pay their optical expenses. We are denying that as a basic right of Medicare. That is as offensive as the fringe benefits tax and this tax we are debating here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must also consider the unintended consequences&mdash;or should I say the intended consequences&mdash;of this legislation. An already very small area of savings, which is very important to Australia, will diminish. People will be forced to plan their affairs so that they will arrive at a pensionable age&mdash;not self-sufficient as we have been trying to get them to be&mdash;dependent on the pension. It is a catch-22 situation where there will be no assistance whatsoever. These people are vulnerable. I have heard here some very good speeches.

In doing so, I confront the parliamentary secretary with a very obvious message: these proposals are not loved by the Australian pensioner community; they are not supported by financial advisers; they are not supported by virtually any editorial writer in the country; they are not supported by any of the pensioners organisations; they are even not supported by his own colleagues. The government benches are even emptier this evening than they were on the night of the opposition's response to the budget. The parliamentary secretary cannot find anybody willing to back him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the presence of the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) who, as a man interested in the welfare of veterans, will also be concerned about the contents of this particular proposal because these measures affect veterans as well as social security pensioners. Anyone with any concern for the people who have served their country would also be concerned about the proposal that the government is putting forward to include the unrealised capital gain on shares in the income test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the parliamentary secretary needs to be convinced that there is a great deal of opposition to what he is proposing, I refer him to events in the House last Thursday morning when a large number of petitions were presented to this parliament, all of which opposed the measures that his government is planning to introduce. I presented one of the petitions&mdash;I think there were eight others&mdash;which all clearly demonstrated the depth of public feeling on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petitioners submitted that the government's proposal to treat unrealised capital gains and losses on listed securities as income under the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlement Act should be abandoned. The petitioners noted that the majority of Australians regard the proposed method of calculating unrealised capital gains and losses as unfair and inequitable. It is clearly beyond dispute that the method of calculating unrealised capital gain is unjust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previous speakers have pointed out, in many instances shares will be assessed as having earned a capital gain even when, in reality, they are worth less than the purchase price. Even though pensioners have lost money on their investment, their pension will be stopped on the basis of an unrealised capital gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any system with that kind of result must be regarded as unfair&mdash;but it is worse than that. The government devised a very complicated formula which accentuates the impact of any capital gain. It is not even a fair game. It has devised a scheme that multiplies the disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unrealised capital gain is assessed as part of the income test&mdash;but so are the real earnings on the shares. It is perfectly fair for the real gain&mdash;the actual earnings&mdash;to be included in the income test, just as it is perfectly fair to include the capital gain in the assets test. What is unfair and unconscionable about this whole exercise is that the unrealised capital gain is counted twice. The government is double counting so that it can limit people's pension entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that the petitioners raised was that the implementation of this measure would have a deleterious effect on national savings and investments of pensioners and veterans. Again, surely that point is beyond dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) pointed out, building up a national savings strategy is essential to the future economic wellbeing of this nation. Our country is ageing. I was interested in some statistics I saw the other day which pointed out that the number of people in Australia over the age of 80 has increased by 114 per cent in the last two decades. An increasing number of Australians will become social security beneficiaries and be dependent on the age pension. That number will increase as the years go by. The commitment and the obligation of the government to meet those social security payments will grow year in year out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is universal agreement across the nation that we need to be undertaking measures which will encourage personal savings and which will encourage people to put aside for their own retirement so that they do not have to depend upon government and taxpayers to meet their retirement incomes. That principle is well established and well agreed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure does precisely the opposite. It penalises those who have taken care of their own retirement and those who have tried to get the maximum possible return from their investments so that they rely less on their fellow Australians in their retirement. This measure, therefore, is totally in conflict with, and totally contradictory to, the rhetoric of the government; totally contrary to the recommendations made by every economic adviser in the country; and totally in conflict with what is good sense for the financial management of our country in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point that the petitioners make is that they regard the government's estimates of cost savings as spurious. Again, that is a statement which is completely beyond dispute. The government keeps changing the estimates. Clearly, it does not have a clue how much it is going to allegedly save by implementing this measure. Many people believe that in the long term, even in the medium term, the savings there might be in 1993-94 will be offset by losses in future years. Whenever the share values decline, the government's liability for pension payments will increase. Any gains that are made in a particular year will be lost, firstly, as a result of pensioners selling off their shares and becoming permanently dependent upon the social security system; and, secondly, further down the track, any pensioners who retain any shareholdings will, when the value of those shareholdings drops, develop an entitlement to a pension where none existed before. That will have an impact on future budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that a government that is interested in risk management would want to reduce its liability for pensions at times when its own income is low. Of course, when share values drop, the government's income will drop as well. That will be just at a time when it will have to pay more pensioners. The logic of whatever the government is attempting to achieve in this regard has escaped all of the petitioners who put their names to the many petitions presented to the parliament on the last sitting Thursday. It certainly escaped the notice of the contributors to this debate, pensioner organisations, veterans organisations and all of those who are likely to be affected by this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) has taken over from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who has taken a little relief from the battering he continues to get on this particular issue. I feel some degree of sorrow for him. I am told that Queensland has battled to get much of a say on the government benches. He was touted as one of those who may have some kind of ministerial ambitions, but the government has certainly sold him a rotten egg on this one. He is being asked to carry something that none of the government ministers are prepared to carry themselves. They are palming it on to a poor, lonely Queenslander. His electorate is surrounded by many pensioners who will be affected by this measure. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, in his rebuttal to the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), went to great lengths to point out that houses are not likely to be affected by this measure. That just accentuates one of the inequities of the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that houses, whether they are worth $100,000 or $5 million, are not taken into account in assessing pension eligibility. The capital gain on a house could be hundreds of thousands of dollars in a year and that does not affect the pension. The capital gain on clocks or an art collection can be considerable and it will not affect the pension. But if a pensioner happens to have some shareholdings, then his pension will be affected. Of course, only shareholdings in listed companies are affected. If his shareholdings are in unlisted companies, it does not matter. This whole measure is grossly inconsistent. It targets one small group of pensioners and treats them unfairly. That is unfortunate for them, but the message that this particular proposal gives to the whole retired population is that this government does not want people to make their own arrangements for their retirement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security pointed out, a number of us have spoken on this particular issue on a number of occasions. This is the third occasion on which I have had the opportunity to speak. It is a chance that I cannot let go by because the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill very badly affects senior citizens in Australia; a section of our community who should be revered and respected rather than hounded from pillar to post, as is the case with this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without doubt, it is the most unfair, pernicious and mean spirited legislation to affect pensioners and many other social security recipients for a long time. This piece of legislation deals with the government's treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares as income for the purposes of calculating one's pension or another social security payment. Only two weeks ago, I spoke on this issue, pleading with the government to reconsider its stance. I know for a fact that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) opposes the legislation. He said so in a letter to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin). The honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) also spoke two weeks ago&mdash;I was in this chamber whilst she spoke&mdash;suggesting the legislation was unfair. In fact, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the recent parliamentary recess I, like every member of this house, was visited by many pensioners who were very worried about the impact upon their pensions of recent changes to the assessment of shares and their value. I confess to some serious disquiet over this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She did not. I suggest to most government members that if they had an ounce of compassion in their blood they would also be suffering more than just `serious disquiet' over the issue. This legislation, for a start, defies logic. It assumes pensioners who own shares which rise in price have earned more when in fact they have not earned one extra cent. Under this legislation, it is assumed that pensioners have earned more and their pensions are subsequently cut.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another comment by the honourable member for Lowe, which I endorse, is her claim that the office of every member has been contacted by concerned pensioners who are, quite frankly, worried sick about this issue. I am sure that every member of this House has had elderly Australians in tears in their offices over this ridiculous legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One such gentleman to whom I spoke last week is a constituent of mine named Reg. He asked me how he would survive, considering that his next eight pension cheques would all have to go towards paying his electricity bill. His pension was cut to $30. He earns $30 per week, down from $156.05 per week. While this legislation may assume he earns more, his gain is only notional, as we all know. We have all argued this point over and over again. He does not have one extra cent in his pocket. Indeed, as I say, he is now considerably out of pocket because of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said when I spoke on this matter recently, pensioners are being penalised for notional gains, but notional gains do not buy groceries or petrol or pay for insurance. Notional gains are absolutely worthless. They are certainly not paying this man's electricity bills. It is only when pensioners sell their shares that they get money and that is the only time they should be assessed. The present situation is an absolute sham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention another gentleman who has contacted my office. His name is Keith. He bought two packages of the same shares about six weeks ago. This shows how ridiculous and unthought-out this whole legislation is. He bought one lot of shares at 25c and the other at 24c. The shares are now valued at 23c. Over the last six weeks, Keith has actually made a loss on these shares. How does the Department of Social Security view this? It assumes he bought the shares 12 months ago&mdash;which is when it takes them into account for accounting purposes&mdash;for 5c because that is what the shares were worth at the time, and that he has made a profit of 18c and 19c per share, which he obviously has not. The fact is that he made a loss, his pension is now going to be cut, he will be out of pocket and he has no other form of income. This is totally ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote directly from a letter written by a constituent to me, the Minister for Social Security, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">RE: PENSIONS AND UNREALISED CAPITAL GAINS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is with great anger and bitterness that I write to you with respect to the above. Because of the "Catch 22" situation you have created, I have been forced to sell my small share holdings, no doubt to overseas owners, and in so doing you have attacked my human right to improve my position in life by my own means, thereby not only undermining my earning capacity but also robbing me of hope for the future and destroying my self esteem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a group of highly paid elitists to formulate a policy that seeks to pauperise what is already the poorest section of the community, reduces the nation to the likes of an oppressive dictatorship, not a modern caring democratic society. Your cavalier remark "let them sell some shares if they need extra income" shows how little any of you understand the nature of capital and investment. Your remarks smack of Marie Antoinette and her utterance "let them eat cake" and we all know what happened to her!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You beseech people daily to save for the good of the nation, yet what earthly incentive would any one have to invest in Australia when your ultimate plan is to claw back the growth in the investment. The whole purpose of the exercise is to create a dividend stream, which I accept is reasonable to adjust for pension purposes, and capital growth in order to defend the value against inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not have superannuation and in any case it would be hard for anyone to plan around that concept as your government has, so far, over the last decade managed to alter those rules on an average once every eight weeks. Who could plan on that basis?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just for the record, having sold my shares, I have used the proceeds purchasing goods, mostly imported, that I was previously happy to do without as I purchased greater independence by investing in shares. Therefore in one move I have helped to swell the B.O.P. problem, destroyed what little capital I had, and will now be eligible for a full pension. In one fell swoop you have managed to increase the welfare burden and chip away at the capital base of the nation. Well done!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, I was one of those, who when faced with a difficult choice at the polls, opted for your government because I believed you were a compassionate force in the land and compassion must be the basis for a civilised society. However, I see now I was mistaken and your vicious attack on a defenceless minority combined with your budget strategy forces me to the conclusion that I got it wrong. One does not make the same mistake twice.</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, I implore our Democrat colleagues in the Senate, if they have an ounce of integrity about them, to look very closely at this matter. As they are in the business at the moment of doing some deals with the government, let us see them do a deal that will help a small section of Australians who are being severely disadvantaged by this measure. I implore our Democrat colleagues in the Senate to keep the born-out-of-wedlocks honest. </PARA>

What I am saying is that, nevertheless, those opposite are still trying to scare pensioners as much as they possibly can by somehow implying that just about everyone is going to be affected&mdash;or at least a vast majority of pensioners are going to be affected. The reality is that out of some 2.1 million pensioners, and approximately 400,000 people in receipt of DVA entitlements, only 100,000 will be affected. That must be taken into consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the difference&mdash;I have made this point very clearly&mdash;between having $150,000 in the bank earning the present deemed interest rate of four per cent, or whatever it is now, and having $90,000 in the bank and $110,000 worth of shares? One person&mdash;because the money is in the form of shares and that person is able to disguise the earning capacity of those shares&mdash;can receive a full pension, whereas the person who has the lesser amount in the bank can receive only a part pension. Honourable members might nod as much as they like; they know full well that that is the truth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a few comments in relation to this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. I congratulate the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) on moving the amendments. I think that in years to come the honourable member will be seen as a national hero on the part of pensioners. Those members and senators who supported these changes will also be seen by many pensioners around the country as heroic in their actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position is quite clear, as the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) commented in his third address&mdash;and it is no accident that he was in here three times talking about this legislation. He properly represents the social security recipients, the pensioners, in his electorate by coming in here and making sure that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security hears the arguments enough times to try to persuade him to change his mind, to get the government to support those amendments, or to repeal the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of matters I wanted to raise. In the first instance, I mention the meeting that was held in Perth at the YWCA in Wellington Street on 30 July. It was a very big meeting and it was organised by me, the honourable member for Stirling and the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans). I have already commented on the superb representation made by the honourable member for Stirling. I add also that those pensioners who reside in the electorate of Stirling now get the sort of representation that they sadly missed for 10 years&mdash;or, in the case of the electorate of Cowan, since 1984 when the seat was created in the redistribution of Western Australian electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that there is a great deal of cause for hope in those electorates now that the people are getting representation by their federal members who understand the feelings of the large numbers of pension recipients. Those people who are self-funded retirees, because of the decline in their incomes thanks to the drop in the interest rate, now face the prospect of applying for pensions. They may have share investments and may find themselves caught by the changes that were brought in as a result of the legislation introduced by the government last year. We see some instances where they are still suffering a net capital loss on the value of their shares since they purchased them. Notwithstanding that fact, because of the arrangements between September last year and September this year, any capital gain that may have accrued in the last 12 months will mean a commensurate decline in their pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to let the parliament know the views of the people who attended the meeting at the YWCA on 30 July, who are affected by this legislation, and who met as a result of the initiative on my part and on the part of the honourable member for Cowan and the honourable member for Stirling. Because there was not to be a public hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs in Perth, we decided that we would have our own hearing. At the conclusion of that meeting, certain motions were unanimously passed by those present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security says, `Of course'. He is trying to suggest that somehow we put together a clique of people at this meeting to come in and support the position that we had taken. We invited everybody who was interested in this particular issue to come along. It is no coincidence that the people who came along were obviously affected by this legislation. Something that interested and impressed me was the fact that the room was filled a quarter of an hour before the meeting started. There was standing room only; we had to get some more chairs because so many people were coming in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was absolutely no question of how they felt about the intent of the government. They did not see this as some means of reducing the burden on the taxpayer that pensions present. They saw it as another means of the government putting its fingers in the pockets of those people who have taken the trouble to save for their own retirement. Some pensioners now wonder why they bothered. Every time people seem to save a little money for their retirement, one can bet one's money that the government has its fingers in their pockets and takes it away from them. If it does not take the money away from them, it withdraws the other benefits to which they believed they were entitled as they were making those meagre savings during their years prior to retirement. I have no qualms about supporting the comments made by the honourable member for Stirling, who said that this was mean spirited, iniquitous legislation. I add that it is in fact immoral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) talked about assessing the unrealised capital gain of a person's residence and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security pooh-poohed the idea as being some sort of pie in the sky measure that would never happen, I bet that 10 years ago many people would never have believed in their wildest dreams that the federal government would assess the unrealised capital gains on shares that they held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know, as many pensioners told us, that in one 12-month period they may enjoy a gain on their shares, and they will then get the reduction in their pension income. But, in the next 12 months if they suffer a net loss on their shares, do they get a make up of the income they lost in the previous 12 months? Of course they do not. They lose both ways. Hence, it adds to the immorality of this dreadful legislation that affects so many decent and upstanding members of the pensioner community&mdash;people who believed all through their working lives that to save, to put away money for their retirement was something to be commended and admired. Now they find themselves at a loss as a result of taking the trouble to save for their own retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Stirling and others have mentioned, why do people bother to save under these circumstances? Is it a surprise that this country has a savings crisis? Of course it is not. The very sections of the community one would expect to save for their retirement, in other words to contribute to national savings, are being hounded from pillar to post. The federal government has its fingers in their pockets at every stage. I point out that at the meeting in Perth the people resolved unanimously:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this meeting condemns legislation affecting pensions by the assessment of notional capital gains on shares and managed investments as income as both unfair and abhorrent, and urges that the legislation be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the principle of assessment of unrealised capital gains is immoral, and a disincentive to those who attempt to provide for their own future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the criteria for costings for implementation of this legislation is wrong, and will become a net cost to taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this legislation is a powerful disincentive to growth in the Australian share market, and will affect future recovery of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that the sentiments of these people from Perth  who were affected by the federal government's legislation is driven resoundingly home. Peter Thornhill of the Perpetual Trustees group commented that the proposed policy presented a basic misunderstanding of investment in the share market. In other words, the federal government does not even have its intent right. The intent does not match the nature or the trends in share market investment by pensioners. As Peter Thornhill mentioned in the article written by Barrie Dunstan&mdash;I commend Barrie Dunstan and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> for his campaign against this iniquitous legislation&mdash;this is off the mark. It makes a misrepresentation of the share market as being a capital gains issue on the part of pensioners. It is not. It is an income issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensioners should look to their investment portfolios and the potential effects of this legislation on those portfolios and seek expert advice. I make no bones about this&mdash;I am sure all honourable members on this side of the chamber would agree&mdash;it is important for any pensioner who has shares and is likely to be affected by this legislation to get expert financial assistance and financial advice to be able to make the correct decision at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary lowers himself by criticising the opposition on the basis that somehow we are indulging in scaremongering. That is wrong. People are worried about the legislation and need to know exactly what it means to them. They need to get expert financial assistance. Because of the pledge, the parliamentary secretary must support this legislation. I was interested to hear the comments that related to the honourable member for Lowe (Ms Easson) who has had disquiet about this legislation. If she is disquieted by the legislation, then let her cross the floor and vote for the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), which is the decent thing to do. She should not stand on the other side of the chamber and express her disquiet about the legislation and then sit down and vote with the rest of the Labor Party. This will ensure that the iniquitous provisions of the legislation are rammed home to pensioners who have shares. </PARA>

I would like to bring to the attention of the few government members in the chamber some statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on social security. It is a much hackneyed phrase on social justice that we have been hearing the government rabbit on about since the parliament resumed after the election.

We have the calculation, which is as simple as we can make it, but it is still difficult for a lot of these people to understand. Their concern is not so much what they are going to lose, but how to understand it. They just want to know what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also ask, `If I make a loss on one parcel of shares, will I be able to offset this against gains on my other shares?'. The answer is, `Yes. Social Security works out how much income all your shares and managed investments have returned. This amount can be positive or negative depending on how well each investment has done. Negative amounts&mdash;that is, losses&mdash;can be deducted from the total amount of income from your shares and managed investments. The following example explains how it works'. That is a complicated explanation of how that does work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not necessarily stirring up the argument in my electorate, I am trying to help my constituents understand what they will be faced with in September when they have to make a balanced decision on what they will do with their share portfolio. This is directly opposite to what we should believe and what we should be supporting in this country: getting people to invest rather than spend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last 10 to 15 years we have been on a spending binge and have not been saving. Year after year this government is providing the incentives to spend and not to save. This is just another of those incentives&mdash;to spend, to get rid of your assets and to bring people down to the lowest common denominator so that the government has control of their pocket, their thinking and, ultimately, the control of their vote. That is what it is all about. When the government talks about social justice issues it does not care that this is a nightmare for this section of the community. It is only a very small percentage of the community, but they are real people. Many people who voted for the government in March this year have told me that they are never going to vote for it again because of these issues and what it has done in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are real people whom the government said it cared for. We do not believe it cares for them. I will never believe it when members of the government start rabbiting on with a lot of nonsense about `We have the social justice agenda by the throat'. They have&mdash;they are choking it. They are boring it in to the poor people in this community who need the support and understanding of the government in these hard economic times. They are trying to alleviate the burden on taxpayers. All the government wants to do is get them by the throat and squeeze the last little drop of blood out of them. We have to roll this over for the sake of that small percentage of the community that does not deserve to be treated this way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only a short contribution to make to this debate. Most of the things that need to be said have been said. However, I must reiterate that to reduce pensions because of unrealised capital gain on shares is iniquitous. How the government could have arrived at that decision I do not know. As other speakers have said, it is easy to understand that government members have become the playthings of their bureaucrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that such people as the honourable member for Lowe (Ms Easson) and the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) expressed their disquiet. I wonder whether they will see this legislation as a rare act of bastardry as well. I would like to take the Parliamentary Secretary  to the Minister for Social Security up on a few points. He said that of the 2.1 million Australians who receive pensions and the 400,000 who receive veterans pensions only 100,000 are affected. As if we can dismiss 100,000 Australians and it just does not matter! Some 100,000 Australians, who worked their little tails off to build up their share portfolios, who were self-sufficient, who wanted to provide for part of their retirement, who did the decent and honourable thing that most Australians have always wanted to do&mdash;to be self-sufficient in their retirement&mdash;will have their shares eroded as if by a cancer. Every time bills get beyond them because their pensions have been cut back&mdash;electricity bills, car registration and all the things we have heard of this afternoon&mdash;they will sell off a few more shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For people in their 60s, 70s and 80s to have to do that is very demoralising. What the parliamentary secretary is saying is, `We can demoralise 100,000 Australians. We can afford to let them be the playthings of bureaucrats, let their lifestyle drop, use them as a tool to raise a bit of money for the government and erode their pensions and at the end of the day they will have to cop it or become ordinary pensioners'. As the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) said, those people will become totally dependent on the government and the plaything of its political agenda. If what the honourable member for Lyne said was not enough, there is ample evidence of it in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the government have expressed disquiet that retirees who have holiday pay and long service leave outstanding will be taxed at a higher rate. Taxing those people and putting them out to retirement on a lower income than they might otherwise have had will make them dependent on the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing the parliamentary secretary said was that we are trying to help these people disguise their earning capacity. I do not think anyone is trying to do that. Shares are listed every day on the stock exchange and the listings are in the newspaper. The interesting thing is that, although one would think that the government, with its sense of fair play, would allow any loss in pension to be an adjusting factor, it has not. Whichever way we look at this, people lose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time deeming was introduced the government said that this would materially improve the lot of pensioners. One of the excuses used to bring in deeming was that, by earning a little on savings, pensioners would be better off and less dependent on government. If that were the case, why does the government not apply the same principle to shares? There is a total inconsistency and I cannot believe that not only the honourable members for Lowe and Fraser, but any members of the government&mdash;including the parliamentary secretary who comes from one of the middle class suburbs of Brisbane where there are a lot of retired people&mdash;could believe in their wildest dreams that that was a sincere statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the parliamentary secretary took up the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) on the point that last year members of the opposition voted for this measure. But they did so because it was tied to another bill. The government did not allow the opposition to separate this matter from increases to pensions. It knew full well that to delay this matter my colleagues at that time would have had to deny pensioners a just entitlement&mdash;an increase in their pensions. It was a very cynical move of the previous government to tie those two measures together. This afternoon the parliamentary secretary is doing the Pontius Pilate act, trying to wipe his hands of it and put it back on to the honourable member for Moore. It was the government's initiative last year as it is its initiative this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Hinkler the case is no different from that in Pearce, Stirling, Moore, Wide Bay and Riverina, where there have been meetings of unbelievable numbers of pensioners&mdash;200, 300 or 400 people at a time&mdash;all expressing their views. Also attending those meetings have been accountants and financial planners, and not one will agree with the government's measures. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) has said on countless occasions that it is fair enough to use the unrealised capital gain in assessing eligibility for pensions but that to use it as a revenue measure is purely immoral, unjust and unconscionable. </PARA>

If the honourable member for Hinkler( Mr Neville) had been here at that time, he would have done exactly what his colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) did; he would have voted for the measure. When we are talking about fairness, it should be put on the record that, before a pensioner couple, for instance, lose entitlement to all pension and Commonwealth fringe benefits, they can be receiving an income of up to $31,293 per annum. On top of this, they can have assets, apart from their family home, of up to $292,000&mdash;which the government is extending to $338,500 in September this year. A young married couple struggling with a mortgage, car payments, education expenses for children, et cetera, would find that quite an attractive proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

But, if those opposite are going to point that out, they should also point out that we are not talking about taking every cent of pension from people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to participate, if only very briefly, in this committee debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, who is at the table, has been talking about fairness. I agree with him on one point: it is totally unfair that he was put in here to take all of this. Where is the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin)? Why is he not here to face up to it? This is cowardice of the highest order. It is about time the minister came in and faced the music himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Australian Labor Party have been going out and scaring old people in this country for 10 years. We have talked about the assets test campaign and what government members did in the 1984 election. There has been a succession of measures when they have upset the equanimity and the peace of the retired people of Australia. Whether they be pensioners or self-funded retirees, this is just another sorry chapter in that whole process of scaring the old people. It is about time it stopped. Old people in their declining years need to be able to live in some peace and harmony and, above all, not to be continually frightened about what will happen to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure is totally unjust, unfair and inequitable. Government members talk about equity. It is just a loose and idle word as far as they are concerned. They do not know what it means. There can be no equity in saying to a pensioner, `We are going to reduce your pension because the value of a few shares you own has gone up'. Pensioners do not actually have the money in their pockets; they have to sell their shares to get it. Nonetheless, their pensions are put down because of it. The whole philosophy of this legislation is unjust and unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I say to the parliamentary secretary at the table that there are no marks in comparing poverty. He said that 100,000 people is only five per cent of 2.6 million people. Whether it is 100,000 people or five per cent of 2.6 million people, that is just playing with figures. All it takes is one elderly Australian who is worried sick by this and who is actually going to be hurt, lose money and be placed further down the poverty ladder. Forget about the five per cent. One person is enough. The fact that it is 100,000 people makes it that much worse. I do not think that it is appropriate to talk about poverty and say that young families with mortgages would think that it was okay. I do not think that is the way to go. I implore the government to change its mind about this measure. It is unfair and unjust. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity this afternoon to speak in support of the amendments that I have moved to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. I want to recapitulate what they are. The amendments seek to repeal the relevant sections in the Social Security Act that are designed to treat shares owned by pensioners and any profit that it is suggested might be taken by any increase in value in those shares, even though they are not sold, as income for the purposes of the income test for pension eligibility. The amendments relate to shares in which any dividend is already assessed as income for the purpose of the income test and any increase in the value of the shares is already treated as an increase in the value of assets held by the pensioner should that occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike most other assets owned by pensioners where any increase in value is treated as an increase in their asset value, if they are shares that increase in value they will be treated as income, even though a person may not have sold them. So people could end up with a very substantial reduction in their income for survival purposes and left with only one option, of having to dispose of the assets, if they are going to be able to eat. That is the bottom line. It is important not to forget that that is the issue which we have been debating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government said today that this was a measure upon which we voted to support the government when it was introduced into law. At no time did the opposition support the government on this measure. The measure was introduced as one proposal with a large number of other proposals beneficial for pensioners. The government said, `You can have it only as a total package. If you want to amend it to reduce or eliminate that particular part of the package, then none of it will proceed, and we will blame you, the opposition, for that'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We pledged that when this matter came forward we would review it when in office, in the expectation that we were going to win the election and be able to repeal these provisions. We promised a review. That is what happened. For the government to suggest that we are in some way tainted because of that is totally misrepresenting our position in a way which I think does the minister no credit at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are only a few days left for the government to relent on this matter. I want to give the minister this assurance: I will not accuse the government of capitulation. I will not accuse the government of surrendering, of giving way, of giving ground or backing down. I will not try to make that point. I would be happy just to see the pensioner community relieved of the anxieties that they are genuinely suffering. At the moment, as the government is looking at backing down, capitulating, surrendering and giving way on the budget, it is getting a lot of flack. It could just add this matter in quietly. Right now, while the budget is under review, under retreat, there is a great challenge for the government to look at this matter again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be a real test for the Australian Democrats. I read that the Democrats are at the moment in negotiation with the government. They do not want to be seen as budget wreckers or as undermining the budget strategy. Let me assure the Democrats that if they believe, as we do, in all the arguments that we have put that there is no money involved in this, no substantial savings, they can join us in pressing the government at this time to make the change. This ought to be one of the major initiatives on which they press the government as part of their agreeing to a deal which they are talking about with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at this time. It will be a genuine test for the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that last week Senator Lees was at a substantially attended meeting in Chatswood in Sydney. She was asked by some of the people there whether the Democrats on this matter would seek to change the government's mind. She was a little equivocal. Maybe the reason she was equivocal was that they have not done the deal yet. Senator Lees and all of her colleagues have gone around tut tutting and saying, `We were purer than the opposition on this matter'. I want to assure the Democrats that this is the time of test. It has to be one of the matters about which they treat with the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security has been saying that no new information has been put in relation to this matter today. He seems to be a bit disappointed. I will put some new information before him. I want to remind him of what the actuaries have had to say in their submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs about savings that can be made in relation to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been putting it around that it can save something in the order of $60 million to $80 million through this legislation. I want to make it very clear that when the experts&mdash;the actuaries&mdash;got onto it, they were able to say that the government was making certain assumptions that were totally unrealistic. In the view of the actuaries, if certain alternative assumptions were put&mdash;assuming a growth rate of 18 per cent&mdash;the savings could be $40 million. But if one made an assumption, which was also a proper assumption, of a growth rate of nine per cent, the savings would fall to $21 million. The government ought to be taking that into account&mdash;the amounts that can be saved are getting smaller and smaller. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At question time today I was interested that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) had the audacity to say to us all that certain assumptions need to be made in looking at budget matters. He protested that people were not making assumptions. One of the failures on the government's part in relation to this matter, which it has put to us over and over again, is that no assumptions should be made about changed behaviour when estimating possible savings. The government has put this argument over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it very clear that it is a flawed view to judge that there will be no alterations in behaviour. I will say something about that because it is important in the context of some of the minister's comments today on this question of whether or not people have been advised to sell their shares. One commentator, Mr Dunstan, said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that pensioners should not rush to sell. The minister is suggesting that this is an argument that people ought to be secure in holding onto their shares and that they may not be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon reading the article, it is very clear that Mr Dunstan is saying that, so far as the Senate inquiry is concerned, it might result in some favourable amendments and early selling may not therefore be necessary. That is what it was arguing: `Wait until you see the whites of their eyes before you make the judgment'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This weekend a senior officer of a public company came to me to ask for some advice on whether I thought the government was going to change its mind. I had to say, `I don't know whether the government is going to change its mind or not. I can't tell you that. Your guess is as good as mine'. But she said, `People are ringing us. They're worried about this matter. We are getting hundreds and thousands of calls about this matter&mdash;should we sell or not?'. This is a very serious matter. It is not something that has been beaten up by the opposition. People know that it is necessary for them to consider their position because of the impact that these proposals will have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to take Senator Faulkner to task. He has been writing to people saying that it is surely unfair if people have hundreds of thousands of dollars invested&mdash;and these are the people who will be mostly affected&mdash;to call on taxpayers to provide them with a full pension. What audacity, suggesting that that is the case when, on the government's own submission to the Senate inquiry, those with shares valued at over $100,000 number only 1,497; and when, on the government's own estimates, only $5 million is affected. </PARA>

The opposition only promised to review the legislation and, at the end of the day, it would have left it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can certainly understand that this measure&mdash;as indeed any measure which impinges upon the rights and entitlements of people generally, but particularly our senior citizens&mdash;would cause some concern. I regret that and I apologise on behalf of opposition members&mdash;because, like me, they are members of this parliament&mdash;that there has been an unwarranted attack on pensioners in the form of scaremongering so that a lot of people who will not be affected by this measure may well think they will be. I apologise to those people for that. I have many retired people in my middle-class electorate, as does the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), and they know that this measure that I have been supporting on behalf of the government is one which, when looked at fairly on the basis of equity, is nowhere near as bad as the honourable member for Berowra and other opposition members have said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take this opportunity to rectify a gross exaggeration of the truth that has been perpetrated by some sections of the media and the opposition which has caused unnecessary alarm within Australia's aged community. Many media outlets, for the sake of grabbing and manufacturing headlines, have assisted in scaring the public by saying that the government&mdash;in particular me&mdash;has said that every dollar of a senior citizen's nest egg must be consumed before that person is entitled to the pension. This is absolutely not the case at all and I have never said that. During numerous media interviews, I have indicated that, outside the generous income and assets test limits currently offered by the government, senior citizens are expected to use savings beyond these thresholds to support themselves before they approach social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the extremely generous pensioner income and assets tests allowed by this government, it is possible for a full pensioner couple to have almost $100,000 in the bank at the current deemed rate; $160,500 in assets outside the family home; plus the family home, which could be worth anything from $100,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending upon where the pensioner couple live. In short, quite the contrary to not having any nest egg to pass on to children or grandchildren, it is possible for a pensioner couple to pass on a nest egg of just under half a million dollars or thereabouts while they have still been able to obtain the full combined pension. Looking at a single pensioner with his or her own home, the same thing applies only he or she cannot have as much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part-pensioner couples are in an even better position and could accumulate nest eggs of well beyond half a million dollars to pass on to offspring before they lose full entitlement to the pension. I have already said that a pensioner couple can earn what amounts to average weekly earnings before they lose full entitlement to the pension and thus entitlement to fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those members of the media and the opposition who persist in selective quoting, knowing full well the truth of this matter, should apologise to the thousands of elderly Australians who have become unnecessarily worried sick in the false belief that they can no longer leave their children or grandchildren a nest egg. That right will always be there under a Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill is a source of great concern to the coalition. Our concern stems from two key areas. The bill is yet another example of the very sloppy legislative and administrative practices which we have come to expect from this government. Time and again, this parliament is forced to consider amendments to pieces of legislation which have been poorly drafted, not sufficiently thought through, poorly administered or else rushed through the House without giving the parliament sufficient time for proper scrutiny and analysis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my own experience, I know that many of the customs bills for which I have had responsibility over the last three years have to some extent been to correct drafting and administrative errors. The House may recall the Customs and Excise Amendment Bill 1990. This bill closed a loophole in the Customs Act which otherwise would have forced the Australian Customs Service to return to their owners all the dangerous items which they had previously confiscated. If not corrected, this loophole would have seen thousands of guns, flick-knives, landmines, machine-guns and the like flood back into the community. I do not need to tell the House what the horrendous consequences of this would have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall another customs bill which remedied an error which incorrectly allowed some spirits and spirit based soft drinks to be exempt from excise. The opposition consistently has drawn to the attention of the government the consequences of its poor legislative and administrative practices; yet there has been no change. We continue to be confronted with bills similar to the one currently before the House. I have to wonder whether the government will learn. I hope it will learn soon because we are fast running out of patience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the bill currently before the House arises out of an error in previous amendments which were overseen by the former Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs, now the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall). There is no doubt that the minister made a right royal mess of implementing this policy, although perhaps we should count ourselves lucky: he has gone on to much bigger and better things, overseeing what is now commonly known as the pay TV debacle. In light of his mishandling of the pay TV issue, the botch-up he has made of this particular piece of legislation and the administration of the department, one should question his ability to hold the high office that he does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second source of concern to the coalition arises from the retrospective nature of this bill. The coalition is always loath to support retrospective legislation, especially when it takes away a given benefit or imposes additional obligations on private persons. Indeed, we have consistently and firmly adopted the position that we will not support retrospective tax legislation because it can potentially impose extra costs on the community. It is the coalition's view that taxpayers must be confident of their obligations when they undertake their planning, budgetary, investment and other financial decisions. Likewise, they must be certain that the government cannot levy extra taxes and charges which are retrospective and hence face a backdated fiscal responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not, and will not, back away from this principle. In fact, I reiterate for the benefit of the government that we remain opposed to retrospective tax legislation. However, in some other cases&mdash;and I stress that these will be very few in number&mdash;there may be compelling reasons for the coalition to consider its position on retrospective legislation. These circumstances must be of an extreme nature and such that they will have a significant and detrimental impact on the community. The example I mentioned earlier is a good case in point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The customs amendment seeking to close the loophole and hence prevent the return of dangerous goods to their owners was retrospective to 1956. The coalition supported the amendment because of the mitigating circumstances, including the potentially devastating impact on the community. In commenting on this particular piece of legislation, my colleague the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to underline the point that in principle we are totally opposed to retrospective legislation and this is a very special case where the principle, if you like, is somewhat outweighed by the commonsense principle of allowing all this dangerous equipment back into the community.</PARA>
<PARA>In the same way, the coalition has to consider the retrospective element of the bill currently before the House in the context of a whole range of circumstances, including the potential impact on the industry and customers, the background to the original legislation, what it sought to achieve, the nature of the amendments and what they seek to do. In doing this, we have adopted a commonsense approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, after considerable deliberation, the coalition will not be opposing this bill. However, I put the government on notice that our support on this occasion is strictly once-off. In no way does it set a precedent for future support of retrospective legislation, especially tax legislation. Indeed, the coalition will consider any further retrospective legislation in the context of the circumstances which led to it being made necessary. Only in the most extreme and mitigating circumstances will we see our way clear to ever support such legislation. Let me say again to the government that, if it gets its legislative act together, it is highly unlikely that the coalition will again be placed in this position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of the House, let me give a little background to the bill. The bill amends the Customs Tariff Act 1987 to put beyond doubt the intent of item 41A to apply to only the participants of the passenger motor vehicle plan. As most honourable members in the House will know, the government since 1985 has had in place a range of measures designed to encourage the rationalisation and international competitiveness of the Australian passenger motor vehicle and component industry. The passenger motor vehicle plan, as these measures are collectively known, was modified in 1988, with quotas and the local content rule being dropped and a new, more flexible export facilitation scheme introduced. The plan was then reviewed in 1990 by the Industry Commission, and a new set of initiatives was announced in the March 1991 industry statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present passenger motor vehicle plan is intended by the government to take the industry through to the year 2000, and includes a reduction in tariffs applying to passenger motor vehicles of 2 1/2 per cent per year, phasing down to 15 per cent at the end of the decade; a reduction in tariffs on four-wheel drive and light commercial vehicles in line with general manufacturing tariffs; the continuation of the 15 per cent entitlement to duty free import of passenger motor vehicle products; and the continuation of the export facilitation scheme, including its extension to component manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export facilitation scheme is targeted at the four car plan producers as well as domestic component manufacturers. The House will recall that there were originally five car plan producers but that this fell following the closure of the Nissan manufacturing plant. The scheme encourages the domestic production and export of motor vehicles and components by allowing producers to earn credits in respect of items exported. Credits are earned on the basis of a dollar for every dollar of Australian value added and are subsequently used to offset duty applied to imported motor vehicles, components, replacement component parts, four-wheel drives and light commercial vehicles. Export credits can be sold or transferred amongst domestic car and component manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, the export facilitation scheme generated exports to the value of $1.2 billion. The revisions to the export facilitation scheme were implemented in 1991 by way of amendment to item 41A of schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1987. It is currently administered by the same item and corresponding by-laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item 41A allows that certain goods prescribed in by-law can be imported free of duty. The amendment, and the customs by-law in respect of item 41A as written, does not make it clear that the duty-free entitlement is only for plan producers. Of course, item 41A has always been intended to apply only to the plan participants, by allowing them duty-free importation of certain passenger motor vehicles, as well as to component producers where they have earned the appropriate number of credits under the export facilitation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has recently been contended by two importers of passenger motor vehicles that item 41A and the accompanying customs administrative by-laws allow the duty-free importation of all passenger motor vehicles, including by those companies who are not participants in the car plan&mdash;that is, those who are not domestic manufacturers. These two companies have subsequently submitted claims to the Australian Customs Service for a refund of duty paid on all vehicles imported between 1 July 1992 and 1 March 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the bill before the House seeks to clarify this situation. As such, it corrects an administrative error in the drafting of the previous amendment and, in so doing, validates existing arrangements by ensuring that only domestic manufacturers gain the benefits of export facilitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's support for this bill is purely in the interests of commonsense. We recognise the far-reaching ramifications which our opposition could pose, not only for motor vehicle importers but also, more importantly, for our domestic manufacturers.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, we recognise that our lack of support would seriously undermine industry confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In coming to a position on the bill, the coalition gave due weight to, firstly, the intent of the car plan and, secondly, the fact that the whole industry has long been operating according to the spirit and intent of the plan. The intent of the passenger motor vehicle plan and the legislation which implements the plan has been clear from the outset. It is designed to facilitate the rationalisation of the Australian industry and encourage it to become world competitive. The plan was never intended to support those importers who did not manufacture in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This intent has long been recognised by the motor vehicle industry, including both domestic producers and importers. The fact that industry has consistently complied with the intent of the plan is evidenced by its actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importers who are eligible for a refund of duty using export facilitation credits are entitled to obtain from the Australian Customs Service a determination which waives payment of duty on vehicles and components when they land on the dock. This has obvious cashflow and administrative benefits because businesses do not have to pay the duty then claim a refund. Importers who do not have export facilitation credit simply pay the duty and obtain the cargo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the companies in question genuinely believed that they were not required to pay duty on their imports, they simply would have obtained a determination from the Australian Customs Service. They would not have gone to the expense and trouble of paying duty then seeking a refund. The fact that they did not adopt this course of action indicates that the companies in question were complying with the spirit of the car plan&mdash;until the loophole was pointed out to them and they saw an opportunity to capitalise on an administrative error. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing a position on this bill, the coalition also gave due consideration to the principles applying to the assessment of retrospective legislation. As a general rule, if legislation takes away a benefit that someone was receiving, or believed they were entitled to, then it is bad legislation and should not be supported. </PARA>

We arrived at a position which, I believe, is in the best interests of the industry. But let me sound a warning: the coalition will not be as receptive if it is put in this position again. One of the fundamental principles of good government is thorough, accurate and correct legislation. Indeed, it is second only to open and accountable administration. I would welcome the assurances, not only of the new ministers for customs and industry but also of all their colleagues, that they have made a commitment to these principles and that we will not be seeing a recurrence of this situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. The purpose of the amendments contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1993 is twofold. Firstly, the amendments will put beyond doubt the construction of item 41A of schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and, in so doing, remove the possibility that a non-plan producer could import motor vehicles duty-free without export credits under the export facilitation scheme. Secondly, the amendments concern the government's policy intent under the passenger motor vehicle manufacturing plan: for an importer to benefit under paragraph 41A(a) of schedule 4 of the act, that importer must have a determination under the export facilitation scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intents and purposes of this piece of legislation have been articulated before. We must understand that there are some fairly serious implications in not proceeding with the retrospective legislation in this area. I take on board the position that has been put by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), who spoke before me in this debate. I was pleased to hear that the coalition will be supporting the retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the honourable member, the coalition has taken that position because the effect would be to impose additional costs on the community. Let me say that, unless the government proceeds with these amendments, it would be faced with a potential liability in excess of $400 million, being the combination of duty paid on passenger motor vehicles for the period 1 January 1991 to 28 February 1993 and duty forgone on plan imports for the same period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further implication of not proceeding with this retrospective legislation is that any successful circumvention of the government's policy intent by an importer could seriously undermine the benefits that have accrued to industry under the passenger motor vehicle manufacturing plan. Honourable members will be aware of the enormous benefits that the industry has generated under this plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An additional point to consider is that the industry in total has every right to expect that the plan will be maintained as previously announced by the government. These amendments, therefore, preserve the integrity of the government's automotive industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very interested in the comments that the honourable member made about this particular bill. He said that companies have attempted to capitalise on an administrative weakness in the legislation. I would have thought that they had more integrity than that; that they would have realised the advantages to the total industry of this particular plan and complied with the spirit and intent of the government's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Be that as it may&mdash;perhaps they have not pursued that particular course&mdash;the government is forced into this particular position. It is very important&mdash;indeed, essential&mdash;that the integrity of the car plan be preserved because that plan had a most beneficial influence on the development of this critical manufacturing industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's policy on the motor vehicle industry to the year 2000 was outlined in the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Building a competitive Australia</EMPHASIS>, which was brought to the Australian people in March 1991. The government's policy objectives in that document were very clearly articulated. It wanted to build a viable and internationally competitive car manufacturing industry in Australia. It also wanted the industry to produce high quality vehicles, and to bring those vehicles to the marketplace at lower real prices to the Australian consumers. I think any realistic and accurate assessment of how the industry has progressed over the last five years would indicate that the government's objectives on all of those fronts have been largely achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several essential elements of the industry arrangements were announced at that time. The first was the phased reduction in tariffs to 15 per cent by the year 2000. That did indeed contrast with the position that was put to the industry and to the Australian community by the opposition before the last federal election. It was a policy, I think it is safe to say, that was rejected certainly in my electorate, where Ford has a manufacturing facility, and in other electorates around Australia. The one important element of those industry arrangements was the modification of the export facilitation scheme. It seems from talking to people in the industry that perhaps no other measure has provided such an incentive to the industry to get into the export arena and to rake up the rather substantial exports that it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know the projections for exports in this current year are somewhere in the region of $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion. That export facilitation scheme and its continuance are absolutely vital to the future of this industry. As we know, the industry does not operate under zero tariffs. For it to operate, it requires a particular scheme that has some measure of tariff protection. In effect, the government is pursuing a policy, through the export facilitation scheme, that encourages not only passenger motor vehicle manufacturers but also component producers to get into the export ring and to clock up ever increasing levels of exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third element of that industry package was the rather generous and improved labour adjustment packages for the retraining of displaced auto industry workers. This government has prided itself on the fact that when it has had to take the hard decisions it has done so with a degree of compassion and in such a way that workers who have been displaced from an industry are given adequate retraining and are supported in the adjustment period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth element of the industry arrangement was the maintenance of the Automotive Industry Authority to monitor the arrangements under the plan; it has produced some excellent reports to the government on the status of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, the Australian motor industry is in a much healthier position than it was some five years ago. It is poised to take advantage of the emerging economic recovery both domestically and internationally. I suggest to the House that the existence of the plan, although it has had some undesirable consequences on the employment front, has certainly strengthened the industry and put it in a position where it can take advantage of an upturn in economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry's position over the past years has certainly been improved by several measures. The devaluation of the Australian dollar has provided a measure of protection which has cushioned the industry from some of the more harsh consequences of the phased tariff reductions to 15 per cent by the year 2000. Certainly the cost pressures in overseas markets that have been felt by our competitors have put the Australian industry in a far better position. Alongside this have come significant increases in productivity achieved by firms within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry's export performance is an indication of its improved competitiveness. If we review the industry today and compare it with what it was some five or 10 years ago, we now have a viable, competitive industry that is taking on the world. I think it is a tribute to the gentleman that I used to work for, former Senator John Button, who has now retired from the other place. He set in motion the various industry plans for this sector. He had the vision to set a structure and a framework that would allow this industry to become viable and internationally competitive and to sustain employment levels in the long term. If we look at the industry today, in the export area we have seen solid growth in 1992 against a background of international recession. Particularly pleasing in the growth of exports has been the growth in the component export sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the field of industrial relations performance, there has been a commendable improvement on this front. Honourable members might like to cast their minds back some years to the rather adversarial industrial relations culture which existed in this industry. It was not something I think the industry could be proud of, but I think it can be proud of its record today. The culture of the industry is changing and the level of industrial disputation in the industry is actually lower than in manufacturing industry generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One excellent result of the plan and changing culture of automotive manufacturing in Australia has been the output of quality cars. There has been a dramatic increase in the quality of Australian cars, which now match quality standards achieved by imported Japanese vehicles. I guess at this point we ought to ask the industry where it thinks it is heading under this very innovative and necessary plan that the government has put into place. I guess the answer to that lies in the investment plans that have already been articulated by the industry. It is planning to invest really heavily over the next four years. This is being done against a background of reduced profitability. The pleasing feature of that investment is that it is related to improving productive efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of productivity, we have seen some very dramatic increases in recent years. This has occurred both in assembly and component production. It is important because it is being done against a background of low levels of capacity utilisation and low levels of sales. The key to those productivity improvements has been the lean manufacturing practices that have been implemented. Factories have minimised inventories and eliminated waste. They have introduced flexibility and notions of teamwork to their work force. They have introduced motivational systems which encourage employees to contribute to the goals of the organisation. They have introduced a progressive element to their human resource management. This is paying off rather handsomely in productivity gains to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen improvements in productivity brought about by improvements to plant automation. The industry is moving from a low level of automation to a medium level of automation. That, unfortunately, has brought some labour shedding, but in the end it will position the industry vis-a-vis its competitors and will guarantee its security in the long term. The industry has been able, through its thrust into the export area, to achieve significant production volumes, and this has helped it to achieve economies of scale. The industry's future depends upon producers becoming more efficient&mdash;certainly upon its suppliers becoming more efficient&mdash;and, indeed, other players in the equation, such as government, introducing necessary reforms to position the industry so that it can become more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the micro-economic front, I think it is fair to say that the government has delivered in the areas of transport, communications, taxation and other government arrangements. On the macro scale, we have the lowest inflation rate that we have had for such a long time. We have low interest rates and we have greater work force flexibility. All of these particular elements position this industry very well to take on the challenges of the late 1990s and beyond the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should reserve some of my harshest comments tonight for members of the opposition. The honourable member who preceded me did outline with some clarity the coalition's policy on retrospective legislation, and I think certain elements of that are fair. But I think that, on the broader aspect of the policy for this industry, the opposition stands condemned. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was starting to comment on the opposition's car industry policy. I think the safest thing to say is that it does not have one. The government instituted a policy which would see a phased reduction in tariffs to 15 per cent by the year 2000. The opposition's policy is that it would phase tariffs down to zero or near to zero by the year 2000. That particular proposition was condemned by the industry; it was condemned by the unions involved in the industry; it was condemned by local governments; and it was condemned by communities which had car industry plants in their areas. Zero tariffs would have been a deterrent to the level of investment that is required to keep this industry going and make it competitive beyond the year 2000. It would have ended the export facilitation scheme which has seen an impetus to exports in the assembly and component manufacturing area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to comments that have been made by members of the opposition since this session resumed. The coalition's recent pronouncements on the car industry certainly leave a lot to be desired. In July, the shadow Treasurer and honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) claimed that Ford was considering closing its Australian factories because of poor productivity and restrictive work practices. This statement was hotly denied by Ford and the shadow Treasurer was roundly condemned by many for making it. These irresponsible, speculative statements by economic ignoramuses can have very adverse impacts on the confidence of employees in the industry and indeed on the community in which they live. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1993 amends the Customs Tariff Act 1987 to correct an error in the drafting of customs by-laws associated with item 41A of schedule 4 to the act. Item 41A of schedule 4 is concerned with the export facilitation scheme which was introduced in 1991 and allows local motor vehicle producers who are participants in the passenger motor vehicle plan to obtain export credits that can be used to offset duty on imported motor vehicles and their components.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Volvo (Australia) Pty Ltd and at least one other importer of motor vehicles are seeking to exploit this error, to claim a refund from the Australian Customs Service of duty paid on all vehicles imported over a period of about 12 months. The claimed original intent of those arrangements announced for the car plan in the 1991 industry policy statement was to deny duty-free importation to importers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is moving this amendment to operate retrospectively to deny any possibility of these claims being successful and to preserve the claimed intent of its legislation. The fact that retrospective legislation is being used once again to achieve the government's purposes should be of great concern. Until now, the coalition in opposition has steadfastly opposed the use of retrospective legislation in this way as being counter to the rule of law upon which we all ultimately rely for protection from the capricious and arbitrary actions of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, the government is asking the parliament to address problems that have arisen as a result of its delegated legislation by the use of retrospective legislation with backdated effect to the beginning of 1991. The problems this legislation seeks to eliminate could arguably have been better dealt with through the use of the Acts Interpretation Act rather than through recourse to retrospective legislation which sets a terrible precedent and is inherently dangerous to future reliance on the rule of law in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is secure in its position that its original intent was clear, it would not need to resort to retrospective legislation in order to protect itself from claims for refunds. The government contends that customs revenue at stake in this claim is around $500 million. In this case, the government has the distinct advantage of already holding these funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to compare the government's actions on this occasion with what happens when the government itself reaps a windfall gain of the type being sought by Volvo (Australia) Pty Ltd and at least one other importer. When this government is found by the courts to have illegally collected funds from taxpayers, as occurred in the Mutual Pools case, we do not see it rushing legislation through to reimburse taxpayers for those funds. Instead, we saw legislation&mdash;again retrospective&mdash;designed to negate the rights of taxpayers, given by a federal court, to a reimbursement of those funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government is not averse to keeping windfall gains when the opportunity presents itself but it is firmly against conceding revenue to taxpayers in like circumstances. It has no qualms about using retrospective legislation to achieve that end. It should also be noted that windfall gains are not an unusual feature of the operation of our customs legislation. It is quite common practice for importers to overpay customs duty to avoid penalties and subsequently to have refunds made to them. Indeed, had the importers in this case not paid the duties concerned&mdash;as they argue the law enables them to do&mdash;they would have been obliged to pay some stiff penalties had they then lost their legal argument. The effect of this legislation is to deny the importers the opportunity to mount their case before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court, which they would otherwise be entitled to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also a feature of our customs legislation is that it generally proscribes the retrospective imposition of tariff proposals or anti-dumping duties. This bill is inconsistent with those principles hitherto embodied in our customs legislation. The government has claimed that dire consequences will flow from its motor vehicle plan if this retrospective legislation is not enacted. Let me remind the House that all transactions involved here have been conducted. The action of this parliament or this government will not affect the car plan. Should the government wish to remove the loophole, as it were, prospectively, of course it would have the support of the opposition. The government does have the support of the opposition to the extent that what it proposes is prospective. So let us not hear that furphy about this legislation being integral to the success of the car plan. It is simply a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is equally a nonsense to say that the transactions which have taken place since January 1991 have given the importers a competitive advantage over local manufacturers, because those transactions have also taken place and the duty was included in the price of the product being sold by the importers. Not one sale would have been affected by these measures over that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication is that it would be unfair, or in some way damaging, to those who have participated in the export facilitation scheme if others were allowed to come along and derive similar benefits without having met the same terms and conditions that were intended to be prerequisites for obtaining those benefits. The government claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Uncertainty in the plan's legislative mechanism could seriously undermine the benefits achieved [under the car plan] to date.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a nonsense which grossly exaggerates what is at issue here. All relative commercial decisions and motor vehicle sales pertinent to this issue have already been made. Any further resort to the loophole in question can be closed off prospectively without the use of retrospective legislation. The participants in the export facilitation scheme are not going to be left any worse off as a result of the windfall gain to another party, even if that were to be the result of not passing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local producers would not have sold fewer cars than they otherwise would have, nor would the importers concerned be able to sell more cars on the Australian market without this legislation&mdash;although their profitability might be improved by the refund of customs duty. What is at issue here are claims&mdash;for as much as $500 million, according to the government&mdash;against the government that might succeed if it does not enact this retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question of the $60,000 in application fees that some importers have paid to obtain a refund of their share of those funds in accordance with the law as it stands and in accordance with accepted practice. If this legislation is passed, those application fees will be forfeited. As I have already indicated, it is possible that the government could defeat the claim for a refund of customs duty under the Acts Interpretation Act without recourse to retrospective legislation. Instead, it has chosen the dangerous course of retrospective enactment to deny such a claim and to deny the importers the opportunity to make their case. No-one would dispute that the government could use $500 million at this time to address its burgeoning budget deficit, which continues to plague the Commonwealth's finances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of us is advocating fiscal irresponsibility, but we have to ask ourselves whether the use of retrospective legislation&mdash;with all the precedents it sets and the risks that such legislation entails&mdash;is worth any amount of revenue that would otherwise be forgone. Claims against the government of a possible $500 million should instead be an expensive lesson for the government to get its delegated legislation right the first time around. Revenue potentially lost should not be an excuse to use retrospective legislation to bail the government out of trouble any, or every, time it makes a legislative mistake of this type, otherwise we really will live in an even more uncertain world with much more uncertainty than might befall local car producers if their competitors were to obtain a refund of customs revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason for not being overly concerned about the $500 million at stake here might be that the duties involved are basically obnoxious to anyone who believes that Australians should be entitled to import motor vehicles without paying a penalty to support the local industry. The importation of motor vehicles and components to this country is held hostage under the car plan to the production and export activities of local producers. It is a state of affairs about which we complain bitterly when those countries to which we export apply the same measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are massively ripped off by the government every time they buy a car in this country. They are ripped off for the sake of producers which seem to devote more energy to protecting their many local privileges than to competing in the world market. The fuel tax increases in the budget, along with the duties payable on car imports, mean that owning and operating a motor vehicle must be one of the most heavily taxed activities one can undertake in this country. It is therefore difficult to have any sympathy for local car producers should importers gain a windfall of customs revenue at the expense of government revenue. Let me say that if they should gain that windfall, it would be subject to normal company or income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of retrospective legislation is not warranted by the facts of this case. The retrospective conferral of a benefit is one thing but this legislation potentially denies a refund which the parties concerned might be entitled to under existing law. It also denies them access to justice to which we are all entitled from the government of the day. More importantly, if a tax-free transaction made yesterday were to be taxed by a law made at any time in the future, confidence in the rule of the law would be seriously diminished. </PARA>

This bill will remove a possible technical loophole in the Act which at least one producer is attempting to exploit.

Like the automatic by-law entitlement, the duty free entitlements earned under the scheme provide a cost saving to the industry.</PARA>

The response of the Fraser government to the deterioration in the competitive position of the local industry in the latter half of the 1970s was to increase protection against imported vehicles to a point where the tariff on fully assembled vehicles was 57.5 per cent in 1978. The actions of the previous Liberal government protected and insulated inefficiency, basically rewarding producers who were not having a go.

<PARA>In summary, the result has been an industry which has had rising levels of protection and declining levels of performance, circumstances which are costly to the taxpayer and damaging to the industry itself in terms of its morale, prestige, security of the work force and capacity to plan ahead.

They are designed to provide short term assistance to the industry to help it face up to the process of short term adjustment with a view to attaining greater efficiency and stability. They are designed to reduce the cost to the community and the disruptions to the industry and its employees which have occurred over the last decade. They are designed to allow an important manufacturing industry in Australia to show that it has the capacity to adapt and to do well in the domestic and international markets.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not expect much more from a rural runt such as the honourable member. Concerning the future of the industry, protection has been considerably reduced but there have been improvements in most areas of the industry, especially in relation to quality and productivity. Government initiatives in the area of micro-economic reform, combined with the stable planning environment provided by the government's passenger motor vehicle plan, give us every reason to be optimistic about the future of passenger vehicle manufacturing in this country. We could not go on as we were. Although I, among many others, am concerned about tariff reductions in many areas, the car industry approach offers some hope of managing, through change, to minimise job loss and increase exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill reduces a potential liability of the Commonwealth to refund over $400 million in duty paid by producers who are not owners of a determination under the export facilitation scheme. The retrospectivity is entirely appropriate as it merely clarifies in legislation the already clear intention of the government. The retrospectivity will not add any new costs to non-qualifying producers but it will mean that the Commonwealth will definitely not be providing windfall gains to producers who are not prepared to make a go of adjusting to an outwardly looking, world competitive industry. When we look at the way the plan is working and to the future we see likely investments of $1 billion over the next decade, through Toyota at Altona, GMH, Mitsubishi and Ford Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect I would like to focus on is industrial change in the industry. The workplace cooperation between employers and unions that this government has supported and helped initiate has seen a radical drop in the number of working days lost in the industry. Prior to these reforms, the vehicle industry was notorious for its industrial problems. In the six years to 1982, over 68,000 working days were lost due to industrial action. In the nine years to 1991 only 23,200 days were lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By any measure this is a radical drop that has occurred under a Labor government. As more companies adopt enterprise bargaining this number should continue to decline. This period was also marked by a greater degree of worker participation in workplace decision making. Ford Australia is one noteworthy case. By the end of 1988, 300 problem solving groups had been formed across Ford Australia's operations. This trend toward employee involvement has since spread into other vehicle plants. In 1991, 27 per cent of employees in Australian vehicle assembly plants were involved in employee involvement programs or quality circles. An average of 1.2 suggestions were made by each employee regarding improvements to working life or productivity, 41 per cent of which were implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we had a situation where industry was in decline, suffering from gross Liberal neglect. We introduced a car plan, and it is working. We have seen increased investment, increased exports and real change. This bill safeguards the plan's integrity. The retrospectivity is entirely justified. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my understanding that the purpose of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill is to correct a drafting error in item 41A of the Customs Tariff Act 1987&mdash;the principal act&mdash;which could allow the duty free importation of vehicles by people who do not hold a determination under the export facilitation scheme. How many times must we come into this House with legislation to fix up bad legislation and drafting errors? It happens time and time again. Part of the problem must be either that the government is incompetent or that it is in such a rush to bring in so many pieces of legislation, such massive revisions to our law and such horrendous additions to the volume of statute in this country, that it does not have time to get it right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems that business in Australia has is that we not only add constantly to the volume of laws, to the rules that prescribe how a business shall and shall not operate, but we also introduce the uncertainty of retrospective legislation. This government, and I assume the bureaucracy behind it, needs to understand that industry is in business to provide products and services that our community and other communities around the world value. Business is not in business to rip people off, to disadvantage its employees or to obtain a benefit which is beyond reasonableness. Business is in business to make products that the people need in their everyday lives or may desire to make their lives easier or more enjoyable&mdash;to give benefit to society. From that benefit, we provide real employment in this country for real people. We provide real jobs, which I note is something that the budget, which we will be discussing over the next few months, unfortunately does not address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has lost the plot. So we are here today debating retrospective legislation instead of trying to come to grips with some measures that might actually encourage industry to invest in additional productive capacity and provide meaningful jobs for Australians which will get them off the dole queues, reduce the social security bill and might actually help us to reduce our overseas debt and to become once again a profitable and wealthy nation&mdash;one where our living standards actually rise instead of fall. The government has had 10 years to get it right, but this bill is just one more example of getting it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take as an example the Swimming Pool Tax Refund Bill 1992. In 1986 the government introduced legislation which it passed through both houses of parliament to impose a sales tax on in-ground swimming pools because above-ground swimming pools were subject to a tax. It said, `Those pool builders who are building in-ground pools are obtaining advantage over the above-ground pool builders in that they do not pay tax'. The government did not understand the complex nature of the construction industry. It did not understand that a shell put into a purpose-made hole in the ground to form the base of a swimming pool is a bit different from manufacturing a vinyl liner and metal walls for an above-ground swimming pool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry had a few problems with the bill, as one might understand. Legitimate pool builders worked diligently under some mechanism or other to try to come to grips with precisely how much tax they owed for constructing the shell and digging the hole in the ground because they were the components that were to be taxed. But it was very difficult to get an exact costing on each pool for exactly those portions of that in-built pool which were to be subject to tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some unscrupulous pool builders literally just stopped paying the tax or overcharged their clients for the tax&mdash;one or the other. That put pressure on the legitimate part of the industry. The industry had finally had enough and went to the High Court. The High Court found in favour of the pool builders. It found that once again this government had made a mistake. It was not a simple drafting error that time. Section 55 of the constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . laws imposing duties of excise shall deal with duties of excise only.</PARA>
<PARA>But the Swimming Pool Tax Refund Bill did not. The High Court said that the law was invalid. So in 1992 we came into this House to debate the Swimming Pool Tax Refund Bill 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we went to debate the mechanisms proposed in that bill to deal with the refund of moneys through pool builders to pool owners and with the refund of moneys to pool builders after the time that they had issued the High Court challenge, when they stopped collecting tax from the owners&mdash;the government had got it all wrong and, potentially, hundreds of thousands of pool owners around Australia were going to be disadvantaged by the legislation&mdash;the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and his advisers could not understand how the swimming pool industry worked; how it actually operated in a practical sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no politics whatsoever in that bill. The politics went out of it once the High Court found that the government had made an error. So the fix-it-up bill was a mechanical mechanism to try to do the right thing because the High Court said that parliament had to do the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues and I tried desperately in this place, both during the second reading debate and in committee, to convince the Treasurer that he had got it wrong and that he did not understand the mechanisms of the industry. I have to say that some of my colleagues on the other side of the House stood up in this place and advised the Treasurer that perhaps he ought to listen. Did he listen? Of course not. That is our Treasurer. He does not listen because he does not believe he has anything to learn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we took it to the Senate. Fortunately for the Australian people, our house of review has other procedures and it took that bill to committee. Committee hearings were held, bringing in outside people representing various segments of the industry&mdash;owners and whatever. Finally, the Senate modified the bill, largely&mdash;although not entirely&mdash;in line with the recommendations that I had made in the House of Representatives. We then brought the amended bill back to this House, debated it again and passed it. We could have saved all that time spent on a mechanical bill&mdash;which the government should not have got wrong in the first place, but did&mdash;had the executive, as represented by the Treasurer, simply been willing to listen. But the Treasurer was not willing to listen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are we here today? We are here once again to talk about legislation which retrospectively imposes a burden or withdraws a benefit. I maintain that such a position is abhorrent. How on earth do we expect industry and Australian individuals to cope with their everyday lives, to plan for the future and to organise themselves in an efficient manner when we change the rules retrospectively? It is bad enough when we sometimes make bad laws that operate into the future; but this bill is a piece of retrospective legislation. I abhor it because it sets precedents. Every time we debate one of these issues in this place involving bad government drafting, it is because of too much haste and not enough thinking, not enough consideration of the issues involved, and a lack of understanding of industry and business and how they operate. Too many times we come back into this place to fix up bad legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill imposes a retrospective burden because the company, Volvo (Australia) Pty Ltd, which filed for duty rebate&mdash;that is why we are here&mdash;paid fees for each application that it made. It is my understanding that close to $60,000 is involved. Not only that but, were we not making this bill retrospective, other companies might also apply for duty refund, legitimately and legally as they are entitled, which happens, I understand, every day of the working week, every month of every year. Duties are constantly adjusted both up and down, down and up. This issue is not one of destroying the car plan or of destroying a legitimate car industry; it is one which now retrospectively will, if Volvo wins its case, deny that company a benefit. It effectively grants the export facilitation scheme tax credits to motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts importers who are not included in the scheme. That is to say, those who are not exporting Australian manufacturers might obtain a benefit for that brief period which the retrospectivity of this bill encompasses were it not for that portion of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that such an imposition is intolerable. I urge the government to do the right thing and at least consider refunding to Volvo the application fees it has paid, which I understand total close to $60,000. Volvo made its application in good faith, believing as it did that the legislation allowed it to ask for a refund of duty paid, and the government should refund those fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are proposals in this budget to impose in effect a retrospective burden on thousands upon thousands of Australians who have saved their long service leave and/or their holidays for a future benefit.

In between the first and second reading debates of each bill we should send the bill off to the relevant committee for consideration. The committee might decide to accept the bill as written.

I am also shocked that the opposition has learnt nothing about the way Australians feel about getting our manufacturing industry going. It is to the eternal credit of this government and former Senator Button that the car plan was introduced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill before the parliament tonight is probably more interesting due to the circumstances of its introduction than for the actual details involved. In fact, it is a bill brought before the parliament to correct some mistakes in previous legislation and consequently it draws the parliament's attention to why this is so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another piece of legislation, designed to correct mistakes in legislative drafting, which will escape the scrutiny of this parliament due simply to the limited time afforded to honourable members to properly scrutinise such legislation, both outside and inside the parliament. That is probably what escaped the understanding of the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) when he complained that recent decisions taken in the Senate would make this more difficult. I have made the point on numerous occasions before in this place that the difficulty for the parliament is in not only the time available to actually debate bills, but also the simple fact that over the years we have seen the compression of time between introduction and actual debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No politician in this place is an expert on every issue. We rely very heavily on the advice of the community and community interest groups. If very complex bills are introduced on a Thursday to be debated the following Tuesday, there is only one certainty: that those responsible, particularly in the opposition, have little time to go through the process of ensuring that the legislation is workable and that community interests are protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision taken in the Senate to demand of this House that it deals with its legislation, or at least introduces it, as early as possible will, once the parliament and the frontbench of the government come to grips with the organisational difficulties, be of benefit to everyone. In fact, it just might be that the cabinet will be able more frequently to identify mistakes of the nature that we are here to correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have previously said in this House that I consider the log jam of bills at the end of a session to be more than a conspiracy of the executive; I have always thought it to be something of a conspiracy of the bureaucracy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point to be noted about this legislation is that it seeks to pre-empt the decision of the courts. Some honourable members have referred to that situation today. Consequently, the ranting of the Prime Minister today, when he accused the opposition of wishing to overturn a decision of the High Court, as though the High Court is somehow immutable and above this parliament&mdash;more importantly, above the people&mdash;demonstrates the government's hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's actions here tonight prove that it is seeking to do no such thing. The advice given to the government is that there is a possibility, as the legislation is presently constructed, that the courts would probably overturn it. So we are here tonight to change the goalposts&mdash;retrospectively&mdash;and we are doing that for the simple purpose of ensuring that the High Court, or whatever court was involved, does not have the opportunity to do what it otherwise would have done: recommend the refund of something like $500 million to some car manufacturers or, in this case, importers of fully built vehicles. They would have the money refunded and, presumably, it would then have filtered back over time to the people, the purchasers of vehicles. </PARA>

I guess only time will tell whether the car industry workers, many of whom would have voted Labor, backed the right horse at the last election when one looks at what has happened to their industry in this budget. The first act of the government is to make it a lot more expensive for people to drive all vehicles, and it is making it a lot more expensive to buy vehicles. These problems will impact directly on the industry's ability to do business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The car industry is still delicately poised; it is certainly not in boom times. It astounds me that the government has chosen to affect the industry's future viability in this way as compared with other issues. There is no doubt that the recent devaluations of the Australian dollar have been beneficial to the car industry. We were proposing to take about $800 off the up-front manufacturing costs of the industry. I cannot work out why its cost accountants were not able to work out that that was a far better proposition than the one it accepted&mdash;some five or 10 per cent differential in tariff by the year 2000. Within two years of coming to office, we would have reduced the operating costs of building a car in Australia by $800. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether it be in the wine industry, in the car industry or in any other situation today, the issue is import competition. It is nice to mouth off about exports&mdash;thank goodness we have them and thank goodness they are growing. But the simple fact of life is that no industry will survive in any country without a well-established local market. The wine industry is trying to tell the government that, although it does not seem to be able to understand it. Of course, there is no basis for the possibility of exporting motor vehicles unless the local market is as large and as profitable as possible for our car producers. This is the other side of the equation. </PARA>

They pay payroll tax and they put a profit on their payroll tax, the BHP payroll tax and the miners' payroll tax.

Manufacturers who were properly entitled to benefits as a corollary to the export of vehicles or components receive those benefits throughout the period in question. Those who are not entitled to the benefits pay the appropriate duty on relevant importations.

In March 1991, the government announced an enhancement of the passenger motor vehicle manufacturing plan by providing for component manufacturers to be able to use export credits they had earned under the plan with effect from 1 January 1991.

The importer or the consultant, depending on what interpretation one places on the remarks of the honourable member for Curtin, was told on 22 February 1993 that the issue was beyond doubt and that legislation would be put into effect to remove any doubt with respect to this particular legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's car plan is one of the best known and long established of its industry plans. The government, through the then industry minister, former Senator John Button, introduced the car plan, as the honourable member for Curtin well knows, back in May 1984. This plan was aimed at establishing an internationally competitive automotive industry which provided Australians with quality, affordable cars. Under the plan, quotas which had provided very high, effective levels of protection were to be phased out over eight years and the tariff set at 57.5 per cent. An export facilitation scheme for the five plan producers of passenger motor vehicles at that time was established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early 1988, a mid-term review of the car plan was undertaken which concluded that the devaluation of the Australian dollar in the mid-1980s provided an opportunity to increase the pace of restructuring of the industry. Accordingly, tariff quotas were abolished and the tariff was reduced to 45 per cent, reducing annually by 2.5 per cent to 35 per cent in 1992. Increased limits on credits earned under the export facilitation scheme were made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In accordance with the 1988 announcement, the future of the car plan&mdash;that is, post-1992&mdash;was reviewed by the Industry Commission late in 1990, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of the new policy were essentially the same as those put forward in the original car plan. The principal elements of the new policy were, firstly, a continuation of the rate of tariff phasing of 2.5 per cent on imports of passenger motor vehicles and original equipment components, leading to a 15 per cent tariff by the year 2000. The tariff is currently 32.5 per cent and will be 30 per cent next year. Secondly, there was the removal of restrictions on the earning and direct use of export credits, including by component producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The elements of the car plan, in particular the tariff rates applicable on imports, and the operation of the export facilitation scheme, have been clearly understood and accepted by the automotive industry. That is the point I want to make to the honourable member for Curtin, for whom I have much respect, but he is wrong on this issue. Under the current policy, the industry has been transformed into an export industry. Automotive exports were worth $1.2 billion in 1992, as other speakers have stated. Component manufacturers have developed as a result of the policy which has facilitated access to the internal markets of the international automotive companies. For example, the emission control supplier, Johnson Matthey Ltd, signed contracts in the last year worth $400 million for the export of catalytic converters to Rover, Peugeot and Jaguar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, the gap in quality between local and imported vehicles has been closed, as the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) rightly observed. Mitsubishi now exports vehicles to Japan, the United States and Germany. The value of vehicle exports is expected to be $350 million in 1993. Toyota's Australian plant is ranked second among Toyota plants worldwide in quality&mdash;and all credit to Mr Johnston. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Toyota expects that almost one-third of its Altona production will be exported, building up to a value of $600 million by the year 2000. Current forecasts for local car makers indicate real investment growth of 19 per cent in the 1993-96 period compared with 1989-92, reaching the projected level objective of $2 billion. Government policies have succeeded in producing a strong passenger motor vehicle industry with the lowest levels of protection in Asia outside Japan. The rules were well known to the members of the plant. The industry well knew what the rules were. No loss has been suffered by anyone, none at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) obviously had the chance to look at my remarks if he were not listening attentively when I spoke and to hear exactly what I said. He chose not to do that and to imply meaning which would not be gleaned from the words I actually used in my speech at the second reading stage. It is therefore unfortunate that he seeks to base a case on some misunderstanding that he may have had about what I actually said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he did say in his rather lamentable justification of the government's approach to this matter is that intention is irrelevant. That seems to me strange, because it was specifically mentioned in the second reading speech of the parliamentary secretary. It was a main plank of justification for retrospective legislation. Apparently, in the meantime, the parliamentary secretary has had some advice from his advisers in the box and he has said, `The Acts Interpretation Act has no application here'. For what reason, he did not make plain. Let me tell the parliamentary secretary that, if it were not a matter of intention on which the Collector of Customs was to rely, the collector certainly gave that impression to the claimants of refunds. They were made certain in no obscure terms whatsoever that the existing legislation was adequate. That being the case, I argued&mdash;and so did others on this side&mdash;that it should be a matter for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to determine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Failing satisfaction on the part of the claimants with that decision or any decision from the AAT, the claimants may then, under procedures laid down in the relevant customs legislation, refer the matter to the Federal Court. What could be fairer than that? One goes to the court and one gets a decision. If one cannot rely on intention&mdash;and the parliamentary secretary has admitted that he cannot and did not rely on that in his main plank justification for the legislation&mdash;let the matter go before the respective tribunals. The truth is that this matter is a stuff-up. It is parallel to what the then Commissioner of Taxation did to the coalition government in relation to bottom of the harbour schemes way back in the early 1980s. The commissioner came along and said, `I haven't got the law to deal with these crooks'. They were crooks; no-one denies that the perpetrators of the schemes were crooks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Jenkins)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! I remind the honourable member for Curtin that the third reading debate is a rather narrow debate which should be to the final form and content of the bill. He should not too widely reopen the second reading debate. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not mention that matter in the second reading debate, nor did anyone else. To quickly get off the point, the commissioner came back, got his retrospective legislation, then found in a subsequent court decision that he had jurisdiction under section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The point I really wanted to make in the narrow confines of the bill was that the bureaucracy will come back to its ministers and say that it wants more law when it already has adequate law. I suggest that that is the situation in this case. At least the adequacy of the existing law should be tested. It never has been, although the Collector of Customs said to the claimants&mdash;and to all and sundry I understand who have bothered to ask&mdash;that the law as it stood was adequate, and that the claims were bound to fail. Instead, the government has resorted to retrospectivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that the minister has gone on to do&mdash;because it is part of the rhetoric and the propaganda, and I guess there is an excuse for that&mdash;is to refer to the car plan. This has absolutely no relevance to the efficacy or otherwise of the car plan. If the claims submitted by importers were successful, and there is a question mark about that, it has no effect on the car plan at all. It is all history. The sales have been made; it has nothing to do with what has happened in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not affect the competitiveness of the local producer against the imported product. It has got nothing to do with that at all. I understand that he wants to make a political point about the car plan, but I stress that it has got nothing to do with this legislation whatsoever. It is quite irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would prefer to let the court decide, without the government resorting to retrospective legislation. The Collector of Customs seems to be so confident in his position. I am not a lawyer, but I would tend to agree with his assessment. It was the intention of the government in its original legislation to close off any opportunity for importers to escape duty. If that is the case, let it be sorted out before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. If the plaintiffs or claimants in that case were not happy with the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal let them, at their expense and at great risk of incurring substantial expense, put it before the Federal Court. Let the Federal court decide. We do not have to resort to retrospective legislation when there is perfectly adequate law already in place and the adequacy of that law is admitted by the bureaucracy in the person of the Collector of Customs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to speak on the resumption of the debate on one of the worst budgets ever presented to this parliament, Labor's 1993 budget of betrayal. Rarely in Australian political history has a budget been as quickly deserted and in many ways destroyed as has been the 1993 budget of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) is at the table. Typical of reaction to the budget all around the countryside is an article in a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rockhampton Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. Under the heading `Under Siege' there is a photo of the Assistant Treasurer and the very marginal Labor honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell). And they are under siege. The Assistant Treasurer was trying to defend the indefensible and, of course, he failed in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As things stand, the Treasurer does not yet know what is in or what is out of his budget presented a fortnight ago. This is the Treasurer who said that the budget was not a negotiating document. Negotiations are going on in the morning, the afternoon and the evening. The famous right wing meeting this morning concluded with a list of demands of what was and was not acceptable to it in the changes sought to be brought about in this budget. Just a fortnight later, the whole budget is up for grabs. Since the time Martin Ferguson made the statement in plain English, `It is impossible to defend the indefensible', the writing has been on the wall in relation to this budget. Now we know that the whole document has collapsed like a pack of cards and along with it any shred of credibility that the Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and indeed the whole government ever had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to go to the Senate tonight and listen to the debate on the budget and hear Senator Sandy Macdonald making his maiden speech. Not only those in both houses of parliament but those in just about every house in the landscape of Australia realise they have been sold a dud with this budget of betrayal. They are angry about this budget and they want to see the parliament react to the budget in a responsible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to address some of the specifics of the budget. In relation to the matter of fuel, the fuel excise tax increases were an ill-considered and regressive slug on all Australians. Despite the government's fall back position on fuel, the fuel excise increase on leaded fuel of 7c a litre will raise an additional $4.9 billion in revenue, which means more than $8 billion in terms of total fuel excise for this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an absolutely outrageous tax slug on Australian motorists, poor Australians, drivers of leaded vehicles, Australian farmers and, above all else, Australian exporters. These costs will be passed through the production chain at every level. Further, they discriminate against those who live outside the capital cities and whose goods are transported sometimes long distances before they are purchased. It should not go unnoticed that, just to rub motorists' noses in it, whilst the government is raking off more and more from motorists it is spending less and less on road funding, including roads in the Ipswich area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In return for increasing fuel excise the government is slashing road funding by about half over two years. Commonwealth road funding in 1992-93 is set at $1.6 billion, whilst the budget papers tell us that the estimate for road funding for the next financial year will in fact come down to $813 million. That is a halving of the federal road funding commitment at a time when the road infrastructure across so much of Australia is under great duress and in need of upgrading and modernisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, Labor is absolutely ripping off Australian motorists and the road transport industry. In order to disguise this outrageous increase in fuel taxes, the government tried the argument that this was all for the benefit of Australian children. In this House just over a week ago the Treasurer said that the decision regarding fuel excise on leaded fuel was made `essentially for health reasons' because he was `concerned about the deleterious effects on the intellectual capacity of young children'. Who will forget the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) saying that the fuel tax decision was made `primarily because we want to protect the children of Australia'. What has happened in the last few days? Well might we ask. What has happened about Australian children? The arguments go on in relation to the fuel tax. This government will do anything and say anything to justify increased taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we do know about increasing fuel excise is that it is particularly damaging on those whom Labor calls the true believers. It is those who are less well off, who live on the fringes of our large cities, such as Ipswich, and who therefore have to spend a higher proportion of their income on petrol, who will suffer most, including those also beyond Balranald, Burke and Burketown. It is those in rural and regional Australia&mdash;and not too many of them are wealthy, thanks to Labor&mdash;who have to spend a high proportion of their income on petrol. The decision is not too bad for those living in Mosman, Woollahra or Elizabeth Bay. Firstly, they do not spend nearly as much on petrol; and secondly, it is more likely they will have a new car which uses unleaded fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, there have been some interesting statistics on this from the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority. In areas like Chatswood and Castlecrag, fuel outlets dispense 60.9 per cent of their product in the form of unleaded fuel. But at Windsor or Richmond only 28.8 per cent of their output is for unleaded fuel. It is a huge disparity, I admit. Areas where more than 50 per cent of fuel usage is unleaded include Woollahra, Mosman, North Sydney, Kur-ing-gai and Lane Cove. In contrast, only 37.4 per cent of vehicles use unleaded fuel in the local government area of Bankstown&mdash;that is the Prime Minister's electorate&mdash;in areas such as Yagoona, Greenacre and Revesby. Pity help the so-called true believers because they are the ones being slugged outrageously and regressively by the very nature of the original proposed fuel excise tax arrangements under this budget&mdash;and the ones who, it would seem, continue to be slugged under the adjustments which are still unfolding at 9 o'clock tonight following a further round of crisis meetings with the right wing caucus, the Australian Democrats, the Greens and just about everybody else. This is the budget that has been rewritten on the hour, every hour, ever since it was produced in this House by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the wine industry. The application of the budget's sales tax slug on the wine industry represents a real and major threat to this vibrant industry. The point should be made that the wine industry is highly value added&mdash;up to 7 1/2 times farm gate value. Honourable members will remember how often we have been lectured by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) on value adding, and here he is slapping down one of the true great value adding industries of Australia&mdash;the Australian wine industry. To lumber the industry with additional taxes&mdash;growers already pay a levy applied by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation&mdash;in addition to a failure to deliver on improvements to the national infrastructure is appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be recalled that only one-seventh of the cost of a bottle of wine is that of the grape. The rest is attributable to labour costs, transport, processing and containers. It is this proportion of cost&mdash;that is, the remaining six-sevenths of the cost of wine&mdash;that bears the brunt of the government's failure to address the problems of infrastructure. In terms of export, in addition to the overheads associated with the production of a bottle of wine, waterfront charges are likely to be well in excess of Australia's European or United States competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the domestic scene? Costs of electricity, road improvements and telecommunications are all well in excess of the product's competitors elsewhere in the world. Allied with this is the fact that many of the industry's producers are well within the small business sector and can ill-afford the costs that are being increasingly added on to the Australian wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important factor associated with this industry is that costs are still being borne during the period before any crops are produced. It takes five years or more before any investment is realised by the wine producer. All of this time, the producer&mdash;the small business person whom the government says it recognises as the key to Australia's prosperity; more so because he is an important exporter&mdash;is being driven further into debt. He will be kneecapped on the vital domestic market by a sales tax increase, which is some 55 per cent, lifting the sales tax rate as we speak from 20 to 31 per cent. But honourable members should not hold their breath, because this budget is under massive surgery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) quite rightly has strongly highlighted the impact that this particular measure will have on the Murrumbidgee irrigation area and so many of the wineries of the Riverina, just to nominate one area. The Australian wine industry is a major contributor to regional growth in the Mallee region, the Riverina region or even the Hastings area and elsewhere. It provides a labour intensive source of employment to many people across Australia. However, at the outset the government fails to deliver on a promise for the wine industry and, indeed, by bringing in this huge sales tax increase, jeopardises the export growth of this wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, Brown Brothers at Milawa has gone from nowhere to everywhere, and is today generating some $5 million of exports annually. This tax increase will kneecap that export operation. So ignorant is Treasurer Dawkins that he said today that sales tax does not apply to exports. He is even wrong on that score. It does not apply to exports directly, but indirectly sales tax applies to large sections of the freight component. Brown Brothers wine has to be shifted from Milawa to the airport to bring about its export. Let us have less nonsense from the government. Let us get in there and protect a great and vibrant industry from the treatment it is being given by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us also look at the tax treatment of leave. Michael Easson, who can hardly be described as a supporter of conservative causes, said that the budget was an `act of bastardry'. It was more than just the build-up to the ACTU congress, which the Prime Minister will address tomorrow. It has had to pull out every stop to ensure that there is no walkout when the Prime Minister walks into the ACTU congress tomorrow. It will still be a near thing, but no doubt the ACTU will stitch a deal to ensure that there is no walkout on the Prime Minister, although the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) might not get through so smoothly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Retrospective taxation of leave is offensive as a principle. It is an offensive, unfair and unjust tax. Government members know it. That is why they had their crisis right wing caucus meeting today. Just a few days ago a New South Wales policeman came to see me in my Albury electorate office. I will tell honourable members what he told me about the Treasurer's budget. He said that for every minute Treasurer Dawkins was speaking he was dropping $600 of his savings. This is a man who has served the community for decades, who has given dedicated service in a series of postings around Sydney and country areas, who has planned his savings on an appropriate interpretation of the law as it stands and who has accrued these long service leave and annual leave entitlements. The government will strip this man of $20,000 under the original budget version mark 1, although he might get a slightly fairer deal under budget mark 2. But he is just one of thousands of examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the defence forces&mdash;navy, army and air force personnel&mdash;will be hit hard, especially as they come from organisations whose culture is not to take long service leave. Many of them are not permitted to take long service leave and will now be hit so hard by the tax treatment on accrued annual leave and long service leave. It is grossly unfair, especially on those servicemen who are serving tonight in Cambodia, the Sahara, the Middle East or elsewhere, that they will suddenly have this ripped off them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members should think again. They will have to, because the Senate will force them to do so. It is an absolute disgrace that the Treasurer came in here in the first place with a retrospective grab at the savings of workers. He should hang his head in shame for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the total lack of strategy in the 1993 budget. The Australian public can understand the need for pain if there is a clear sense of strategy, if there is some gain at the end of the day. But this budget is blowing out because of the irresponsible and undeliverable promises which Labor made during the election campaign. The government never thought that it would have to deliver on them. We have only to read the Prime Minister's famous Friday night speech on election eve. Some ministers were in deep shock on Sunday morning&mdash;I confess I was in deep shock for the opposite reason&mdash;because they won the election they did not expect to win. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has had to deliver a budget that basically says, `We'll deliver X, Y and Z, but you'll be paying more tax on leaded and unleaded petrol, diesel, wine and so forth'. The government wants to go to the Australian people and say to them, `We are delivering on our promised tax cuts'. Worse still, we go through all this pain and all these tax increases; and at the end of the day what are we left with? We are left with a budget which is still $16,000 million in the red this year and with very little prospect in real terms of getting out of that debt bind over the next four years, the period for which some aspects of the budget documents apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that we have all this pain and very little gain. We have a savage deficit which will do great harm to Australia and to future generations of Australians who will be forced to pay off this debt. That is mirrored by some of the figures released today. It is in every way, shape and form an ugly, unfair, unjust and unwarranted budget which does little to provide the strategic thinking, the strategic vision, which will get this country back on its feet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget does little for the export sector as well. Yes, there are some specific programs in relation to boosting trade, with some $99 million to be expended over several years, coming down to about $30 million a year. The truth of the matter is that the sales tax increases on the domestic market directly, and indirectly on exports, and the fuel excise tax increases, especially on diesel, wipe out any gain which might be afforded by the programs provided for under the budget. In other words, we might be taking one small step forward on the trading front&mdash;and this country needs to boost its export sector in fundamental terms&mdash;but we are taking about 20 steps backwards when the total impact of the budget is examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members think they can be complacent about the balance of payment figures today, they certainly cannot. In real terms, imports are still out of kilter in comparison with our export effort. But think of it in another way: are we really getting on top of best international practice? The truth of the matter is that, according to a recent BCA study, we are not. The study made detailed research of five industries&mdash;electricity, rail freight transport, telecommunications, road freight transport and the waterfront. I quote from John Ralph's letter arising from this study. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The results of the studies to date (with the exception of the road freight study) are not encouraging.

<PARA>The BCA produced a detailed table as proof of that. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two most recent studies&mdash;road freight transport and waterfront (ports), show that government taxes and port authority charges have operated against the competitiveness of Australian industry as they are substantially higher in Australia than in overseas countries . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) has given many examples, especially comparing New Zealand practice and performance with Australian practice and performance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I was hoping that the Leader of the National Party would give me some substantial matters to respond to. Unfortunately he has not been able to deliver. That is not surprising because National Party members were running around in the last election wanting to tax everything that moved and everything that did not move, particularly food items, with the proposed goods and services tax. They really have no credibility when they stand up here and start talking about taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party referred to current speculation around the place&mdash;it has been covered by the media well enough tonight; I am sure he would have looked at that as well&mdash;about proposed changes to the budget strategy. That is important. Honourable members can get those news briefs off the computers in their offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many budgets often have areas which people look at after the budget, and discussions go on. Those discussions have been proceeding and genuine concerns have been expressed by a number of people in our community, as honourable members quite rightly point out. We really have to look at the budget itself. Budget strategy must be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis in this budget is the need to reduce our deficit. A commitment has been made to reduce the deficit to one per cent of our GDP by 1996-97. If there have to be some minor changes in the areas contemplated tonight in many media broadcasts and in questions to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) today, they are important matters which should be looked at. It shows that this government is prepared to listen to the people, which is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are areas of concern, the government is prepared to sit and listen to those people and will do something about those genuinely held concerns. I believe that at the end of the day when these matters are sorted out everyone will be a lot happier. But the government must maintain the general strategy of the budget: to address the deficit problems. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I was rudely interrupted, I was responding to some of the comments made by the Leader of the National Party.

I was saying that this government is prepared to listen to the genuinely held concerns of the community, not the non-genuinely held concerns of members of the National Party, who really had nothing to deliver here tonight in response to the Leader of the National Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Surely not. Do not call them back, they will be right. They have probably heard it all before. As those opposite are well aware, the budget contains a whole range of taxation measures. I make no apologies for some of those measures being directed to middle income earners because they need some assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past decade, the federal government has implemented a whole range of initiatives designed to assist low income earners. I refer to family payments and Austudy. Middle income earners need to be picked up in those areas. Middle income families have missed out on many of the benefits of these programs due to income and asset tests which apply to these benefits. Reducing personal income tax rates is one way of giving financial assistance to those families. Generally speaking, those families need assistance with their education and health, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to tax cuts, this budget includes other measures. Let us look at the positive things. When we look at the budget, we ought to look at the whole budget. The problem is that those opposite look at bits and pieces and home in on the negatives instead of looking at the big picture, which is absolutely important. They know that, but will not admit it. That is nothing unusual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget includes a whole range of measures that will be of great benefit to working families; in particular, refinements to the government's child-care program and the payment of an allowance to women who choose to stay at home to care for their children. As from 1 July next year, families with children in child care will be able to take advantage of a tax rebate of up to $28.10 per week for one child and up to $61.20 for two or more children in care. From 1 September, families where one parent stays at home to look after the children will be eligible for the home child-care allowance of $30 per week announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in February. Over 840,000 families are expected to benefit from the home child-care allowance, while over 230,000 families will benefit from the cash rebate for child care. A substantial number of families in my electorate will benefit from such an initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the tax cuts and child-care assistance will give welcome relief to those in work, the number one priority of this government remains assisting the unemployed back into the work force. With my colleagues on this side of the House, I have a very strong commitment to that initiative. Last week, in my electorate, a member of the opposition took the opportunity to bag the unemployed and accuse them of not really wanting to look for work. That is certainly not true in my area, and I am sure it is not the case with people right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget contains a number of measures which will directly assist unemployed people in their efforts to enter the work force. The $120 million increase in spending on labour market programs will be of assistance in promoting employment growth. The reduction in income tax will generate employment either directly or indirectly because of the extra cash that will be available to consumers to spend. Those measures are disregarded entirely by those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have devoted a great deal of time to finding ways of promoting employment growth in my own electorate&mdash;and nationally as well. In May this year I established my own local employment advisory group to assist in ways which could help me and the government's employment task force&mdash;which is jointly chaired by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) and the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford)&mdash;to help the unemployed. The members of my local advisory group have met with local employers, training providers, officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, and members of the trade union movement to gauge the effectiveness of current government employment policies in my region. The group is currently finalising a submission to the government's committee on employment opportunities. While as a whole the government's employment and labour market programs have been quite successful, it is important that the effectiveness of these programs be constantly reviewed to ensure that resources are not wasted, and that funds go to areas that will create the most jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate of Oxley&mdash;with its well-established training network including the Regional Development Corporation, three skillshare programs, group training schemes and private trainers&mdash;is well placed to pick up on the initiatives outlined in this budget. I will certainly be encouraging the pick-up of those initiatives as much as I can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget will establish a $3 million community activity program that will assist up to 7,000 unemployed people this financial year through a number of pilot programs throughout Australia. These programs will enable people to gain valuable work experience in the community sector. The program will add an important new dimension to the range of opportunities available for unemployed people to maintain their attachment to, and active involvement in, the world of work. Local organisations, such as the Ipswich mates skillshare program, which already operates its own volunteer program, are in an excellent position to take advantage of that. I am hoping it will become the pilot program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expansion of the new enterprise incentive scheme, which provides financial assistance and advice for unemployed people who want to establish a small business, will also directly benefit unemployed people in my electorate and in many other parts of Australia. In the past two years, over 40 new small businesses have started in the Ipswich region under this program. It is a real success story. A high proportion of people who started a business under the program are still going strong&mdash;and that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expansion of the successful group training schemes is also welcome news for the Ipswich region, containing as it does the Ipswich and Moreton community apprenticeship scheme&mdash;IMCAS&mdash;which has played an important role in finding employment opportunities for young apprentices who would otherwise be unable to complete their apprenticeships. That organisation also undertakes a whole number of traineeships as well, which is of particular assistance to people wishing to follow a career through the traineeship program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to provide some 10,000 commencements under the landcare and environment action program&mdash;LEAP&mdash;at a cost of $65.5 million is also welcome news, as this program was already operating effectively in my community. Last week I had the pleasure of attending a morning tea with some 11 young people involved in the Denmark environmental park project, in the middle of the city of Ipswich, under LEAP. That shows the success of those programs. These young people are learning skills including bush regeneration, plant identification, weed removal, selective tree planting, landscaping and horticulture. In addition, they are also undertaking training in carpentry, the use of chainsaws, and trail construction activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person who is supervising that group trained under the jobskills program with the Ipswich City Council, and he is now a trainer himself. That is another success story of one of the government's labour market programs. Participants in the project will also undergo off-the-job training in subjects including plant identification and culture, nursery practices, and landscape practices. The Denmark Hill project is one of a number of projects currently under way under LEAP in the Ipswich region, with 49 young people currently participating in the program and a further 50 to commence very shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $10 million increase in federal funding for LEAP in this year's budget is just one of the initiatives that will promote employment opportunities in many parts of Australia. The $13.2 million expansion of jobclubs and the $19.5 million for the new enterprise incentive scheme is good news for many people seeking employment. In addition to the direct assistance for the unemployed, there is also a package of measures designed to increase business competitiveness and encourage businesses to take on additional employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While labour market programs play an important role in assisting the unemployed back to work, it will only be through private sector investment that sustained employment growth of the level required to substantially reduce the unemployment rate will occur. The reduction of the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, along with the introduction of a development allowance and a $94 million package to encourage export development by small and medium sized firms, will provide further incentive for business to invest and provide further job opportunities. With inflation at its lowest level for 30 years, and interest rates at their lowest for 20 years, these measures will be of great assistance to business. I encourage businesses to take full advantage of them and give those people who desperately need those jobs a chance of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure which has positive implications for my electorate is the establishment of a regional tourism development program. The $42 million regional tourism package, which includes expenditure of $23 million on a regional tourism development program, will involve the provision of grants to local governments, tourism associations, and regional development bodies for regional tourism projects. These projects will involve the development of strategic regional plans that analyse the present position of their regional tourism industry, as well as opportunities for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the regional tourism development program, grants will also be available for projects that enhance existing tourism attractions. Other elements of the regional tourism package include expenditure of $10 million on the implementation of the national ecotourism strategy, and $9 million for three programs to facilitate growth in niche marketing, and for the establishment of a tourism forecasting council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing that the government has recognised the need for further funds to promote the growth of the regional tourism sector. The growth of the tourism industry has been one of the great economic success stories of the past decade, with the industry now providing a large proportion of Australia's export income. Unfortunately, two-thirds of international visitors who currently holiday in Australia do not spend a night outside of the capital cities or the international gateways such as the Gold Coast or Cairns. A number of organisations in my own region have recognised the potential benefits that would flow to the area through further development of the region's tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the funding from the local capital works program announced in last year's budget went to projects that will increase my region's attractiveness as a tourism destination. The regional tourism development program will be of further assistance in the development of the growing tourism industry in many parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to one point which is of extreme importance to us all. In this International Year for the World's Indigenous People the budget continues the government's record of support for policies which aim to achieve economic and social justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Funding for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission&mdash;ATSIC&mdash;will increase by 10 per cent to $867 million this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will spend $73 million on implementing its response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which represents an increase of $18 million over the last financial year. Funding for the community development employment project, the CDEP, will be increased by 9.9 per cent. This remains ATSIC's single biggest program. Currently the scheme involves over 22,000 people and 218 communities across Australia. The scheme is a real alternative to the unemployment benefit for many Aborigines and Torres Strait Islander people, and shows the determination of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders to take control over their own lives and destinies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national Aboriginal health strategy, which has improved the poor health status of indigenous people, will also be boosted by $25.8 million to $70.123 million. Overall, the budget demonstrates the government's continued confidence in ATSIC and its commitment to the process of reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also continued its support for ex-service personnel and their families, with an increase in funding for the Department of Veterans' Affairs of $220 million, bringing the total budget of the department to $5.62 billion. The changing needs of the ageing veterans community has meant a change in the programs offered by the government through the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget delivers on the government's election commitment to make available a seniors health card to all veterans, spouses and carers who meet the age requirements and are eligible for a service pension but whose assets are greater than the limit allowed under the assets test for the pension. From 1 July next year ex-service personnel in possession of a seniors health card will be entitled to benefits including cheaper pharmaceuticals under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, a free hearing aid from the Australian Hearing Service, a two-stage dental scheme for emergency and general dental health services, and optometry services under Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we look at the whole spectrum of this budget and its full ramifications, rather than just cover the negatives as the opposition has done. I commend the budget to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They then found that they got indirect taxes on unleaded and leaded petrol, increased wholesale sales taxes, wine taxes, and tax on accrued leave. They feel angry, betrayed and let down. Every time the government goes back through these quotes and tries to pull out something which justifies what it has done the people feel angrier and angrier. It is this refusal to actually face up to it and acknowledge it&mdash;the justifications&mdash;that make it worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which the government is carrying on now is the reason why 82 per cent of Australians, according to the opinion polls, think that the government has broken its promises. There has never been a figure like that in the history of opinion polls: 82 per cent of Australians saying that the government has broken its promises, and eight per cent saying that they do not know. Try to find the remaining 10 per cent!  For the parliamentary secretary to sit there and carry on as he has, with false justifications, does not make it any better. He ought to acknowledge the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find out that the whole thing is predicated on the government saying, `Look, it may not be all that good this year but we can get the deficit back to one per cent by 1996-97. Don't worry about things in the interim'. The Commonwealth deficit might be heading north when it should be going south but we are told not to worry; that it will all be back by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the budget papers, one sees how that is done. It is all done on the back of the GDP numbers for four years&mdash;figures which are put out at artificially high levels to produce a good result in four years time. That is the same trick that was being pulled at the time of the One Nation statement. At that time the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So let's say we say, oh look 4 per cent is too ambitious, we'll go back to 2 3/4 per cent , so that means we won't even take the new entrants to the workforce, so we'd have a continuing rise in unemployment . . . </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are figures&mdash;again, it is the same trick&mdash;appearing for the outward years. But when one looks at the budget fine print, the Treasury does not stand by these figures at all. Page 1.2 of Budget Paper No. 1 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The values attached to major economic indicators . . . for the outyears are necessarily indicative and do not constitute a forecast.</PARA>
<PARA>They are not even forecasts. The government has predicated the whole return for 1996-97 on four per cent growth rates which the budget itself will not even say is a forecast. It calls it `necessarily indicative'. This is the way the One Nation statement was cobbled together. The word `forecast' disappeared and the word `projection' started to appear. Now we are talking about `necessarily indicative' numbers but not `forecasts'. That is how the government does the pea and thimble trick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to concentrate on the $16 billion deficit. Who knows where it is now? We were supposed to have savings, from knocking off Medicare benefits for optometry tests, of $50 million. That has gone. We were supposed to have revenue from retrospective tax on unused leave. That has gone. There was to be more revenue from the 10c a litre on leaded petrol. That now looks like 7c. Who knows what the budget actually says about the deficit now. Even the budget figure of $16 billion includes asset sales. Asset sales are being treated as revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the whole history of the Labor Party's asset sales program, it has never brought its asset sales in on budget. In 1991 it was saying it would get $1 billion and it got $161 million. In l991-92 it said $625 million; it got $300 million. Last year it was going to get $1.6 billion; it got $800 million, which is 50 per cent. Now it is saying it will get $2.4 billion. Who knows how much it will get. Even if it does get it, selling off assets like Commonwealth Bank shares cannot be called negative outlay or revenue. It is selling off an asset and using it for the year's income. No reputable company would be allowed to do that. That would not be permitted in a prospectus. Companies that start selling capital assets and applying them to current year income are generally marked down for receivership. Everybody knows that that is the last act of a company heading for receivership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the government pulls money out of GBEs&mdash;out of Australia Post and Telecom&mdash;which means one of two things: they either run down their infrastructure or they put up their charges. The government gets $850 million out of that. It gets $3.2 billion out of the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank actually makes money on the foreign exchange market, punting on a falling Australian dollar. Talk about speculators in the international market! The Reserve Bank turns an abnormal profit because the dollar is falling; it is selling foreign reserves and getting more. The government is running down the contingency reserve. As private sector forecasters are saying, the Commonwealth budget deficit is probably nearer the $23 billion mark. It is over five per cent of GDP. It is the worst deficit&mdash;worse than the Whitlam experiment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where the government is. We have heard all this talk about reducing outlays but where are they? Where are the reduced outlays? One measure was cutting Medicare benefits for optometry. The budget papers said that, in real terms, the outlays were going to go up by 3.9 per cent. People in Australia should think about this, about why there is a bigger deficit when the government has all these new taxes. It is not because it is reducing outlays. If there are all these new taxes and the government is reducing outlays, the deficit should be falling&mdash;but it is increasing. According to the budget, in real terms it is 3.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have increased petrol tax, wine tax, wholesale sales tax, a tax on annual leave, but we still have a bigger deficit. The Australian people feel cheated, bruised and betrayed. As Martin Ferguson said, `How do you defend the indefensible?'. That is quite right. There have been many backbenchers, and the parliamentary secretary too, making a meal of trying to defend the indefensible in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst thing about the budget is that it falls heaviest on average Australians, average wage earners. Those opposite know this. That is what is being said in the caucus economics committee, to which 60 people turned up tonight, where people talk freely. The optometry measure was always going to be a disaster. The Australian Optometrical Association said that. It was based on a whole lot of assumptions that will not come in. The fact is that if a cut-off date is announced a lot of people will come forward to have their tests. People will swap between optometry and ophthalmological services. There were also false assumptions made in relation to the percentage of people who have been on health care cards. That was always a saving that was going to evaporate. As a result, it is now dead. It was all pain for no gain. The Australian people feel like that: all pain for no gain. All these increased taxes; and where is the gain? Where are the jobs? Unemployment at the end of the year is as bad; foreign debt is worse; the current account is worse; the budget deficit is worse; and inflation is worse. So where is the gain in this budget?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister used to call himself the Placido Domingo of Australian politics. He is no Placido Domingo of Australian politics. He is the Pinocchio of Australian politics. The Australian public knows that. They heard all of those promises. The government should not try to tell them what it thinks it said. The people know what they heard. What they heard before the election was that the Prime Minister could give it all to them, and he has not. They feel betrayed. I say to the caucus economics committee, `You are quite right, it is a no-good budget, and you were quite right to roll it tonight'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government ought to go right back to scratch and start again. It might find it easier to start again with a better Treasurer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1993-94, I address an issue that sadly has received relatively little coverage in the media with respect to the budget, in spite of its obvious importance, and that is the issue of unemployment. In doing so, I will endeavour to avoid the dialogue of undergraduate harangue, although I cannot resist one very brief response to the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). His speech very neatly encapsulated the response of the opposition on this budget: lots of false outrage on specifics; no serious position on the macro position economically; and asking the government for a lower deficit to deliver the tax cuts that it promised and not to make any other tax increases. Sadly, those positions, all put together, do not add up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a cyclical basis this budget is definitely a good one with respect to unemployment. We now have a budget deficit of $16 billion which, by implication, the honourable member for Higgins would like to be smaller and therefore less stimulatory. We also have the ongoing One Nation stimulus which is still flowing through our economy. The most disappointing feature about the budget, in my view, is the fact that the structural unemployment question has largely been left aside. We have a very good ongoing countercyclical strategy with the budget stimulus which will further boost economic growth, but we also need to tackle the structural unemployment problem. We need to tackle that now, not to wait for the white paper process and the caucus committee process, of which I am very pleased to be a part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unfortunate feature of the counter-cyclical strategy is that the days when growth will solve unemployment problems are well and truly gone. It is correct to say that One Nation is providing a substantial public sector stimulus to economic activity in this country. It is also correct to say that the relatively large deficit that the Commonwealth is now running will further stimulate economic activity, particularly through the device of the tax cuts. But, unlike previous situations, we face numerous additional challenges in tackling unemployment&mdash;challenges which are not amenable to relatively simple solutions such as higher growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New growth in the Australian economy is tending to focus more and more in relatively capital intensive and knowledge intensive industries. Unlike past recessions, we are seeing substantial job losses in previously relatively immune areas such as large areas of the services sector. It has been estimated by Professor Bob Gregory that we need a sustained six per cent annual growth rate in order to return to full employment and that roughly 3 1/2 per cent growth will allow us only to more or less stand still. This is because we have a labour force growing at roughly 160,000 per annum together with a gradual increase over time in the participation rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting&mdash;I think this is a good way of putting the outrage of the honourable member for Higgins in some perspective&mdash;that the type of problem we face in this country is occurring in virtually every other OECD country. There is a major structural economic problem which we and most people in the Western world are having to address. Why is the situation different? Unfortunately, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) is not here to ask, `What about Asia?', but I will deal with that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions we have to address are: why is the situation different from the past when growth was a major solution to unemployment problems? Why is it happening across the Western world? The key answers are internationalisation of economic activity and particularly the shift of mass employment based manufacturing to the newly industrialising economies of Asia. Our ability to relocate production has expanded enormously. The ability to control production processes from afar through things such as the fax machine, communications technology and the like, global deregulation and dramatic reductions in the cost of transport and communications have made it a lot easier to relocate manufacturing elsewhere. That is precisely what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Added to that, we have the substantial flood of new technology, which is producing an ongoing revolution within the work force, particularly in the manufacturing area, but now starting to hit the services area and soon to hit the agricultural area through biotechnology. Phenomena such as micro-electronics, robotics and biotechnology are producing an ongoing wave of mass job destruction. They are also creating jobs&mdash;all new technology creates jobs as well as destroying them&mdash;but internationalisation and technological change are tending to destroy more jobs in an economy such as Australia's than they are creating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combined effect of these phenomena is negating the value of the easy options such as pumping up growth, import primage, which has been suggested, and blunter instruments of taxation. All of these approaches, which probably would have been much simpler in the past, are now causing us to face substantial negative consequences from macro-economic policy as well. Internationalisation is a global fact of life which Australia has to face up to and which this government is facing up to. In the long term net sense, internationalisation is not only a good thing for the Australian economy but also a good thing for the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a force which, in my view, will ultimately erode the corrosive power of nationalism and militarism which we still see as a dominant player in world affairs. Unfortunately, what internationalisation of our economy is doing at the same time is gradually destroying the long-established mechanism we have had in this country for redistributing national wealth that has been earned substantially by resource, agricultural and pastoral industries through exports across to a broad base of the population by the device of manufacturing and services associated with manufacturing. That type of economic structure is clearly changing dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also changing, and relevant to this debate, is the structure of work itself and the structure of the labour market. Across the Western world the returns to higher income earners provided in the labour market are increasing and the returns provided to lower skilled, lower income earners are reducing. In the United States between 1983 and 1993, the average wage for a low-skilled male employee has dropped by 20 per cent. A respected columnist from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Times</EMPHASIS>, Mr Edward Balls, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Statesman</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">and</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Society</EMPHASIS>, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No developed country has avoided the collapse in demand for unskilled male labour over the past two decades.</PARA>
<PARA>A recent visit I paid to the Ford factory in Broadmeadows brought home this point where the traditional old-style production line job is being replaced by a radically different type of production line job that involves a much higher skill, a much greater level of training and a much more direct involvement of employees in decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A radical change that also entails fewer workers is occurring in the most traditional areas of production in this country. Market pressures are downsizing in the private sector; micro-economic reform is downsizing in the public sector. We face even more job losses in the future through the ongoing process of tariff reduction, no more so than in the car industry. The federal government is also implicitly supporting retrenchments by state governments in many public sector areas such as in the education system and the health system, no more so than in my own state&mdash;and regrettably so, in my view&mdash;in the pursuit of a narrow concept of efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, middle income jobs are starting to disappear. In the last 15 years, according to Professor Gregory, most of the employment growth in this country has been at the extreme ends of the spectrum&mdash;in the high income jobs and in the low income jobs. This is leading to a new phenomenon about which I had a good discussion the other day with the National Skillshare Association&mdash;that is, the gradual emergence of a class of former middle managers who are now downgrading, so-called, into manual jobs, into much lower paid jobs, and in so doing displacing or competing with lower skilled workers who previously have held or competed for those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Large enterprises are shrinking and we are also seeing a substantial alteration in the structure of economic activity. There is more temporary work, more contracting out, and the development of small firms in networks and relationships with larger firms. An approach is now starting to unfold where there is a new category of person in the labour market. There is not yet really a title to describe that person, but he or she could be called a mixed income individual who fluctuates between occasional reliance on social security benefits, some income from part-time work or casual work and some income from self-employment through some form of business activity. The growth of this sort of activity is restricted by the existence of poverty traps which threaten people not only with loss of social security benefits but also with loss of fringe benefits and particularly with loss of eligibility for labour market programs. It is also threatened by the continually conservative attitude of our banks to providing loan funds to smaller businesses that do not have enormous amounts of collateral, bricks and mortar, on which to borrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The phenomenon is also to some extent restricted by devices that we have had to put in place to ensure proper superannuation and workers compensation coverage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also major change occurring in the area of training and education which is no better illustrated than by the comments I made before about the change at the Ford factory. We now face a critical structural problem that we have not really had to deal with before&mdash;that is, the threat of a very large number of people remaining unemployed for extended periods of time. We are now heading towards a figure of 400,000 long-term unemployed people. It is overdue both in the media and in politics that we start to move away from the obsessive focus on the raw unemployment figure each month and focus more on both the long-term unemployment figure and on the very long-term unemployment figure, because they tell us a bit more about what is actually going on in the economy and about the true seriousness of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1983 and 1990, 1.6 million new jobs were created in Australia. Seventy thousand of those new jobs went to long-term unemployed people, in effect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to training and labour market programs, the government clearly has got it very right. I applaud the increase of $120 million in the budget for labour market programs. However, there are many people out there now suffering from what I would call training saturation, who have been through four or five different courses, still cannot get jobs and are now in need of training or skill maintenance rather than yet another new training program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labour market programs also tend to be excessively complex. The analysis of outcomes is unduly arbitrary. The question of where people are after three months is a very simplistic way of looking at it. The eligibility criteria are often quite rigid. There is substantial room for reform and I have no doubt that the government will grapple with the need for change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to labour market deregulation, the experience in Britain in particular provides a good illustration of a country where there is now no regulation of the labour market, other than restrictions on trade unions, yet its unemployment problem remains roughly the same. Growth provides some of the solution but not all of the solution. We have a situation where the ordinary worker has no faith in private enterprise providing the solution because the ordinary worker has lived through the 1980s when increased profits were effectively squandered through speculation, building of high-rise office blocks and the like. Many higher income earners, it has to be conceded, lack faith in government to be able to rechannel additional taxes into employment creation. We have a bit of a political log jam in trying to deal with the employment issue, in trying to ensure that we can redirect the money flow through our economy in such a way that more jobs will be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where will the jobs come from? There is no simple, big bang initiative, no magic solution that can be put forward. We have to craft a package of solutions which focuses on the medium term but which is developed now&mdash;or at least the process of development should begin now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude with some options which I believe the government should be considering now, leading into the white paper process and not waiting for that process to deliver the goods. The tax mix clearly has to be altered in order to enable us to assist those who are losing out in the existing situation as a result of structural adjustment.

There is not a hint of apology or contrition in what the government is saying or doing. Labor does not have the guts to own up to what it has done. The reception has been so bad that the government is already backing away from some of the measures it proposed on budget night. The spectacle of Labor using the imagery of small children to justify its tax grab through the petrol pump is simply pathetic, and can serve only to heighten the new extremes, the cynicism towards the people from Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we got? We see a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who is stressed out; we see a Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) who is spaced out; we see the Australian jobless locked out; and, on top of that, we see the caucus frozen out. We got this from a Labor regime. Anyone who has the audacity to question the government's claims or its economic strategy, such as it is, has to cop personal abuse of the worst order from the Prime Minister and other Labor members opposite. Their aim is to bully and cajole people into acceptance of the government's deceptions and economic irresponsibility. No amount of political thuggery from the Australian Labor Party is going to save this budget from being condemned for the travesty that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget deficit estimated for 1993-94 amounts to some $16 billion, which is equivalent to 3.8 per cent of gross domestic product. When one adjusts for the impact of asset sales, Reserve Bank profits, dividends from government business enterprises and other like factors, the underlying deficit is more like $23 billion. That is a huge increase on the budget deficit outcome for 1992-93 of $14.5 billion, yet this budget is supposedly designed to put the Commonwealth's finances back on an even keel consistent with the government's stated objective of reducing the Commonwealth budget deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of the estimates in this budget, this target will entail a budget deficit of $5.8 billion in 1996-97. What we should be aiming for, of course, is a budget surplus by 1996-97 and not a budget deficit. The government recognised this as being a desirable goal in its One Nation economic statement of just a year or so ago. That document called on the government to produce a budget surplus within the same time frame as the government now anticipates producing a budget deficit of nearly $6 billion. It is interesting, however, that Labor's most recent budget deficit for 1996-97 is based on growth forecasts that are even more optimistic than the universally lampooned forecasts contained in the now infamous One Nation statement. So we have every reason to be worried about whether the government's new fiscal targets will be reached, dicey as they undoubtedly are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has imposed on this country a chronic budget imbalance of a magnitude that dwarfs the few budget surpluses of just a few years ago&mdash;a chronic budget imbalance which seemingly has no end in sight. Rather than a reduction of the budget deficit, what we have under Labor is an increase in the size of the budget deficit for the current financial year and an increase in the public sector's call on national savings. If the government's growth forecasts are not realised, which historically would be the usual outcome under this administration, the Commonwealth's finances are in even more serious trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget deficit entails a gross Commonwealth financing requirement of just under $22 billion for 1993-94. The ratio of the Commonwealth's debt outstanding to gross domestic product will be around 22 per cent at the end of 1993-94 on budget estimates&mdash;never mind real world assessments. The net public sector borrowing requirement will rise to 5.1 per cent of GDP in 1993-94, which is up from 4.8 per cent in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget means that the accumulated total of public sector deficits since 1991-92 will be over $70 billion by 1996-97&mdash;a figure that makes the surpluses of a few years ago look paltry by comparison. These public sector deficits will result in a massive increase in public debt interest payments. Public debt interest outlays will increase by 25.7 per cent in 1993-94, or 22.7 per cent in real terms. It is instructive to note that public sector debt interest outlays will amount to some 5.8 per cent of total Commonwealth outlays in 1993-94 compared with 4.8 per cent only last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are inevitably going in the wrong direction. The increase in the budget deficit, and in the public sector's call on national saving, is attributable to Labor's complete failure to tackle the difficult exercise of expenditure restraint that has occurred, despite the brazen tax grab in the wake of the last federal election. On the revenue side, the government is engaged in a massive exercise of giving with one hand while taking away with the other. The result is that total revenue collections this year will increase by 4.5 per cent on those same collections last year, a real increase of 1.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These revenue collections will amount to 23.5 per cent of gross domestic product and will rise to 24.3 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. If the government had to raise in tax revenue this year what it plans to spend this year, then the increase in the overall tax burden would have been even higher. But the Bankcard mentality lingers on. With this budget, Labor will preside over an increase in the overall tax burden despite its clear undertakings to the Australian people before the last election that no such increase would occur. No amount of obfuscation on the part of Labor can conceal this breach of faith with the Australian people. </PARA>

The government is acting as if it were in total ignorance of the economic evidence that has been mounting against these taxes over many years. One can only conclude that Labor has no regard for the impact of these taxes&mdash;it simply wants to grab hold of the associated revenue and hang the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales tax increases, the increases in fuel excise and other indirect taxes constitute an attack on the living standards of pretty well all Australians, but unequally. Such tax increases also add to the costs faced by business and attack the international competitiveness of our exports. These taxes have inflationary implications that have effectively put an end to the prospects for any further reductions in interest rates by greatly increasing the inflation rate that has been forecast for the year ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly true that the declining state of Australia's indirect tax base is something that needs to be addressed. We have acknowledged that. But what Labor has done has been to increase a range of pernicious indirect taxes that are highly damaging to our economic wellbeing, without actually doing anything about genuine and equitable reform of the indirect tax base. The government is not doing anything to restore the indirect tax base. It is not doing anything to introduce an efficient and equitable indirect tax system that would take some of the weight off personal income taxes. The government is shamelessly grabbing back that which it promised during the election campaign by way of personal income tax cuts and has been unable to deliver in full as promised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation by stealth is the government's preferred method of revenue raising. What is left of the promised personal income tax cuts is still heavily skewed away from low income earners, despite the fact that high income earners will now also miss out on those reductions in personal income tax that were promised to them before and during the election campaign. The Labor Party's own constituency, who may mistakenly put their trust in the true deceivers, will be severely short changed as a result of these measures. They are left with an income tax rebate of $2 a week&mdash;guilt money&mdash;which will have to go to pay for higher indirect taxes and an unchanged personal income tax burden. Only Labor would have the barefaced cheek to bundle all these tax increases together into one bill and try to get it through the Senate by calling it the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, an Orwellian title if ever there was one. These tax increases join the host of other promises and programs that the government has ditched since the election, most of them designed to dupe the Labor Party's own constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the expenditure side, we have seen with this budget a totally irresponsible failure to come to grips with the need for fiscal restraint. The government will be spending more money as if it were going out of fashion. The budget serves to confirm the fears of senior bureaucrats and many others that the whole expenditure review process has collapsed and needs to be radically reformed. Like some great amorphous mass, the Commonwealth government has adapted to the economic review process so that now only token cuts are made to government programs. The net result of the failure of the ERC process is that outlays will increase by 5.2 per cent in nominal terms or 2.5 per cent in real terms during 1993-94. Outlays will be equivalent to 27.3 per cent of gross domestic product in this year. Over the period 1989-90 to 1992-93, outlays have already increased by 16.7 per cent in real terms. The budget will add to that. The government simply has no idea how to cut its spending. </PARA>

Again, these benefits will be largely enjoyed by those who could easily afford to support the arts out of their own pockets. Instead, the cost of these programs will be spread across the entire community, particularly low income wage and salary earners who do so badly out of this budget and do not get much out of the arts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to get an idea of what could be achieved by a government serious about spending restraint, one need look no further than Des Moore's annual review of Commonwealth government expenditure for the Institute of Public Affairs. In the most recent version of that paper, Des Moore outlines a possible total reduction in outlays over two years of nearly $9 billion. That answers the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) who interjected earlier. Coupled with a more intensive program of privatisation, he shows how the deficit can be reduced by nearly $22 billion in three years. These reductions do not involve cutting the public sector as the stressed-out Prime Minister so colourfully suggests, but rather bring the Commonwealth budget sector under the same financial discipline that can be routinely found in the private sector, and which the Commonwealth has itself sought to impose on the States in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget shows that the government simply has no idea how to increase national savings, which its own FitzGerald report identifies as one of our most pressing economic needs. The FitzGerald report found that Australia's national savings are at their lowest levels this century, when one excludes from consideration the national emergencies of the Second World War and the Great Depression. Dr FitzGerald also made very clear who the main culprit in this decline was when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main contributor to our long term decline in national saving is a decline in public sector saving.</PARA>
<PARA>This major structural decline he traced back to the mid-1970s&mdash;the Whitlam years&mdash;but it is clear that this government has made a substantial contribution of its own to lower national savings in recent times. While Labor has been claiming that the deterioration in public sector saving has been cyclical in nature, Dr FitzGerald makes it clear that this decline has been anything but cyclical. He notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main cause of the fall in our saving performance is not cyclical factors (as saving is still low even after recovery) but underlying structural factors&mdash;particularly the structural decline in public sector saving.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr FitzGerald notes that reversing this structural decline in our national savings will require a major effort on the part of the public sector to restore public sector finances. No such effort is to be found in this budget, however, I am sorry to say. As part of his suggested national saving strategy, Dr FitzGerald recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At each level of government, the general government sector should seek to move to a position of persistent significant surpluses on current transactions&mdash;that is, to generate positive saving, so as to finance internally at least some of government's investment.</PARA>
<PARA>This would entail financing out of current revenues all recurrent expenditure and some capital expenditures as well. This would serve to return the Commonwealth to its natural position of the last 30 years, which has been to run an overall government budget surplus. On average, the Commonwealth general government sector ran a surplus equivalent to 1.7 per cent of GDP during the 1960s and early 1970s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his shallow victory speech last March to the true believers in subterfuge, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) thanked Australian women and is quoted as saying, `We won't let you down'. I report to honourable members tonight that the Prime Minister and the Labor movement have let women down. In fact, this government is actively and consciously ignoring the health needs of Australian women. Australian women are dying of an epidemic, yet this government believes in the minimalist approach to saving them. The government's commitment does not extend beyond its rhetoric.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Breast cancer kills six Australian women a day, yet the federal government is slow to react to increasing community pressure to extend the public health system and Medicare facilities to provide for a most basic and drastic need in the field of women's health. There has been no effort to make preventative screening for all women for breast cancer rebateable under Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the shallow assurances by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) and his spokespeople that the government would address the issue of funding and that the government had already publicly recognised the need for more funds to research and combat breast cancer, nothing has happened. Let me for a moment put it into a personal context. In the words of the Hancock Family Breast Cancer Foundation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Breast cancer more than any other disease strikes at the very fabric of the individual&mdash;the woman's sexuality, motherhood and self image, and affects the whole dynamic of her family. Like other malignancies it robs the community and the work force of valuable members . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The funding disparity between breast cancer research and other diseases is alarming. This is not a criticism of other funding projects, but an urgent call for some parity in funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The acquired immune deficiency syndrome&mdash;AIDS&mdash;attracts $62 million annually in research assistance, with a substantially lower mortality rate than breast cancer. Breast cancer kills six Australian women a day. In the last 10 years AIDS has taken toll of a total of 2,500 lives. In my own state of Western Australia, over 700 women are diagnosed with cancer every year, with the mortality rate as high as one-third of these women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What level of Commonwealth support does this epidemic attract? In 1992-93, $17.5 million was spent on the national program for the early detection of breast cancer. In this financial year the Commonwealth will spend approximately $29.8 million. Compared with the United States of America, this is abysmal. In the USA, breast cancer research attracts $US400 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To show more clearly the paradox of the poor way in which this government treats women's health issues, here is an example. A young woman, perhaps one of our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporters, could go to the doctor tomorrow to get a cancer check-up as she is concerned about her own health. If she has a Pap smear to test for cervical cancer, the cost is chargeable to Medicare. At the same time, she may take the preventative measure of having her breasts checked for potential cancers. The cost is not covered by Medicare, yet the chance of getting cervical cancer is one in 70 compared to the one in 16 chance of having breast cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An epidemic in the area of women's health&mdash;a one in 16 chance of having breast cancer and a mortality rate of six Australian women every day&mdash;and the government's record is one of ignorance and non-action in regard to research. In Western Australia the screening program is reaching only 15 per cent of the targeted over 45 age group. The targeted population in Western Australia was identified as 190,000 women. To December 1992, only 27,000 women had been screened since the breast cancer screening initiative was announced in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to use this opportunity to echo the demands and concerns of Australian women everywhere. In doing so, I reinforce the community calls for greater Commonwealth public health moneys to be spent on breast cancer research and for the breast cancer screening to be rebateable under our Medicare system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, as the minister considers these requests, I remind the government of an old saying which it would do well to remember: `Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not rise to speak this evening to respond to the honourable member for Cowan, but I could not resist the provocation. Yesterday morning I had the opportunity&mdash;and very pleasant it was, too&mdash;to attend the grand final of the fifth division of the Brisbane Women's Soccer Association, which was held in Brisbane. As you know, Mr Speaker, I am a keen follower of many sports and in the last 12 months or so I have had the pleasure of going to a number of women's soccer games. Yesterday was particularly pleasant because that fifth division grand final was won by a team which included my daughter, as the goalkeeper, and my wife.

It is also a great tribute that a team of newcomers was turned into a team of champions, which is in fact what they ended up as yesterday morning&mdash;they won that grand final.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that became clear to me during the season&mdash;and it is something which I have spoken about previously in the parliament&mdash;is the way in which women's sport is often neglected by not just the media but also the authorities. It is a sad fact that the fields that the women played on most often were substandard fields. The home ground for Brisbane women's soccer is a field that would not be used by any senior male team, and it was only rarely that the women got to play on a field that would be regarded as acceptable to the senior men's team.

Currently less than 10 per cent of all international aid for development is directly devoted to meeting basic human needs such as adequate food, safe drinking water, primary health care, family planning and basic education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the United Nations development program only about two per cent of Australian aid goes to these basic development priority areas. UNICEF and the UN development program both strongly recommend that at least 20 per cent of governments' aid spending should be allocated to meeting human priority needs. A restructuring of national aid budgets would therefore help considerably in finding the funds needed to meet the goal. Immunisation of 80 per cent of the world's children and the widespread availability of oral rehydration therapy are examples of the changes quietly being made and which are saving the lives of four million children a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The goal of 80 per cent immunisation was little more than a promise on paper at the beginning of the 1980s. The promise was made a reality as a result of widespread support from the public, the media, politicians and the consistent support of the international community. Around the world, 100 million children are now being vaccinated on several occasions in the first year of life. This shows the extraordinary capacity available to put pure life saving and life enhancing technologies at the disposal of the world's one billion poorest people. It also shows that a high level of political commitment makes progress possible even under very difficult circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But where does Australia stand amongst the 138 other signatories to the world declaration? Since September 1990 we have been navel gazing. One of the promises of the declaration was that a national program of action would be completed by the end of 1991. Nearly two years later there is still no adopted plan of action for Australia. The plan was off for years with the Prime Minister's department. It appears that only the eyes of the government bureaucrats have been fit to gaze upon it in all that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compared with the 54 other countries which have published detailed national plans of action, Australia is far behind. When will the currently responsible minister, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe), prise the national plan of action from the bureaucracy? When will the government meet the promise and the goals to which Australia committed itself back in 1991? Certainly Australia must do it well before the year 2000 when, according to the terms of the world summit, goals are supposed to be met. Time is running out for Australia to meet its obligation to the world's children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, with your indulgence I want to read to the House an essay that was written by a Tara McGillivray of 91 The Esplanade, Henley Beach South, Adelaide, who attends Fulham North Primary School. Tara wrote this essay in response to an essay competition I held last year, and it is such a good essay, and has such a good spirit about it, that I would like to read it to the House. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proud to be Australian</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am proud to be an Australian because the average wage for Australians is probably $10.00 an hour or more than in many other countries. Just the other day I heard on television that an overseas shoe company paid their employees fifty cents an hour, that's approximately six dollars for a twelve hour day. The conditions they work in are much worse than ours as well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We all help each other in an emergency. Volunteers help people whose homes have been destroyed by floods, fires, cyclones or earthquakes. Other people help by donating money, food and clothing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We don't usually have to worry about an operation if we need one. Our country has good doctors, surgeons, medication and hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The schooling in Australia is very good compared with other countries in the world like Kenya or Yugoslavia. Some schools in other countries don't even have pens or paper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our water is clean compared to other countries and people are complaining about the quality when they could be drinking mud which would give them diseases. Everybody should be able to see that we are much better off than many other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the most important thing is from the age of eighteen you can vote for your choice of leader for the country. Some citizens of other countries don't have the freedom to do this. Aren't you glad to be an Australian?</PARA>
<PARA>The young girl who wrote that does not give her age, but I believe she was 11 years old. I think that was a very nice essay, and it is great that our kids are proud to be Australian. </PARA>

Further to the comments of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), I might add that one of the pleasures of this job is visiting schools, at both the primary and secondary level, to talk to the students about parliamentary process and related citizenship activities. I think we have all found that the level of their interest and, in many cases, their knowledge is a great tribute to them and their teachers. It is a source of some comfort when we consider that in the not too distant future they will be adults casting a vote. The level of education in these matters has improved dramatically&mdash;I guess more dramatically in a state like Queensland which, for many years, was shackled by a system which deliberately precluded the introduction of social education materials such as MACOS, High Court explanatory booklets and a whole range of other fairly basic educational material which, at the time, was freely available everywhere else.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think the current budget provides for a reduction in the order of $3 billion in outlays.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr Beddall</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Austel, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Telecom and Optus have entered into Heads of Agreements on the implementation of preselection. While Austel has, by mediating and arbitrating between the parties, facilitated Telecom and Optus in reaching agreement, Austel is not a party to the Heads of Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Heads of Agreements do not refer to geographic areas covered by area codes. The grouping of customers for the purposes of access to the second carrier's network is expressed in terms of Inter Carrier Charging Areas (ICCAs). ICCAs are defined to coincide with current network charging boundaries, not numbering boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are currently 54 area codes (ie, numbering areas) within Australia, and 204 ICCAs. In the cases of major capital cities and a few other particular instances the ICCAs correspond to numbering areas, but for the majority of regional Australia they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial availability of the second carrier in an ICCA (by means of Dial "1") is to be followed within nine months by commencement of the ballot for preselection in that ICCA, provided at least 80 per cent of the customers in that ICCA have had modern exchange capability for not less than five months, (ie they can access Optus by means of Dial "1"). After balloting in an ICCA, preselection will be implemented promptly and Dial "1" will be withdrawn shortly thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 052 area code contains two ICCAs (Geelong and Colac). These are treated separately with respect to percentage capability for equal access and timing of introduction of Dial "1". The Geelong ICCA has an installed local exchange capacity for customer connections of 107,542 lines. The total for the Colac ICCA is 11,726 lines. Not all of this capacity is in use at any given time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 15 April 1993, 83 per cent of the local exchange capacity within the Geelong ICCA had the capability to provide access to the second carrier via the Dial "1". Optus was offering Dial "1" service in Geelong as at 15 April 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, on 15 April 1993, 21 per cent of the local exchange capacity within the Colac ICCA had the technological capability to participate in Dial "1" access. In view of this low proportion Optus had not chosen to negotiate with Telecom the implementation of Dial "1" capability in the Colac ICCA at that stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) (a) The Newcastle (049) area contains a single ICCA. On 15 April 1993 the total local exchange capacity for customer connections within that ICCA was 224,148, of which 42 per cent had access to the second carrier via the Dial "1" method. Optus was offering Dial 1 service in Newcastle as at 15 April 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The Wollongong (042) area also contains a single ICCA. On 15 April 1993 the total exchange capacity for customer connections within that ICCA was 108,604, of which 25 per cent had access to the second carrier via the Dial "1" method. Optus was offering Dial 1 service in Wollongong as at 15 April 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Preselection and the associated customer choice process are elements of the equal access and interconnection regime, which having regard to section 137 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 are, in the first instance, the subject of negotiation and agreement between the carriers. Therefore, the timing of ballots in all areas is a matter for agreement between the carriers. Austel would not decide the timing of ballots unless the carriers cannot agree and the matter is submitted to Austel for arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision on whether ballots in Geelong, Wollongong and Newcastle should be synchronised with those for Melbourne and Sydney respectively is a matter for the carriers to agree on. A starting date must accord with the carriers' agreed time frame for the commencement of the ballot after Optus' services begin in an area. The Canberra ballot began on 15 July, the Sydney ballot began on 3 August. The ballot is scheduled to begin in Melbourne on 1 September. Optus has announced that the Geelong and Mornington ballots will begin on 4 October. Ballot dates for Newcastle, Wollongong and other areas have yet to be announced. This is a matter to be settled by Telecom and Optus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom and Optus have agreed that Optus has the right to trigger the ballot in each area, within specified parameters but also on the basis of its own commercial and strategic judgement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speed in holding ballots relates to two issues&mdash;the modernisation of customer exchange lines so that pre selection is technically operational, and how quickly the ballot is held after a customer gains access to Optus through Dial 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suitability of an ICCA for introduction of preselection is dependent on the percentage of modernised customer lines in exchanges in that area. In August 1991 Telecom was directed by the then Minister for Transport and Communications to undertake a program of modernisation which would ensure that all customers would be subject to preselection by 1997. This modernisation program is resource-intensive, which limits the speed of its implementation. Thus, the timing of preselection availability and the ballot in each ICCA is predicated to a large degree by this modernisation process. It is Austel's role to oversee the introduction of all aspects of equal access, including exchange modernisation and preselection, within the time-frame specified in the Minister's direction. The carriers' plans for progression of preselection are monitored by Austel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timing for introduction of Dial "1" access in any ICCA is negotiated between the carriers, but is largely dependent on the same exchange modernisation process which must precede preselection. The carriers have mutually agreed to an arrangement whereby the ballot will be triggered in any ICCA within a five to nine month time window after the date of introduction of Dial "1" access in that ICCA. This provision was agreed to ensure that consumers will have an adequate opportunity to try the second carrier's services before being asked to participate in the ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The carriers are negotiating the timing and sequence of the introduction of preselection in accordance with section 137 of the Telecommunications Act 1991. This section of the Act also provides for arbitration by Austel where agreement is not reached. Austel has not been requested to arbitrate on issues relating to the timing or sequence of preselection. However, in its role as a mediator, Austel has sought to expedite the carriers' agreement on the implementation of the ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) &amp; (7) It is not possible at this stage for Austel to separately estimate the costs of the balloting process for large cities versus smaller centres. The carriers have contracted the successful candidate organisation for the Ballot Administration task, and there is a degree of confidentiality relating to detailed costing within that contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of public knowledge that the gross cost of the task has been quoted at $30m nationally. This figure would suggest a national average cost of about $4 per customer line for the ballot and related costs such as printing, postage, data management and information transfer to customers and carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) (a) &amp; (b) Austel's full time staffing equivalent level at 1 January 1993, and also at 1 April 1993, was 140. Of these, approximately 50 were involved in licensing and technical standards activities, approximately 50 were involved in consumer affairs, competition policy and industry analysis activities, and approximately 40 were involved in corporate and support roles. The staff numbers above include 10 persons outposted to offices in capital cities other than Melbourne.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Austel is required to administer the Price Cap arrangements under the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Act 1991. Under this Act the dominant carrier (Telecom) must, in real terms, reduce its prices for the main communications services in Australia by the level specified by the Government. The price cap formula applies to charges for Telecom's connections, business and residential rentals, local, long distance and international call and mobile telephone charges. It also includes domestic and international leased line service charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed variations to charges for connection of eligible services to the public switched telephone network, public payphone calls and calls for directory assistance must also be notified to the Minister who may seek Austel's advice as to whether the variations should be disallowed in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, under the Telecommunications Act 1991 all licensed carriers are obliged to supply Austel with details of their tariffs for basic carriage services. Austel may disallow tariffs which do not comply with the requirements of section 190 of that Act. These relate to such elements as the form in which the nature and detail of the charges are notified, how they have varied and the terms and conditions under which the relevant service is supplied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austel is also required under section 399 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 to report to the Minister on carrier performance.

These real price reductions achieved by Telecom are in line with the Government's expectations when formulating the price cap. For international services, prices for services subject to the cap have fallen some 25 per cent in real terms over the same period on a cumulative basis. Telecom has delivered price reductions of about twice the level required by the price cap.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The ABC declined to purchase the documentary by John Pilger, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Return to Year Zero</EMPHASIS>. The decision was made by the Network Programmer, in consultation with senior management from the News and Current Affairs and Documentaries areas. The program was subsequently shown by the SBS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I am advised that the documentary contains this line of argument, which is obviously a view totally rejected by the Australian Government. I am further advised that this view was rejected by a panel of discussants following the SBS showing of the film.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The ABC has advised that the Head of Television Documentaries was absent due to illness at the time the decision not to screen the documentary was made. However, another senior member of the Department, the National Commissioning Editor for Independent Documentaries was one of the group which made the final decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The ABC has advised that it declined to purchase the Pilger documentary because it duplicated Cambodian coverage already planned by its own News and Current Affairs Division, and other program purchases. For instance, on 1 May the ABC current affairs series, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Foreign Correspondent</EMPHASIS> screened an extensive piece by the British journalist and author William Shawcross, also widely known for his Cambodian work. As was the case with the Pilger documentary, Shawcross raised concerns over the continuing influence of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodian affairs, as well as their status under the United Nations Peace Plan. The role taken by the Australian Government, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Cambodia in recent times, had no bearing on the ABC's actions in this matter. The ABC has indicated it will continue to provide a comprehensive coverage of the Cambodia situation, in accordance with its charter to reflect a range of views on this and other issues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Act (No 3) 1992 amended the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 to, inter alia, permit corporate sponsorship on the ATVI service (now known as Australia Television).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The ABC has advised that revenue received in respect of Australia Television from July 1992 to 31 May 1993 (the latest available figures) from all external sources, excluding the Government start up grant of $5.4 million, is $0.228 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The ABC advises that costs for Australia Television over the same period total $2.531 million. The ABC's business plan for Australia Television relies upon funds from a number of sources including income from sponsorships and an initial grant of $5.4m from the Government. The ABC undertook the service on the basis that it would be self-funding after the initial Government grant. The ABC is confident the business plan will be achieved. Marketing agents are now being  appointed both for Australia and the region. Australia Television is also seeking sponsorships directly. The ABC estimates projected revenue from advertising and sponsorship on Australia Television at $2.9 million in 1993-94 and $5.2 million in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) See (3). As part of the conditions attached to the initial $5.4m grant, the Government required that Australia Television be operated through a subsidiary company so that any assistance provided by the ABC would be transparent. The ABC advises that assistance provided to Australia Television will be reflected in the Australia Television accounts, and has not involved a redirection of funds from the ABC's free-to-air services.</PARA>
