<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity at the start of this historic Saturday sitting of the House to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns), for the guidance of members, whether he can give any indication as to not just when the House might get up, difficult as that might be, but more particularly when it is likely that the government will make the decision to give up on waiting for the Senate. I think this is a legitimate request. When is the government likely to take the decision that it can no longer keep the House waiting?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It now looks as though the Senate will sit until Monday or Tuesday. In fact, the Senate committee has just reached clause 13, having bypassed clause 9. The Mabo legislation is huge. The government has found 74 mistakes in the bill; there are 74 amendments. There may be more. That is another good reason to hold it over to 31 January or 1 February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the start of this historic sitting, when honourable members on both sides of the House have critical plans and there are very difficult logistics in honourable members getting back to their electorates and families, can the government indicate&mdash;it cannot predict exactly what might happen&mdash;when it is likely to be in a position to assess the progress in the Senate so that we can know when this House might get up this day? If it is that this House must come back this year, is the government thinking of the Tuesday or Wednesday of this forthcoming week or of leaving it until the new year? Any guidance on that matter I am sure would be of value to all honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA>Amendment No. 1 of the Senate deleted the new schools policy related clauses Nos 3 to 13. These put into legislation some matters associated with the proper administration of the new schools policy. I point out to the committee that some good things were lost in the process. There is now no capacity for discretion on late applications for schools wishing to amalgamate or rationalise their operations. Schools which submit late will now have to wait a full 12 months and then resubmit. </PARA>

Instead, they will have to introduce years 7 to 10 in one go with a minimum of 100 students. The Senate's amendment will impose substantial and possibly impossible burdens on many schools. Nevertheless, the government at this stage will accept the Senate's wishes on this matter, but I want the opposition to be aware that we are considering reintroducing these amendments next year. In my judgment, it is impossible to get agreement at this stage of the year to what we had proposed, but I assure the opposition that, in the meantime, we will be referring complaints from the non-government sector to those responsible for this very unwise amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated in the second reading debate when the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill was in the chamber previously, the attitude of the coalition towards the new schools policy is such that we believe that this is an unnecessary and unwelcome burden on schools generally in Australia that wish to commence operation. It places certain limitations on the ability of new schools to start up because those limitations in the legislation provide that a certain period of notice must be given prior to new schools coming into operation. The reality of the practice of this policy is that it places limitations on the ability of new schools to start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the landscape of Australia and at where new schools come into operation, one sees that it tends to be in outer urban areas and in parts of regional Australia which are fast developing. Parents, for whatever reason, decide that there is a need in their area for a school which meets their requirements in terms of education and, therefore, they wish to start a school. In our view, there ought to be as few restrictions as possible upon those parents in those circumstances to be able to commence a school and bring it into operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the new schools policy, even as it stands, is to place clear restrictions on the commencement of schools. The effect of the clauses which were part of this bill&mdash;the subject of the debate in the Senate of which the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) has spoken&mdash;was to further restrict the ability of schools to commence their operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has made some remarks about some of the effects of these clauses being defeated and has said that the government may reintroduce some legislation to this effect. If the effect of that legislation, when it is reintroduced, is to overcome the difficulties to which the minister refers, then no doubt he will get the support of the coalition both in this place and the other place. In relation to the new schools policy, we are clearly saying that we do not believe that there ought to be overly burdensome and onerous restrictions on the ability of parents in this country to commence a new school. That is our fundamental objection to this policy. It is an objection which we will sustain in debates of this nature. </PARA>

Will she write to the minister and say, `Dear Minister, I am writing on behalf of some of my constituents who wish to start a new school. Isn't this legislation a burden that makes it difficult to start a school?' The minister will send back a nice reply, as he does to such letters in these circumstances when those on the other side write to ministers, explaining that it is for administrative ease of the department that we have this policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a clear example of the effect of a policy like this, which says to these parents that they might want to start a new school, they might want to provide an education which meets their requirements for their children's future, but we, as the government, say that they will have to wait for two to three years before they can even contemplate getting a new school started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a fundamental objection to the whole tenor of the new schools policy. That is why we objected to these particular clauses: they further restricted the ability of parents and, therefore, of students to be able to attend a new school. I say to the honourable member for Forde that it is precisely in the sorts of areas that she represents that these schools are starting up all over Australia. If she is going to represent her constituents, she might say to the minister, `Why do we need to further restrict this sort of policy?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take on board what the minister says. I accept that there may be some difficulties, but it is surely not beyond the wit of his department and parliamentary counsel to come up with a set of amendments which will deal with those particular problems that he foreshadows may arise but, at the same time, will not further restrict the ability of parents in this country who wish to start new schools. After all, this is the government which tells us about the clever country. This is the government which says to us that we need to improve the education and training system in this country. This is the government which says that if we are going to be internationally competitive in Australia, then we have to have a world class education system. Surely being internationally competitive would involve some element of competition in relation to schools themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says to us day after day, week after week and year after year that we have to be internationally competitive. Yet, when we deal with a measure that brings a little more competition back into the education and training system itself, what does the government want to do? It wants to further restrict the education system in the manner in which these amendments propose to do. So here is a challenge to the government, if it is true to its word about our being a clever country and internationally competitive: let us make the education and training system in this country as competitive as we can. That, in turn, will help to make this country an internationally competitive country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, what parents want is an assurance that their children will be educated as well as they can be so, when they leave their system of education, they will have the best opportunity they can to get jobs and therefore be able to lead lives which are of meaning; lives which will give them a sense of identity as a result of what they do and what they want to contribute to the communities and the nation in which they live. If we are realistic&mdash;if we are honest about that objective, which I believe everybody in this place and everybody in Australia is&mdash;then we ought to be looking at policies which will bring about that end rather than policies like this one that simply restrict the ability to provide that level of competition and diversity in education in Australia. That is why we fundamentally object to these particular provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not wish to stand in the way of schools which are in the position, for example, to be able to put in a late application. I am sure that, if the minister wishes to, he can find some simple way in the legislation to deal with late applications. As I said, it ought not be beyond the wit of the parliamentary counsel or those in his office to overcome that particular minor problem that he says has arisen. For those reasons, I have set out our attitude towards this area in total. These particular amendments do pertain to the way in which we treat the ability of parents in this country to commence new schools. </PARA>

<PARA>The effect of Senate amendments Nos 2 to 18 will be to severely restrict the ability of the Commonwealth, the states, non-government systems and local communities to target those students who, in one way or another, are disadvantaged in our education systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments which affect the broadbanding of the country areas and disadvantaged schools program&mdash;clause 24 of the bill&mdash;effectively undo the capacity for local decision making to target those funds to children most in need. The real importance of the broadbanding, which this amendment undoes, is that it delivers the most progressive education agreements the Commonwealth has ever had with the states and territories. If the Senate amendments stand, all of this will be lost. There will be another year of no accountability for Commonwealth funds spent, there will be no commitments and there will be more floodlights on swimming pools. Even more importantly, there will be yet another year of ineffective targeting of funds; another year of not knowing how this money is spent and whether it is doing any good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened the other evening to the debate on these amendments in the Senate. I listened, in particular, to Senator Teague, who led for the opposition. He had essentially three complaints about the bill. He was concerned that the bill required from the states some detailed reporting on the expenditure of funds and, more importantly, on the outcomes that will be achieved for disadvantaged students. I say in response&mdash;because I imagine my friend the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) will raise these points when he makes his remarks&mdash;that I do not believe it is unreasonable for the government to expect some detailed reporting on outcomes when some $280 million of taxpayers' money is involved this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Forde is right. I do not believe it is unreasonable for the government to require reporting of outcomes in the interests of the various target groups. I venture to suggest that the same Senator Teague, in league with other opposition senators, behaves in quite a different way when he is working on Senate estimates committees, examining officials and tracking down every last dollar of government expenditure in other areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major complaint of Senator Teague about the bill was that the agreements require the states to report not only on the expenditure of Commonwealth funds and outcomes but also on their own contributions from state funds to targeted programs. In response, let me say that I believe the public and the interest groups have a right to know. I believe that those who represent the interests of the children in the target groups have a right to know not only how much the Commonwealth is putting in but also how much the states themselves are prepared to commit to equity programs in the interests of disadvantaged children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do know, from an examination of some state budgets for particular programs, that very little is spent on particular target groups and very little is spent above what the Commonwealth gives the states in the first place. We believe that the states should be made publicly accountable on this matter, and we believe that those states which perform well should also be acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague's third major complaint could be summarised in the words, `If it isn't broken, don't fix it'. He suggested that the country areas program, in particular, is a good program and is working well. I agree that in many respects it is a good program, but the government believes it can work better. I am not convinced, for example, that the educational futures and the life chances of disadvantaged kids in the bush are necessarily advantaged or require, as a priority, trips to New Zealand to see sheep, the floodlighting of polo grounds and the floodlighting of swimming pools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be possible to develop a sharper focus for the use of these funds that just might improve the educational futures and life chances of disadvantaged kids. But the significant thing about the speech made by Senator Teague was not what he said but what he did not say. It is a bit like the Sherlock Holmes case when Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had Holmes talking about a case with Doctor Watson. Holmes said, `Doctor Watson, the significant thing was that the dog did not bark'. In the Senate the other night Senator Teague did not bark. The one thing he did not say&mdash;and the one thing that is never mentioned in opposition speeches on broadbanding&mdash;is that their conservative colleagues in the States want broadbanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservative governments in Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and the Northern Territory&mdash;and I assume, the new coalition government in South Australia&mdash;have pressed the opposition in this place to support broadbanding. The reason is that the states believe they can apply funds more effectively if they are given the flexibility that broadbanding offers. It may well be that the agreements with the states, under the national equity programs for schools, will fail because of the Senate opposition amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that some states are waiting to see what happens with these amendments today before they proceed with a decision on whether to sign. That has potentially tragic consequences because the NEPs agreements are the flagship of a new era of developing cooperation between the Commonwealth Labor government and the majority of coalition governments in the states and territories on a whole range of educational matters. We have moved a long way from the conflict at the education ministers meeting in Perth in July to a very cooperative meeting in Hobart this month. These agreements represent the flagship of a whole range of matters on which there is an indication that we can cooperate to the benefit of Australian kids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this is at risk if the opposition amendments stand. The opposition has been remarkably inconsistent in its approach to these matters. When they are dealing with the country areas program, their position is that we cannot trust the states and we have to run things from Canberra. On the same evening in the Senate, when they were discussing the vocational education and training amendment bill they were urging us not to place requirements on states for expenditure. So in the same evening, the same opposition senators were saying on the one hand that we should trust the states and give them flexibility but, on the other hand, when they turned to the country areas program they said we cannot trust the states and hence they have inserted these amendments into the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is symptomatic of the opposition in the 1990s. They do not worry about a bit of inconsistency; they forget their own state colleagues who are behaving responsibility on this matter. This is an opposition that will oppose; and that is all it will do. It will oppose and make no further contribution at all. The children of Australia deserve better. In particular, children of rural and remote Australia deserve better. I urge the opposition to rethink its position on broadbanding. If we are ever to have a clever country, as the opposition spokesman says, it would help a lot if we had a clever opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments, amendments 2 to 18, are concerned with giving independent schools responsibility for equity programs. We had proposed to allow non-government schools the capacity to make these determinations. The effect of the Senate amendment is that the minister will determine the individual grants for equity programs, rather than everyone working together cooperatively to achieve joint equity objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is astounded that some parts of the independent sector are asking for close ministerial involvement in this area of their operations. It is much more common for independent schools politely to tell us to go away and let them get on with their work. For this reason, we oppose the amendments to clauses 20, 23, 24, 30, 33 and 34 as adopted by the Senate. We propose that the House reverse the opposition's amendments by deleting them from the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if some independent schools in cooperation with the opposition really want my intervention in their equity programs, I will accept the invitation, however reluctantly. But I will find it extremely difficult to manage this process equitably and fairly. The only real way will be that equity grants for all independent schools will have to be based on the recommendations of a national independent equity authority which I will need to establish to advise me on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the committee will see that this course of action is undesirable and cumbersome; and it certainly would not be welcomed by the bulk of schools in the independent sector.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address most of my remarks to the funding for country areas programs and the ability that was proposed in this legislation to transfer some of the pool of funding for disadvantaged schools to country areas or, more importantly, to transfer some of the pool of the country areas program funding to disadvantaged schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position which the coalition has taken on this matter is that the country areas program funding is an important funding of educational services and that the integrity of that pool of funds remain and not be subject to the possibility of being transferred to other areas. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) talks about wanting to help children. We are talking about a program which, on every review, has been said to be highly successful. A review of it just three years ago led to increased funding by the Commonwealth to the country areas program. It is a review which in every way has met its objectives in terms of providing equity programs to children in probably the most disadvantaged areas of Australia in terms of their education; that is, children in regional and rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schools have been encouraged to work cooperatively and come up with a program which uses what obviously are scarce resources in the best way possible to advantage children in these areas of regional and rural Australia. Why we object to these particular clauses is that the practical and realistic effect of them is that over time there will be a diminution in funds to country areas programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that disadvantaged schools tend to be more in urban and outer urban areas&mdash;which are growing. There is a natural propensity to direct funds, if there is no limitation, to those areas of the country rather than to rural and regional Australia. At the end of the day, rural and regional Australia will miss out and kids in country areas, who are already the least advantaged in terms of their educational opportunities, will find that they will miss out on these programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has thrown up a number of arguments on why we should not do this. The first thing I want to say about what we are proposing is that we are simply preserving the status quo, the integrity of the pool of funding which goes to the country areas program; and saying that that pool of funding should remain simply for the purpose of providing equity in educational opportunities for students in primary and secondary schools in rural and regional Australia. It is the government which is trying to make amendments which will throw into doubt the integrity of that pool of funds. We are saying that the integrity of that pool for the country areas program ought to be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great argument that the minister raises here and which was also raised in the Senate is that if these clauses which allow the transfer of funds from one pool to another are omitted there will be no accountability. That is patent nonsense. Proposed new subsection 72A(3) of clause 24 of the bill says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister must not authorise a payment to a State for the program year unless the State has made an agreement with the Commonwealth for that year, that is an agreement of a kind determined by the Minister setting out conditions on which financial assistance is granted to the State under this section.</PARA>
<PARA>That proposed new subsection, which is not proposed to be omitted from the bill, clearly determines that there will be an agreement and there will be accountability for these funds. To put this argument that there will be no accountability for these funds is simply flying in the face of the agreement which the bill talks about and which we are not proposing to omit. We have a straw man put up by the minister and the government who say that somehow accountability will be removed if we vote against being able to transfer funds from the country areas program to the disadvantaged schools program. On the face of the bill itself that is simply not the case, and if the minister can say otherwise I invite him to do so. That is the first argument raised in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I hear that the minister has now been saying to other parties in the Senate that the whole funding program will be in doubt if this measure does not go through. This does not affect the funding program at all. All we are saying is that those funds which the minister says ought to be allocated primarily to country areas ought to stay in the country areas rather than being syphoned off here or there. To say that this whole program is being placed in jeopardy, that the equity program will not go ahead or that students in country areas will be disadvantaged because these clauses are omitted from the bill is simply patent nonsense and nothing else. It is simply bluster on the part of the government to try to have its way in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and Senator Bell have raised another matter. Senator Bell is the Australian Democrat spokesman on education. Senator Bell has some difficulty justifying his position on this matter. Unlike the minister, he has not been consistent. When this matter went to the Senate it was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. A dissenting report emanated from the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, and the dissenting senators made a recommendation which said:</PARA>

The Democrat spokesman on education, Senator Bell, in the dissenting report of the Senate committee said that we should omit these proposed new subsections. It is clearly on the record; it is not simply the lip service we get from the Democrats when they say that they will vote one way and then we find they have voted the other way. In this case, they have put it in writing through their spokesman. But what happened when the matter went back to the Senate? Senator Bell changed his mind. On what basis did Senator Bell try to rationalise the Democrats' backflip in the Senate? He said that he changed his mind because there are agreements with the states in relation to this matter which will protect country area funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an interesting argument from Senator Bell. First of all, he is wrong about agreements with the states. The minister has conceded in debate this morning that the states have not signed these agreements. This includes Queensland&mdash;a Labor state. In a press release of about June or July this year the minister went on the record as saying that he would preserve the integrity of the country areas program. Why has the Minister for Education in Queensland not signed the agreement&mdash;that is a good question&mdash;let alone the other state ministers? Here is a Labor minister who has not signed the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of Senator Bell's proposition is that it begs the question. He referred to an agreement with the Queensland Catholic Education Commission. All that agreement does is require accountability in the use of the funds. This gives the lie to the minister's proposition about accountability anyway, because in the agreement that Senator Bell was able to produce in the Senate there is a series of provisions which require accountability for the use of the funds. If that is the case, it is clearly wrong for the minister to come in here and say that there will be no accountability if we omit this proposed new subsection. So Senator Bell is wrong on that score. In any event, if these amendments were reversed, the agreement would not do anything in terms of accountability because all the agreement does is allow for accountability of the funds; it does not pertain to whether or not we can shift from one pool to another. </PARA>

When the Whitlam government introduced the disadvantaged schools program it also instituted a review of the program through the Schools Commission. As the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) correctly pointed out, it was the case in 1975 and remains the case today that the disadvantaged schools program did not pick up on the particular form of disadvantage suffered by rural school children. Hence the recommendation for a separate and specific program for rural disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government of the time did not introduce the country areas program because, then as now, it had no particular concern for country people. It was a coalition government that brought in that program on the recommendation of an inquiry established by the previous Labor government. That illustrates that the Labor government has no concern for rural people, even though, as the honourable member for Menzies and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) have both pointed out, the degree of disadvantage for country school children is greater now than it was in 1975. Under Labor, the country areas program has not increased very much. In fact, it was not even keeping pace with other federally funded disadvantage programs until a review indicated its value and recommended an increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 40 schools in my electorate participate in the country areas program and, as the Senate committee inquiry recently showed, it is a very cost beneficial and efficient program. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), who is at the table, said that by our opposition to his proposal to broad band we are saying that we do not trust the states. Of course we do not trust the states; the minister does not either. If this federal government trusted the states there would be no national equity program and no disadvantaged schools program because everything would be completely broad banded in the total education budget. So what a farce of an argument he has put forward. All he is doing is saying, `Let us broad band it where it suits us to see that more money can be allocated to schools in the cities, but still do not trust the states to make sure that there are these specific elements that have to go to these programs'. By our support of these programs we indicate, perhaps whether we would like to or not, that we believe they should remain there because we do not believe the states would provide that money themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly do not trust the Victorian government because, when we checked ahead of the Senate committee and ahead of our position as to what we do with this matter, the information given to me by the Victorian government was that it would not adhere to all of that allocation to rural schools. I support the Victorian government in general terms, but as far as this is concerned we have a specific allocation for rural schools in Victoria through this program and that amount should be adhered to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the minister and this government, they do not honour this program anyway because the minister's department&mdash;presumably with the minister's authority&mdash;has already diverted, as I am told by country education project people in Victoria, somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 this calendar year from the country areas program to the gender equity program. So the government has already reduced what was available through that specific program. I have been advised that for 1994, if this program continues, the government will divert $750,000. I would be interested to hear whether my information is correct or not. Any diversion would indicate the contempt the minister has for his own legislation and the contempt he has for country school children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am further advised that, since the Senate committee met, the minister has diverted an additional $140,000 from CAP activities in Victoria&mdash;by the Commonwealth, not by the state. Is this true? If it is true, what contempt does that show for the parliamentary process when, at a time when the parliament is debating and discussing the future of this, the minister is going ahead as though the program had disappeared&mdash;just diverting when it suits him to do so. So I would be very pleased to hear the minister's answer. The minister talks about accountability and about not spending money specifically as it should be spent. What a contempt he has for the whole accountability process when, according to my information, he has diverted between $400,000 and $500,000 initially and $140,000 subsequently. </PARA>

I believe that this persistence by the Labor government not to maintain some equity through this specific program for those who are disadvantaged in rural Australia just shows the government's contempt generally for country people and a contempt also for the parliamentary process. I believe that the minister's credibility as a minister for all school children in Australia is very much at risk with this issue and he should think again before he perseveres with his original program.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter the debate this morning as a representative of a country electorate. Having heard some of the comments about the amendments we have received this morning, I felt that I must come down to the chamber to respond. Without doubt the country areas of New South Wales&mdash;indeed, I should say Australia&mdash;are well represented by Labor members, who are in the majority across Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel somewhat perplexed at some of the arguments of the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) who pointed out some of the recalcitrance of the Victorian government in approaching the allocation of funds under the disadvantaged schools program and the country areas program. As a representative of a country electorate and an electorate near a state border, I am well aware of the different processes and different guidelines that state governments use to implement the DSP, CAP and other federal government programs. I have had representations to my office on a number of occasions about what people see as the inequities of state governments implementing guidelines in different ways on the ground on either side of a state border. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be very surprised if the honourable member for Murray, whose seat also is alongside a state border, is not aware that state governments have had the freedom under the guidelines to implement the DSP and other programs as they see fit. In some ways I agree with that. I do not disagree; state governments are the implementers of education. They are the ones on the ground and the ones, if you like, at the coalface. But where I do find a little bit of tokenism in the arguments is in the bleeding over the move towards taking all these programs into the national equity program and the accountability that that will ensure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in my electorate is that two or three schools have been removed from the DSP program&mdash;schools in an area where incomes are very low. Without doubt the seemingly ad hoc implementation of those guidelines by the state governments needs to be questioned. We cannot get the answers from the state governments as to why they were changed. They will not answer the constituents of the Tweed as to why those schools have missed out. The same probably happens in other states. That is why I agree with the minister that we have to have the guidelines that we seek to put in place. We have to have the accountability for those programs to be taken in under the NEP. The bleeding that we have heard from those opposite does not seem to follow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill. I want particularly to respond to some remarks made by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell). The honourable member for Richmond and previous speakers in this debate have given the impression that the enthusiasm that the opposition has to protect the integrity of the country areas program has been generated entirely by some sort of political bias. Frankly, as the parliament and the honourable member for Richmond should be aware, all of the concern that has been expressed by the opposition is concern that has been generated not by members of the Liberal and National parties but by rural teachers across rural electorates. My own experience as the member for Wakefield, representing a rural electorate, has been that the lobbying in my office has come not from members of my party but from professional teachers teaching in rural areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These teachers are not the people who would normally vote for my side of politics or be supportive of what we are saying, they are teachers who come principally from an urban background. They are normally in rural areas on a short-term basis, have seen what this country areas program does, are enthusiastic about it and want it retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring to the attention of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) the fact that the thrust of this debate has principally been a thrust commending the government, as the honourable member for Richmond recognised, for this program and for the way it is run. It was recognised that the review that was conducted three years ago found no abuse of funding in the country areas program and, in fact, recommended that it be increased by $3.5 million, a recommendation that the government subsequently implemented in the year 1990-91. So our effort has been to commend the government. The concerns we have expressed have been expressed solely because they have been brought to our attention by, of all people, the rural teachers directly involved in this program. What we are saying to the minister is simply&mdash;not that there is anything wrong with the program; in fact, a bipartisan inquiry has reinforced that point of view&mdash;`Don't put this program at risk'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have an electorate like Grey, Kalgoorlie or Maranoa. I do not have vast rural areas; I have a relatively confined rural electorate. But within my rural electorate there are schools that will be directly affected by any change to the country areas program. Any opportunity that there is to siphon funds off from the country areas program into the disadvantaged schools program will adversely affect the schools in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me illustrate this point with one of them. As I said, my electorate is in a relatively populated area of South Australia. It is an electorate not unlike the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest). In the Mallee areas of my electorate there are schools which are totally dependent on this program. The classic one would be the Browns Well Area School. If a person drives over the sandhills to get to Browns Well Area School, all that is there is the Browns Well Area School. There is no post office, no church, no institute&mdash;nothing but that school, which is very dependent on this program. The staff of that school have brought to my attention the concerns they have about changes in the way the program will be funded and that these changes will see funds currently allocated to the CAP going to the DSP. Why are they concerned? It is not because it is a particularly small school, it is an area school catering from years of intake to year 12. The school has about 100 pupils, but it is distinctly disadvantaged because it lacks the opportunity for social interaction. The country areas program has given them a chance to implement real social interaction between Browns Well Area School and other schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is aware, as are all representatives of rural electorates, that these schools have become totally dependent on systems such as the DUCT system which allows for a real expansion in the curriculum. But it is not just curriculum that is covered by the country areas program. As the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has clearly pointed out, the country areas program allows for an expansion in the social interaction, an expansion that will be trimmed by the threat of country areas program money going into the disadvantaged schools program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are saying is simply this: we are supporting the government's existing program. We believe, as inquiries have indicated, that it works. We do not believe that the government should put it at risk. The people who will put it at risk will be the state governments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Chairman. That is very kind of you. As the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) has said, this is not about accountability. The mechanisms for accountability are there. I have always found that, when country schools report to their superiors, they take these matters very seriously. I do not think that has any credibility at all. The minister should know that quite well. He should also realise that this is nothing more than a very slick mechanism to allow the country areas program funding to be siphoned off into the disadvantaged schools program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members should remember that, when we are talk about the PCAP program or the CAP program&mdash;whichever they would like to call it&mdash;we are talking about disadvantages that are not easily overcome. We are talking about distance, lack of basic facilities and, above all, the lack of social interaction amongst children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I came into the parliament I was in the regional development field, so I know the area quite well. When trying to entice a company to go into a rural area, strangely the questions asked are not, `Where is the industrial land? What grants can I get from the government? What is the work force like?'. Quite often the questions that are asked are, `What is the quality of life like? What education will my kids get? How close are they to a university? Where is the nearest TAFE college?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to arrest this dreadful drift from the inland to the coast and from the south to the north, which speakers in this chamber have lamented in various debates over the years, we should do something basic and sensible to improve the quality of life in areas where we want to entice people. If we start to water down and take away programs such as the country areas program&mdash;I understand it has been running for nearly 20 years&mdash;then we are recording another vote of no confidence in those communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The country schools in some of those areas are, in many instances, the last vestige of the human face of government&mdash;not just for the kids, but often for the parents and for the communities. These areas have lost their court houses, their police stations have been downgraded, in recent times post offices have been shoved in the back of a store somewhere, railway lines have been closed&mdash;all sorts of things have happened. But the people still have to live there and quite often the focus of that whole community is the country school. The quality of the lives of the kids in that school is part of the morale of that community. </PARA>

I want to offer a couple of reassurances. First of all, I assure the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) that in 1993 there was no diversion of funds at all from the country areas program general element available to the state. I can assure him that next year no fewer dollars will flow to schools under this program. In other words, the financial basis of CAP is quite secure. In addition, we are funding a database which will allow the states to monitor performance better. In other words, we are giving them the tools to check the delivery of services to target groups.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) that, yes, I have met with people who are engaged in delivering services under the country areas program at the school level. As recently as last week, in the company of the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), I met with a group of people involved in the delivery of CAP services in his electorate. I believe it was a very good meeting. Those people were certainly able to explain to me the benefits of the program and the kinds of activities that it funded in a number of areas in the northern part of Victoria. They were pleased to be reassured that the practice of clustering could certainly continue under the new arrangements. Indeed, the ability to cluster in that state is very much in the hands of the schools and their communities. Those people we met with certainly understand what the government is about. They are cautious, as would anybody involved in the program be when changes are suggested. But that group of people certainly understands the scope that is available to use added flexibility to better advantage those who are the target group of this program. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I assure honourable members that, under the changes which the government proposes and which I hope this committee will endorse, the country areas program will continue to exist. The government is not reducing funding to the program. CAP funds will continue to be clearly identified. But the government is doing what the state colleagues of those opposite want us to do: give them, as system operators, added flexibility so that they can develop a better focus on educational outcomes for disadvantaged kids.

The Senate has announced its intention to cease deliberations in the course of this evening and to recommence them again on Monday. I think prudence would suggest that it would not be terribly sensible for us to convene on Monday to deal with any matters that might be coming back from it. There is some chance that we would be in a position to do that on Tuesday, hence the decision by the Government to seek the permission of the House to reconvene on Tuesday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have seen a perfect demonstration this morning of quality government from the Keating government! If there is one word that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is fond of using about his government, it is quality. Everything is quality. There were quality budget cuts, there is quality tax policy and this is quality government. This is a total farce. The reality is that the government does not control what is happening with its Mabo legislation. Its Mabo legislation is a total farce. The Mabo legislation ought to be deferred until the new year, until the people of Australia have had an opportunity to look at it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every day that goes by without the Mabo legislation being passed, the more nervous the government becomes that the fragile coalition it put together in order to get it through the parliament will fall apart. The reason that that fragile coalition would fall apart if this legislation were deferred until the new year is that many sections of the Australian community which would suffer adversely as a consequence of this piece of legislation would become aware of its negative provisions. They would understand that it is a piece of legislation that will divide rather than unite the Australian community. They would understand that it is a piece of legislation that will create different categories of Australians. They would understand that it is a piece of legislation which represents an adventurous and uncharted exercise in social engineering, the like of which we have not seen in the Australian community before. If this government had had the commonsense to recognise the role of the states in land management in Australia, I think it would have been a different matter. There is one other proposition that I would like to raise with the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), if I can perhaps grab his attention. </PARA>

She remains very much on the rack. We tried to move a censure motion yesterday and the government used its weight of numbers to deny us that opportunity. That minister ought to go.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was all this great drama about an historic sitting. It would be historic if we did something. What has happened this morning has been a complete farce and a complete waste of time. It is a complete farce and a complete waste of time because the government is trying to ram through the Australian parliament a piece of divisive, unacceptable  legislation. The government knows as well as I do that, if it allowed that legislation to lay on the table of the parliament over the Christmas recess, if it allowed people to have a look at it and allowed not examination in fatigue and exhaustion but examination with the benefit of a bit of reflective thought on what the legislation really represents, the people would wake up to the legislation and that that rather odd, fragile coalition that it was able to stitch together, which represented a number of groups in the community supporting a piece of legislation that will actually disadvantage them when the full impact of that legislation is known, would in fact fall apart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter what the quality of the legislation, no matter what the farce the government is exposing this parliament to, no matter how ludicrous it looks that, for the first time since June of 1929, the parliament sits on Saturday morning and the Australian public think, `Gee, this must be important. Maybe they are going to do something monumental', what do we do? We sit for a couple of irrelevant hours and, in the end, the Leader of the House says, `Oh, no, I have decided I have to tap the mat. I have to get you all up. You can all go home'. What a complete farce. We have an historic sitting on a Saturday morning for the first time since 1929&mdash;to achieve absolutely nothing. That is what I suppose the Prime Minister will be pleased to call `quality government under the Keating regime'. It is not quality government at all. It is a low quality farce and it will be seen as precisely that by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, the government is saying that we will come back next Tuesday. Given that it has not got the bill and that it is hell-bent on getting it before Christmas, it is not surprising that the government wants us to come back next Tuesday to try to get the bill before Christmas. Why on earth is the government trying to hide the minister for sport from the scrutiny of this parliament? That minister has rorted the funds of the taxpayers of Australia. That minister has been guilty of political corruption. That minister has been indicted as an irresponsible, politically corrupt minister by the Auditor-General of Australia and she ought every waking hour of her ministerial career be exposed to public and political scrutiny. Every day the parliament sits until that minister is sacked, she ought to be haunted by question time in this parliament. There should be no cover-up, there should be no protection and there should be no attempt to hide the minister from the scrutiny of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I say to the minister that under no circumstances can the opposition possibly support this motion unless the government is prepared to give us the normal facility of having a question time. The government did not allow one yesterday; it has not allowed one today. This will be the third additional day that this parliament has had to sit because of the government's bungling of the parliamentary programs. It will be the third occasion that we have had to sit additionally to when we would normally sit&mdash;and it is the third occasion on which the government is seeking to deny us the opportunity of question time. </PARA>

There are many things that can be put in ballot boxes: Christmas cakes and all sorts of other things. But I think it will be very interesting to see what happens over the next few days in this unexpected three-horse race. The bloke who really wants the position of Treasurer is my good old mate opposite&mdash;the Leader of the House. He would love to be the Treasurer of Australia. I would miss him, but he would really love to be the Treasurer of Australia. But the bloke that we have our money on is the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). We want Gellibrand!

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have two absolutely critical issues to the quality&mdash;that is a favourite word of the Prime Minister&mdash;and the integrity of government in this country. One relates to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and the way she has been politically corrupt in administering the sports rorts. The other relates to who will be the new Treasurer of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, the taxpayers of Australia are to shell out the quarter of a million dollars that it will cost to bring all of us back here on Tuesday to deal with the Mabo legislation&mdash;so the government hopes. It still cannot guarantee that we will have the Mabo legislation on Tuesday. The government could guarantee a sensible outcome if it agreed to put this lousy legislation off until the new year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could be going through this same farce again at half past four on Tuesday afternoon. The Leader of the House would then want us to support a motion that we have another sitting on the Wednesday&mdash;again with no question time. We could sit on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and all the while we would have Ros Kelly&mdash;I am sorry, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories&mdash;sitting there and we would not have the opportunity to cross-examine her or ask her any questions. We will spend half a million dollars getting the show together next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no guarantee that we can deal with the legislation. To make matters worse, the government will stop us asking questions about a politically corrupt minister and about who will be made the new Treasurer of this country. That only adds to the farce that is represented by this totally ludicrous and abortive sitting this morning. If the government had any sense of control over what really happens in this place and any understanding of the political chemistry of this parliament, it would have known that we would reach this ludicrous situation this morning and it would have said to people last night, when we were doing the valedictories, `Look, the Senate is clearly not going to deal with this legislation tomorrow. We might as well adjourn tonight and come back next week'. Instead, we go through the charade of this so-called historic Saturday morning sitting. I hope for the sake of the taxpayers of Australia that we do not have any more historic Saturday morning sittings. It has not achieved anything on this occasion and will not achieve anything on any future occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The root cause of this problem is that this government is trying to ram through this parliament a piece of potentially divisive legislation. The Mabo legislation will not unite this country; it has the potential to divide this country. That is why there is trouble in getting it through the Senate. The government knows that, if this legislation is not through before Christmas, that fragile coalition it has put together will disintegrate throughout January and it will not be able to get that legislation through. If that were to eventuate, then I believe that the best interests of the Australian people would be well and truly served. Unless I can get an undertaking from the Leader of the House that there will be question time when the parliament sits next Tuesday, there is no way that the coalition can support the motion that has been moved by him. </PARA>
