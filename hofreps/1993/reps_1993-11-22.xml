<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 14 December 1992 the government received an application on behalf of Mr Black's interests in which he sought to increase his holding in Fairfax from 15 to 25 per cent. The authors of this application apparently decided to publish this fact because it was reported in the press on 15 December. Mr Black followed up this application by speaking to me on the phone a few days later. At that stage I had not seen his application and simply confined my remarks to pointing out to him the FIRB procedures and to indicating that his application would be handled in the normal way with the Foreign Investment Review Board providing advice to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received the advice from the FIRB on Christmas Eve and I was offered essentially two options: either to reject the application as being inconsistent with the then existing policy relating to foreign ownership of mass circulation newspapers or to issue what is called an interim order under the appropriate legislation to allow the government time to further consider the matter. I chose the option of issuing an interim order.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which was published on 20 January. I conveyed this advice to Mr Black at about that time without engaging in any discussion with him about the merits or otherwise of his case. The interim order would provide a period of up to 90 days, during which time the policy options could be considered and the necessary consultation carried out with colleagues, particularly bearing in mind the earlier decision of the government and the earlier decision of the caucus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event, little was done prior to the calling of the election, at which stage I believed it was inappropriate for the government to give further consideration or at least to make a policy decision on this matter. Upon the re-election of the government, I prepared a submission to the cabinet which set out to review the policy for foreign ownership of mass circulation newspapers, and the government made a decision. The decision was announced in a press statement by me on 20 April 1993. I am happy to table that press statement. The press statement stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has agreed to the Telegraph increasing its shareholding in Fairfax from just under 15 per cent to 25 per cent. With foreign interest Hellman &amp; Friedman having an active five per cent involvement, the total foreign interest involvement will be at the maximum of 30 per cent. While the Telegraph will be the largest single shareholder in Fairfax, Australian investors will still hold the majority of shares in Fairfax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has determined that a single foreign investor can have a shareholding of up to 25 per cent, and unrelated foreign interests can have (non-portfolio) shareholdings of up to five per cent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the government made this decision, the primary and, indeed, sole argument advanced in my submission was on the basis that Mr Black, at this stage, was contemplating an expansion or a reinvestment in Fairfax. The total investment was in the order of $400 million, which involved investment in capital, printing facilities and the introduction of some new technology into the Fairfax business. The argument was advanced that, in order to protect Mr Black's investment at a time when this major reinvestment was going on in the company, it was sensible for his share of the company to be increased to 25 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not quite sure on what basis the opposition would raise this matter because it was well known, before the election and since, that it was coalition policy to allow Mr Black to take his holding in Fairfax to 50 per cent. The government does not support such a view. The government believes, consistent with its foreign investment policy, that matters relating to the mass media&mdash;newspapers, television, radio&mdash;are important and ought to be reserved primarily for Australian ownership. Such is the potential for them to influence social and cultural developments within Australia. I see that of course the opposition is essentially unconcerned about the Australianness of newspapers or, I assume, other forms of the mass media. This is something about which the government has a view, and the policy, as announced in April, remains the government's policy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has his attention been directed to recent reports that there is, among Australian business, a growing confidence at the rate of economic recovery in Australia? If so, is there any substance to those reports? Can the Treasurer tell the House of any specific information that he has that would support those reports?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3254" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. He referred to some observations I made on Thursday of last week about the consistency of economic data, all pointing in the direction of a strengthening of the Australian economy&mdash;a strengthening which is not spectacular, but which, nevertheless, is a strengthening, the evidence of which has now, I believe, become incontrovertible. We can look at the fact that there has been growth on the employment side of the labour market for the last three or four months and the fact that there have been some revisions to investment information which show that investment last year in plant and equipment was higher than had previously been the case. When we put this together with what is happening in the housing sector and in other parts of the economy, we see it is clear that the indicators are now all pointing in the right direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we would like employment growth to be stronger. Of course, we would like to see unemployment decline, and decline as quickly as possible. That is why the government has in hand the major reconsideration of employment policy, with the report of the appointed committee being handed to the government some time early next month, which will provide an opportunity for community consultations, leading to a government white paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My having made those observations, some reports have since appeared in newspapers. For instance, I noticed Friday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> carried a report of the latest Coopers and Lybrand study entitled `Employment Prospects in Australia'. In part, the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study of 1,300 firms . . . predicted that employment looked set to accelerate in 1994, with a clear net gain in the first half of next year.</PARA>
<PARA>On ABC radio's 12 noon news on Friday, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, Mr Allan Handberg, was asked whether he agreed that the signs of recovery were now becoming unambiguous. He said that the chamber's own assessment was `definitely consistent with' that view. This morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Claims by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, last week that the economic recovery is accelerating have been endorsed by the chiefs of two of Australia's four major banks.</PARA>
<PARA>This morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> reported the findings of a study by Access Economics&mdash;an organisation well known to and much beloved by the opposition&mdash;which have not yet been released publicly. The report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> quotes Access Economics as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The data thus suggests some pick up in investment is likely in coming quarters.</PARA>
<PARA>That might not be all that glowing but, remembering who the authors are, it is not too bad. The Chief Executive of the Commonwealth Bank said on ABC radio this morning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that we are seeing the Australian economy in that take-off phase.</PARA>
<PARA>I think there has been a perceptible change not only in what is happening in the economy as reported by the economic data, but also in the anecdotal information coming to Treasury from its surveys of business opinion and from those other surveys conducted on consumer sentiment, business expectations and the like. They all point to the fact that there is an expectation that things are improving. I think we are now seeing a coincidence of economic commentators' views going in that direction as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is hardly likely to be joyous news to the opposition, which has spent the last several years talking the economy down, but we can see that, despite its pessimism and its grim prospects, the economy is improving. That, I believe, is good news for the people of this country and particularly holds some better prospects for those people who are looking for work.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories to the Auditor-General's report on the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program. As the minister is aware, the government advised the Auditor-General that the selection decisions were made personally by the minister. The minister therefore would be aware of the grant of $95,000 she made to the Logan City employment training program. I ask: was the funding allocation in effect made to the Logan City workers rugby and sporting club? Was the club management committee at the time chaired by Mr Mark Forrester, who was, and is, employed by the federal ALP member for Forde? Is it correct that the so-called Logan City rugby club at the time of the grant did not have a playing ground on which to build a clubhouse, or even a playing team? In light of the minister's claim that all grants were based on need, and given the fact that the Logan City Australian rules club, among others, received nothing for a desperately needed expansion of its sporting facilities, I ask the Minister: whose needs were met&mdash;the sporting needs of the Logan community or the political needs of the honourable member for Forde and the government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OH4">Mrs KELLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week in parliament when I was asked a similar question, I outlined the basis for the assessment and the determination of these grants and I explained that the guidelines and the selection criteria are based on needs. I will not go into the details of the specific program announced by the honourable member, but I do not think anyone would debate that Logan City is a growth area and an area of need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the information of honourable members, I will go through those criteria again, and I am sure that honourable members&mdash;even the honourable member who asked the question&mdash;will see that Logan City could well fit into these criteria: a demonstrated community need for the proposed facility; evidence of the capacity for ongoing management and maintenance of the facility; evidence of a firm financial commitment from other funding sources for the project; a demonstrated consideration of access for people with disabilities; and the provision of child-care facilities where applicable is considered desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, very importantly, priority would be given to the needs of residents in new suburban areas, residents in inner urban areas, youth in the community, communities in rural areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, communities with high unemployment&mdash;I know Logan City fits into that area&mdash;and communities with a large migrant population, and again Logan City fits into that criterion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. In view of the strong export performance of the Australian services sector, can the minister inform the House of the contribution the services sector is making to Australia's economic recovery, particularly through exports to the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3256" SPEAKER="Griffiths The Hon A.G." NAMEID="0H4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="MARIBYRNONG" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Corio for his question. The Treasurer articulated many of the reasons why we can take increasing confidence in the level of economic activity in this country. But one area that very often is not acknowledged by observers is the contribution of the services sector to Australia's economic welfare. It is worth reflecting for a moment on the value of and the growth in those services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1993 the value of Australian services production passed its pre-recession peak and, at the same time, employment in that sector also exceeded the previous peak of 1989. The latter part of this year has also seen what can only be described as services sector industry profits rushing to record levels. In part, this strong growth in services explains the accelerating growth in the Australian economy. It is also important to observe the services sector underpinning the export performance of this country in the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Services now represent nearly 70 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product and 80 per cent of all jobs. The diversity and importance of services exports are not well known. They now comprise 20 per cent of all Australian exports. It is envisaged that over the next five years the services exports from community services alone, in which I know the Deputy Prime Minister has a strong interest, will grow by around 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transport and storage, communications, financial and businesses' services exports are very similar. The greatest opportunity for export services from Australia has been, and will continue to be, found in our own neighbourhood, if I can use that term&mdash;the Asia-Pacific region. There is tourism and telecommunications into Taiwan, Japan and Singapore; construction, engineering services and legal services especially into Taiwan and Hong Kong; and educational services into China and the ASEAN countries. These figures only highlight the importance of services exports to Australia's economic growth, of course to jobs growth and to our broader export performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key ingredients in the potential future of services exports is the freeing up of our trading relationships. The APEC conference in Seattle is vital to continuing the liberalisation of access for our services exports into those regional neighbours. I conclude by asking members of the House, when they talk about Australia's industrial and economic performance, to be cognisant of the considerable and growing contribution that services exports and output are making to our increasing gains in these areas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for her question. Yes, this is water week and I remind the House that improving water quality is a key priority of this government&mdash;one which I think enjoys the bipartisan support of the other side of the House, but not to the extent that those opposite would be prepared to commit the resources that we have to ensuring that we actually do improve the quality of the water. The purpose of water week is to generally raise community awareness as to the means by which water can be conserved on the one hand, and the ways in which different practices of utilising water can ensure that there is less detriment to the quality of the water supply on the other hand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, this week has given us the opportunity to announce two new important initiatives that will go a long way to committing resources to improve water quality. During the last election the government made a commitment through the environment statement made by the Prime Minister to commit $46 million over one year to improving the quality of water. A large part of this program was to address the problem occasioned by algal blooms, particularly in the Murray-Darling system, and to clean up the 10 hot spots along the Darling River. My colleague the honourable member for Calare, when in his previous local government portfolio role, worked actively with me in this regard, not just to identify the hot spots but to identify the solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Friday I visited Bathurst and had the opportunity to announce a new government program to encourage the better treatment of sewage waste&mdash;an area that has been a leader in this country in technological development. This is the next stage of that development. Essentially, it uses bugs and not chemicals to treat the sewage. But it also has the ability, when implemented, to provide a low-cost and adaptable system to many of our country's water supplies as well as having the potential opportunity to be exported overseas. It can essentially treat sewage at half the cost and, because it is an add-on to existing schemes, proves itself very adaptable in the process&mdash;and, importantly, it involves Australian technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of the program which we announced on Friday was the program to support the encouragement of innovative Australian technology in solving the problems of water quality. We announced the first 10 of the programs under that scheme&mdash;six out of those 10 will in fact go also to helping address the question of algal blooms. Two of the companies concerned in these programs in fact have their businesses in the electorate of the honourable member for Macquarie. They demonstrate the capacity of good Australian firms to come up with solutions, but continually struggle in getting to the commercialisation phase. Too often have we had the example where these companies have gone overseas to sell their wares only to be asked where they are in use in Australia. They cannot answer because the water authorities are not prepared to pick up Australian technology readily. This program, I hope, will address that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the government has a very strong commitment to improving water quality, and particularly to addressing the issue of algal blooms. It is prepared to commit substantial resources and it is also prepared to actively get behind good Australian companies in competitive, innovative solutions to meeting that problem.</PARA>

The minister has made it clear that she regards the report as a serious one, which she will take seriously, and that she will make changes to the way in which the program is administered to reflect the Auditor-General's recommendations.

Fewer than one in ten surveyed companies&mdash;in New South Wales that is about five per cent; Victoria, six per cent; South Australia, seven per cent; and Queensland, nine per cent&mdash;now anticipate declines. When this is taken into account, Victoria and New South Wales show up quite strongly in underlying trends.

It will be some time before they will show up. Even in those circumstances, as the Treasurer pointed out, the consideration that has been given by a whole variety of businesses now on what is likely in the next year or so indicates that we can expect, even in the Bureau of Statistics figures, some reasonable news during next year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member has a particular interest in local government reform and, notwithstanding the mirth on the other side of the House, the issue of reform in the area of local government is a serious one. Comprehensive reform of planning and development approval processes is an important area of micro-economic reform. Local government across Australia processed $24 billion in building approvals last financial year: $14 billion in new residential construction and $7.6 billion in non-residential construction. It is important to the national economy that we ensure that applications are processed efficiently. Recent research indicates that the streamlining of the process could potentially save the economy up to $1 billion a year. That is a very large amount of money and I want to test these potential savings in the real world of local government practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have reached an agreement in principle with the Australian Local Government Association to pilot a program which will computer link 50 councils across Australia. Computer programs are being developed in a number of states which will provide up-to-date information on the technical and regulatory requirements associated with the development. Applicants and councils will have at their fingertips the details about advertising requirements and specifications for different types of building applications. Importantly, they will also know the time by which the applicant should expect a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tracking of applications over time will isolate key pressure points and areas of delay which inevitably, and perhaps unfairly, are sheeted home to local government. The delays may have been caused by the applicants or unnecessary delays with referral authorities. If we could save three weeks in the process, the savings to the national economy and the community would be very significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Work undertaken by Baillieu Knight Frank in Melbourne indicates that delays in approvals cost the new home buyer $50 a day. If we extrapolate this amount across 150,000 annual building starts in Australia we have some idea of the magnitude of savings potential that is available. If we could save something in the order of three weeks&mdash;I do not believe that would be asking a great deal&mdash;that would amount to savings in the order of $160 million annually or $1,000 per house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of government in Australia, I believe we have not recognised the importance of local government as an area of micro-economic reform. The statistics that I indicate underline the very great significance of decisions made by local government for approvals. I do not think any member of this parliament who has had any involvement with the building industry would not have had some expressions of concern about the processes of approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the holding costs of land are very significant. We know that when those holding costs translate to a business they can influence whether a business is able to go ahead or not, just as they can also influence more flexible approaches particularly to design and construction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been very conservative in terms of our approach to housing and the opportunities we have provided for housing choice in this country. Very often we have not provided alternative approaches to construction simply because we know that the costs in terms of delays at local government level will be so significant if an approach is being taken that is very different. So it is important that we look at reform, and that local government takes some ownership of the reform process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than seeking to impose change on local government&mdash;as I believe state governments have often sought to do, rather unsuccessfully&mdash;this government seeks to work in partnership with local government to achieve a commitment to reform. I think in this area of approvals technology can be very significant. I would like to express my thanks to the Australian Local Government Association for its cooperation and we look forward to the results of this experiment which I believe could well provide a model for very significant and far-reaching reform.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not merely a case of the opposition alleging impropriety; this case is based on the findings of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General is an independent officer who reports to this parliament. It is the duty of this parliament to take up the report of the Auditor-General. He represents the people of Australia to make sure that their funds are expended properly and in accordance with high standards of administration. He has drawn to the attention of the people and this parliament a gross failure of administration, a dereliction of duty, a pathetic defence, a useless justification by this minister of how $30 million got to be expended in the course of three months before the March 1993 election and how that expenditure was skewed in such a way that not only did Labor-held electorates get more than coalition-held electorates, but Labor marginal seats got double&mdash;two for one funding&mdash;over and above Liberal marginal seats before the March 1993 elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General spent many months investigating this minister and this sports rorts program. He looked at the documents, he interviewed the staff, he asked for the documentation and he gave the minister every opportunity to put her case and explain it before he brought down his audit report. The minister engaged in correspondence with the Auditor-General and she sought to justify the role which she had taken. She sought to explain how these unusual coincidences had come about. The Auditor-General, fully taking into account her explanation, came to conclusions which are a damning indictment of this minister. This minister deserves censure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is either a knave or a fool, but I will tell her what she is not. She is not a person qualified to be a minister of the Crown. She is not a person who should enjoy the confidence of this House or the people of Australia that she can administer programs in accordance with her duty. She is a minister who has failed, who is not up to the mark and who enjoys the confidence of neither the opposition nor the Auditor-General, because this is a case which is made by an Auditor-General, an independent statutory officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the report was released on Tuesday of last week and the parliament became aware of the findings&mdash;findings that the minister had been aware of for months and had been engaged in correspondence with the Auditor-General about, to try to stop them coming out&mdash;the minister was given the chance to defend herself on Wednesday. She was given the chance to come in here, to table the documents, to show why the decisions were made, why this project got it and why that one did not, why this one got less than it asked for and why this one got all that it asked for. She was given the opportunity in a matter of public importance to explain this to the House and she failed. She failed to give an adequate defence or an explanation to this House. Even today when she was asked something so simple as to table the documents that she or her office relied upon, she was unable to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister has nothing to hide, why does she not come clean? Why do we have to go through this questioning process in this House as representatives of the people and ask a minister to come forward and release the relevant information and she is unable to do so? Do not say it can be pushed off to this committee, which does not have powers of subpoena or cross-examination, or it can be pushed off to that committee. Why does she not come in here before this House, of which she is a member and to which she is accountable, and come clean with the documentation? Covering up is even worse than the original failure. It is even worse to stand here and say, `I will not disclose this information' than it was to actually go ahead and act in the way she did. Many a politician&mdash;we remember the Watergate scandal for one&mdash;got into much more trouble for refusing to come clean early, rather than what he did in the original example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister completely failed. She said that she took the recommendations seriously last week, but what has she done about them? Is there one person in her office that has been censured or sacked? Is there one person in her department that has taken responsibility? Is there a minister that is prepared to take responsibility? Is there any action at all that she can point to whereby she has accepted these recommendations and has acted on them? She has done nothing and has disciplined nobody. People get sacked at the Lodge for misunderstanding the use of credit cards. But in the minister's office, she can dish out $30 million worth of grants without documentation, and what happens? Nothing. There is no action. There is a complete, blase refusal to take responsibility and to stand up here and say that corrective measures have been taken into account. It is a refusal to act like a minister, to come in here and assure the public of Australia that this will never happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a $30 million program of dishing out taxpayers' funds which apparently went ahead without anyone keeping records as to who got money and why. The reason the people in her office feel no tremor or no risk at all of discipline is that they were acting on her instructions. This was not an office out on some frolic of its own; this was an office that was acting in accordance with instructions. Therefore, the minister takes full responsibility for this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program actually started as the brainchild of Senator Graham Richardson&mdash;one who knows the value of a political dollar when he sees one. The program started back in 1988-89 by dishing out $13 million over three years. All of the money under that first program was dished out before the 1990 election. After the 1990 election we were told that there would be $30 million available over three years&mdash;$8 million in the first year, $12 million in the second year and $10 million in the third year. In the first year no money was spent. No money was spent in 1990-91. Why not? No election! There was no need to spend any money in that particular year. Even though no money was spent in the first year, by November 1992, on a program where no money was needed to be spent in the first year, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) topped up funds by another $18.75 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By this stage there was about $49 million left in the program&mdash;$49 million in the kick supposedly to be spent by July 1994. In the first two years of the program, between August 1990 and September 1992&mdash;in two full years&mdash;about $20 million was spent. But between October 1992 and January 1993&mdash;a three-month period&mdash;this minister approved $29.5 million. Two years to get $20 million&mdash;and in three months, between October 1992 and January 1993, this minister personally shovelled out $29.5 million of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it was a successful application the minister announced it herself; if it was a failed one the department wrote back to the project applicant and said there was no money. Do honourable members know why the approvals ceased in January 1993? Do they know why the $29.5 million cleaned out the whole of the program that was supposed to run to July 1994? A federal election was called on 7 February. The approvals ceased at the end of January and the election was called on 7 February 1993. I do not think it had any idea where the money was going. The Auditor-General reported a case study concerning a soccer club and stated:</PARA>

<PARA>These are the lights that the minister had approved for $47,000. The club then wrote to the department and proposed to erect the lights at another ground and the department approved that as well. So here we have moving lights. They are going up at one oval and the council says no; so they say, `We will put them up at another oval'. The lights were moving. This was a case study of how this minister was shelling out $29.5 million. They did not know the projects the money was going on, but they knew the electorates it was going into. The average grant to a Labor seat was $257,000; the average grant to a coalition seat was $141,000. To a Labor marginal seat, the average grant was $326,000; to a coalition marginal seat, to the dollar, it was on average one half&mdash;$163,000. </PARA>

He proudly boasted on the eve of the March 1993 election of how much money he had got; that is, how much of the sports rorts had been allocated by this minister to him so that he could go out and boast that fact as part of his election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No statute prescribed how the money was to be spent. There were no rights of appeal or review. It was only when the opposition alleged the money was being rorted that the Auditor-General went in to investigate. What he found must have made him absolutely aghast.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department reported that it was unaware of the selection process followed in the Minister's office and was therefore unable to provide any documentation which gave the reasons for the Minister's decisions. As a consequence ANAO asked the Department to approach the Minister's office to obtain details of the selection procedures followed in the Minister's office. The Department advised that apart from lists of approved grants grouped by electorate, most of the documents held by the Minister and her staff were on departmental files. On the basis of the departmental response in the previous examination of files the ANAO was not able to establish and therefore assess the process by which approved projects were selected.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the finding. The Auditor-General says, `Give me the documents'. The minister says, `The department has all the documents'. The Auditor-General goes to the department, and the department says, `We were not engaged in this process; this was being done in the minister's office. All we knew about it was that the projects were being grouped by electorate'. That is about all it was interested in. I think the only thing the minister's staff ever asked for when they got an application for funding was the Malcolm Mackerras electoral pendulum to show where the particular seat was on the dial. That was about all they were looking for. I say to the minister: where are the documents that explain why you gave $30 million of taxpayers' money out in a three-month period? How did you select who was to benefit and who was not?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Minister, it is a simple question: where are the documents? The same point recurs over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General even wrote to the minister&mdash;she is fond of relying on this particular piece of correspondence&mdash;and said, `We cannot find the documents in the department's files. Where are they?'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its response your Department stated that most of the documents held by you and your staff are on departmental files. However, to us there appears still to be a lacuna . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I had to look up the word `lacuna'. It means hiatus, blank or missing portion. Minister, we are looking for the missing portion of your administration. We are not talking about your capabilities here&mdash;however they may be described when we say `blank or missing portion'&mdash;we are talking about your administration. Where are the documents, Minister? Why can they not just be brought in? Why can you not say, `I approved Ralph Willis for this amount and for these reasons, and I knocked back somebody in a coalition marginal electorate for these reasons.'? Why can you not actually produce any documents to show the way in which you and your department were managing these particular grants? I think that the answer to where the documents are is probably contained in the report itself. The Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that in the latest round of approvals the Minister's office asked for details of the electorates in which the applications were located but was not prepared to put its request in writing when asked to do so by the Department, willy nilly can only lead to speculation about the basis for the selection process.</PARA>
<PARA>Why was the minister's office asking the department to give details of electorates where the applications were located but would not put it in writing? Was it because the minister knew that under an FOI request that kind of documentation would come to light? Was it because the minister knew that if she were called upon in this parliament to table the documents she would be caught cold? Was it so that her tracks could not be followed as she tramped through $30 million of political rorting in three months prior to the March 1993 election?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a case where it appears from the Auditor-General's report that the minister's office was deliberately covering its tracks. It was covering its tracks from this parliament; it was covering its tracks from the public; it was covering its tracks from financial administration; it was covering its tracks from financial accountability; it was covering its tracks in relation to a $30 million three-month spending spree to buy votes for the March 1993 election. </PARA>

There is some suggestion that she is so accident-prone that she has to be judged by a different standard.

It remembers the tape that could not be released which allegedly proved that the minister had not been bagging Prime Minister Hawke. But we on this side assert this principle: there is only one standard and that standard applies to all ministers. It is an even standard. It is a standard that says that a minister who cannot administer a department, a minister who cannot create an audit trail, a minister who cannot find documentation or clear herself of allegations is a minister who does not have the confidence and the ability that are required to be a minister of the Crown. </PARA>

Let me say, however, that there is one recommendation that I am not prepared to accept. One of the recommendations says that we should cut out communities who put in applications for small grants. Given that it is more difficult to administer the program with a number of small grants, there are many groups in the community who actually need it, and a grant of $5,000 in some of these rural areas in particular can make a terrific difference. It can mean the difference between whether it gets a community facility or whether it does not.

I would hope that in the spirit of honesty honourable members opposite will also appreciate the value of those grants that those communities have received. The reality is that honourable members have received grants in their electorates, and I hope they can see that the value of those grants was based very much on needs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member for Forde is not prepared to say that publicly, that is another sad indictment. This rugby club did not have a team it could put on the playing field. Indeed, it is still hunting for a playing ground on which to build this clubhouse. It has gone everywhere but it is not prepared to accept anything until it can get one that it is operating on its own. It still does not have grounds on which to build this clubhouse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from the criteria that, to ask for $95,000 to build a clubhouse, one must have approvals and somewhere to build the thing because, under the guidelines, it would not be granted otherwise. However, it may well be that those guidelines were for non-Labor seats. It may be that, when it came to Labor seats, the guidelines were totally different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might it be the case that, at the end of the day, applications were looked at in one of two ways. Firstly, coalition seats were assessed as to whether Labor could win them back. Secondly, Labor seats were assessed as to whether they were so safe that nothing need be touched. That is the double whammy. Not only was the Labor Party looking at marginal Labor seats but it was also looking at marginal Liberal seats or coalition seats that it thought it could win back. The whole thing was a double whammy. When it came to marginal Labor Party seats or marginal coalition seats, the criteria, which are specifically spelt out, were simply not followed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just witnessed an interesting hour or so of debate. The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), for all his passion, warmth and sincerity, reminded us of a used car salesman in the way in which he presented his case. For all that, his contribution was entertaining and I think most people in the chamber saw it as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sitting on this side of the House, I get a good view of a number of people on the other side. I could not help but look down at the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) who, at that stage, was sitting on the front bench straight across from where I am. I noticed that he had a fairly dour look on his face as the honourable member for Higgins was in full flight. I noticed also that he decided he had better pick up a copy of this Auditor-General's report and start flipping through it, which he did with a very stern face for the first 10 or 15 minutes of that address. One could not help but think of the odds that the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) has up on his window, shortening as the honourable member for Higgins launched into his tirade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is a bit more difficult to make any comments about the contribution by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the risk of upsetting the entertainment of the afternoon, let me introduce some facts into the debate. A lot of things have been mentioned about a Logan rugby union club by a person who would not know where Logan was on the map&mdash;even if he was shown. The Logan Sports and Recreation Club, I assume, is the organisation to which he refers. For his information, and the benefit of the House, I will inform the House that that club sponsors a number of rugby union and netball teams at junior and senior level&mdash;teams that compete well&mdash;and boasts amongst its ranks, as a member of that club, an Australian Wallaby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Logan Sports and Recreation Club services an area with 40 per cent of the residents born overseas and 40 per cent of the residents under 25 years of age. By any definition, it is in an area which warrants the sort of benefit which grants under this scheme provide. If the honourable member for Ballarat&mdash;the shadow spokesperson on sport&mdash;would like to find out where the money went and where the land and the building are situated, I am sure we can make arrangements for him to be escorted there so that he does not get lost on the way to Logan.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have another peculiar circumstance of a member who seeks to represent opposition members in regard to sporting matters as a shadow minister&mdash;and a number of people on both sides of the House are keen supporters of all sports activities&mdash;who flatly opposes a sports program being administered for the benefit of sporting clubs throughout the country. That would come as no surprise because in the opposition Fightback document the intention to abolish this program was made clear. It is in black and white in the Fightback policy. It is no surprise that those opposite should seek to continue this debate now, although one wonders why they did not take the opportunity that has been presented on other occasions such as at Senate estimates hearings and the supplementary hearing where, on two occasions, this department's estimates have been before the Senate for inquiry&mdash;and not one question was raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now they are kicking up a big storm and bringing on a censure motion, saying that this is the worst thing that has happened for years and requires the censure by parliament of a minister of the government. Yet the department has been through two Senate estimates inquiries with nary a question. Let us be serious about this; let us strip away the rhetoric and see this for what it is. Those opposite have had a policy for some years&mdash;at least the last 2 1/2 years&mdash;to abolish this program. It has been their policy in black and white. It may have been in the aftershock of the election defeat that these programs got through the estimates hearings, or a lapse in attitude, or something that happened to people on the other side of this building, but the fact is that at no stage during those proceedings did they seek to query this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, because the time is opportune&mdash;there is a leadership challenge, the economy is improving and they are fishing around in an endeavour to find some other issue that they can hang onto in the hope that the gallery might write something critical of the government&mdash;they drag this out of the bin and hope that the gallery will pick it up and run with it. This is a good program which has provided enormous benefit to people throughout the country. As one of those members in this House who quite proudly support a whole range of sporting endeavours I am a little embarrassed to admit that my electorate did not get as much money as that of the honourable member for Ballarat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the strange ironies in this debate is not only that the honourable member is the shadow spokesperson for sport&mdash;who wants to abolish funding for sport&mdash;but, at the same time, he has been quite happy to see a quarter of a million dollars in the last round go into his electorate to assist sport. Good luck to him and the people involved. That is $250,000 in the last round of grants. I must confess to the House that clubs and organisations in my electorate have benefited to the tune of $161,000. I am embarrassed to say that is $90,000 less than that received in the electorate of the honourable member for Ballarat who seems to think there is something terrible about this scheme&mdash;at least that is what he says here because it suits his purposes. But he is also very happy to put his hand out and pick up a quarter of a million dollars to assist organisations in his electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about the program, which is more than the honourable member for Ballarat did. The Mitchelton Sports Club in my electorate received $8,000 to upgrade kitchen facilities so that it met local government requirements. It could not continue to function without that sort of support. It is a long established, but small organisation which, quite frankly, still raises money out of raffles and the sorts of things that most small local organisations have done for years and years. The amount of $8,000 is not a lot of money in the scheme of things but it made a big difference to this organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pine Rivers police youth club, a fairly well-established and respected organisation in a growing area which now has one of the highest populations of teenagers in the Brisbane area, received $12,000 to help it with facilities so that it can get teenage kids off the streets and into the police youth club doing constructive activities. Those opposite should not tell me that it does not deserve that or that it does not qualify under the guidelines, because it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to mention the Brisbane Softball Association because softball is a mainstream women's sport. I have said in this place on a number of occasions that women's sport does not get the recognition or the funding it deserves. If it were not for programs such as this, women's sport would be in a much worse position. Women's sports organisations have enormous difficulty getting commercial funding and sponsorship because they do not get the media coverage or have that public profile. These are the very schemes that enable women's sport organisations to undertake the sorts of activities they do now. The Brisbane Softball Association received a grant of $16,000 to improve its seating facilities at its softball diamond. Last year it entered the national competition for the first time and the Brisbane team won the national softball competition in the first year in which it was a participant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Windsor Croquet Club, which is not a high profile organisation, received a small grant, which was extremely important to the people concerned. People who know Brisbane will probably be surprised, as I was, to hear that there is a croquet club at Windsor. It got a massive $5,000 grant. It needed to laser-level the field and put sprinklers in. Those people, who are all from low socioeconomic areas, were playing a game which is not usually associated with those sorts of areas and did not have the wherewithal to put in those facilities. They have those facilities now and they have a long-term tenure on the ground. They have been able to do that simply because this minister and this program have provided those funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will remind honourable members of the criteria. The first is a demonstrated community need. Every one of those organisations, and all the others that I have seen, had that. Secondly, ongoing management and ability to show that they could run the organisation. They all have that. And, thirdly, a financial commitment from other resources.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key aspects of this program has been the way in which the government has been able to get enormous community involvement and good return on the money that has been spent by ensuring that community resources go in as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those members opposite who bother to go out to their sporting clubs and talk to the people there, and their community organisations would know this to be so, a grant is given to one of these organisations&mdash;for example, a grant of $10,000 may be provided to assist in work. This grant is usually matched by another $5,000 or $10,000 in cash from the organisation concerned and then that is matched by another $5,000 worth of voluntary labour which the people in the club are only too willing to put in. So for an outlay of $10,000 the Commonwealth was able to see facilities built that would otherwise cost two and three times that value. It is a very cost-effective scheme which ensures that facilities are provided. In terms of accountability, the money is not provided until it is spent, receipted and the receipts are forwarded on. </PARA>

The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is the minister who not long ago accused the former Prime Minister of being guilty of crass politics. She is the expert on cash politics. She has desperately tried to buy election results around Australia through manipulating a grant system to assist marginal electorates in serious trouble. This is indeed, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) mentioned in the One Nation statement, a jobs program. It is a statement about providing extra money for jobs. But whose jobs?

I am sad to say that it is the poorest electorate in Australia. Did we get the biggest amount of grants? Were we generously treated under this scheme designed to help the needy? The truth is that the Wide Bay electorate got $65,808. This amount was not even up to the average of the electorates of the coalition members, let alone up to the average of the electorates of government members&mdash;and this is an electorate which is so critically disadvantaged by way of average income.

Our hockey players play one another. We meet as sister cities. Guess how much the electorate of Hinkler received? Not $65,808. The electorate of Hinkler received over $300,000&mdash;in fact, $340,000. The marginal electorate of Hinkler received $340,000. But it was not enough to save the member who told us that we did not have a rural crisis. Nonetheless, it was a pretty good try on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. The former member cannot blame the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories for losing his job; he can blame his own incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We go across to the electorate of Kennedy. It is another electorate which I am sure would have been on the minister's marginal electorate list. When I look through the list of grants for Queensland, I see that almost every second electorate mentioned seems to be the electorate of Kennedy. It was very generously looked after in this particular process; but it did not save the former member for Kennedy either. He was one of the many casualties of this election. The minister's cash politics were not enough to buy those kinds of electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is clearly no evidence, having regard to the balance of the grants that were received, that need was taken into account. The seven neediest electorates in Australia were coalition seats. None of them got a fair and square allocation of these grants. If we look at the grants that have been made and determine how well they fit these criteria, of the miserable $65,808 that the big-hearted minister was able to give to the electorate of Wide Bay, $5,500 went to the Kumbia State School. I happen to know the Kumbia State School very well. I went to school there. I played tennis on the tennis courts which are currently in a state of disrepair. So the Commonwealth government decided to give $5,500 so the parents and citizens could fix up the tennis courts at the Kumbia State School. The tennis courts need to be repaired, but surely the state government, that has already got billions of dollars of grants from the federal government, ought to be able to</PARA>
<PARA>fund that kind of program itself. My brother happens to be an office-bearer of that organisation, so I think I can be said to be making these comments without any degree of bias. The money was provided to help the state government of Queensland fix up some tennis courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another grant, $20,000&mdash;nearly one-third of all of the money that went to my electorate&mdash;went to a BMX club at Howard. The only complication is that the BMX club has closed its track at Howard. It has not started spending the money yet, but I am told it is going to build the toilet block even though the BMX club has erected a sign stating that the track is closed and people are not allowed to use it. These are the sorts of grants that are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the Ballogie hall committee in my electorate. In a rural residential area where there is probably around 70 per cent unemployment and no sports facilities at all, the local community got together in a self-help venture and proposed to move a hall into that region to provide the only sports and community facilities for a radius of perhaps 20 or 30 kilometres. That grant was not approved. It was more important to provide money to a football club in Brisbane that does not exist. When I looked through some of the other grants that have gone to Queensland, I noticed that the biggest grant went to the Mount Gravatt workers club. It sounds like a very logical place for the ALP to spend its money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other very significant grants. I was interested to note the grant that went to the Brothers rugby league club in Mackay. It was the third largest grant in Queensland. This is a club that has a very close association with the minister for primary industries in Queensland, that diabolical failure of a minister, Mr Ed Casey. This club has poker machines. It is generally regarded as being quite financially affluent, and it received $150,000. Of even more interest, the president of this club, which boasts amongst its membership Ed Casey, the Queensland Labor minister for primary industries, happens also to have been the ALP campaign director for the seat of Dawson at the last federal election. So the campaign director of the marginal electorate of Dawson managed to get something for an organisation that could be counted upon to do the right thing by Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are plenty of other examples as well if we go through the lists. In fact, almost every grant has its own story and scandal. There are examples of money that has been allocated to organisations that have had little or no community standing, but their chief attribute is their association with Labor. It has become clear that in determining these grants, about the only people the minister bothered to consult were Labor members of parliament. They were all invited to make a contribution on which allocations should be made in their area. Where there was no Labor member of parliament, somebody else had to be looked for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the electorate of Lyne, it seems the ALP candidate, Mr Dennis Driver, was contacted, because he announced that $100,000 of the money that was going to the electorate of Lyne&mdash;which was the biggest part of the allocation there&mdash;was going to the mid-north coast hockey association. This man had no standing in the electorate. In fact, the mid-north cost hockey association was not even in the electorate of Lyne at the time. It was only after the redistribution that it went into that electorate. So the man who announced this $100,000 grant to the hockey association was the ALP candidate. Those are the sorts of stories that we hear around the place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has really gone to cover over recent days. Anyone trying to find out any information at all about grants that have been made is being told that the information is not available. Even the parliamentary library is sending people across to the minister's office these days, as it has no answers to the various questions that people are asking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are criteria other than need, we are told. We have already demonstrated how need was so carefully taken into account in assessing these matters! There are criteria such as benefits to rural areas. This is another classic example of a criterion that has not been followed. The seven poorest electorates in Australia, according to the last census, are all in rural and provincial areas. That is a pretty disgraceful indictment of government policy for regional and provincial areas. Those areas have all missed out in a monumental way in the handing out of these grants. So it is clear again that the minister has not taken into account the needs of rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other criterion is job creation. This scheme got a mention in the One Nation statement&mdash;a top-up of funds to create extra jobs. My electorate of Wide Bay also, sadly, boasts one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia. What did it get? It received $65,000. That is only half the coalition average and only one-fifth of what was available to Labor Party members defending marginal electorates. That is the kind of balance and attention that there has been to the criteria that the minister herself drew up. Her department and her office handled all of these issues. Her office handed out the bikkies when the time came for the grants to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another very interesting thing about this carefully balanced and rational program that was supposed to be spent carefully over several years was that, lo and behold, in January this year, just before the federal election, two entire years supply of grants was announced. When this year's budget came along, there was no money left for new grants. When it came to the budget this year, there was no new money for this wonderful scheme that we have heard government members defending vigorously for the last half hour&mdash;this great saviour of the sporting world of Australia. It was all spent before the budget. It was all handed out by Labor candidates and members in marginal seats trying to get themselves re-elected prior to the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have learnt what the real criteria are for this program. It is based on need: the need for government members to get re-elected. It is based on unemployment and the need to create jobs: to create jobs for Labor members of parliament. It is based on the need to promote sport and other activities: the sport on this side of seeing a minister pathetically trying to defend the indefensible. This minister has been accident-prone. I instance the Kelly tape scandal, the infamous environment kit and the wet tropics compensation program. It is time she shut up and resigned. </PARA>

What an absolute joke!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to an article in the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> last Friday which purported to show, as the opposition is trying to show, that all of this money was handed out in marginal Labor seats to buy votes for Labor candidates. However, there was a slight problem with the article. The two examples it gave of marginal Labor seats with these big projects&mdash;one being in the electorate of Parramatta and the other in Macarthur&mdash;were both wrong. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) has left the chamber, but the project referred to as being in the seat of Parramatta is in fact in the seat of Mitchell, which is a Liberal seat. The project amounted to $200,000 for a basketball stadium. The project that was supposed to be in Macarthur, which was accompanied by a big photograph of the playing field in Campbelltown, was in fact in Werriwa. Even though it is not in my electorate, let me talk about the Campbelltown council project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Campbelltown City Council was funded with $100,000 for improvements to a playing field. The council thought it was so important that it added its own $100,000 so that it could spend $200,000 on this particular project. This was a playing field located in Fullwood Reserve at Claymore in the middle of a public housing estate. In New South Wales, public housing estates&mdash;most of which are in Labor electorates&mdash;are grossly neglected by the state Liberal government. Tenants in public housing estates are lucky to get their taps fixed&mdash;they are lucky to get basic housing repairs done, let alone the community getting any money for facilities. These areas are grossly neglected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Claymore Junior Rugby League Football Club probably saw that its only chance to get funding for a decent field was to apply through the community cultural, sporting and recreational facilities program. The club was successful and good luck to it. The club got $100,000 and the council, of which I was a member at the time of the funding application, threw in another $100,000. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Saturday I went and had a look at this project. The playing field at Claymore actually has grass on it now because of the funding that was provided. The club now actually has an amenities block. So the club no longer has to play on a field that has no grass on it. No longer do club members have to get changed on the side of the road before they play and miss out on a shower afterwards. Because funding has been provided to this project, the club has an amenities block and a field with grass on it. Yet the Liberal Party believes that is not on&mdash;that these areas should not get that sort of money. Apparently that money should all go to the North Shore. This is just another example of the total hypocrisy and lack of concern for the community that these people have. After all, this funding was provided through a community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program where the needs of the community are given priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard lots of figures quoted and, indeed, I am very concerned that these figures are quoted in the Auditor-General's report. Even though Labor holds only 53 per cent of the seats, 73 per cent of the grants involving 66 per cent of the funding went to Labor held seats. Is that not dreadful! Grants are based on need and, by definition in this country, given the political nature of the country, seats held by the Australian Labor Party usually have more needs because they are usually poorer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today in the House, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) asked why more money went to marginal seats than safe seats. I can only speculate that a lot of marginal Labor seats tend to be on the outskirts of metropolitan areas&mdash;the growth areas. They are areas like my electorate where there are new housing estates with rapid population growth, combined with some rural areas. So we obviously have a lot of marginal seats at the top of the priority list because of their demographic nature and the huge need for infrastructure. But, according to opposition members, these new areas should get nothing&mdash;the money should all go to their established seats. Look at the North Shore&mdash;that area has more money than one can poke a stick at. That area has plenty of green fields, green trees and everything else but the opposition wants more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ludicrous to try to allocate funding for any federal government program on the basis of electoral boundaries. Imagine if it was done for unemployment benefits. Most areas of high unemployment in places like western Sydney, the western suburbs of Melbourne or Newcastle or Wollongong tend to be Labor seats. Following the argument of these born-to-rule people opposite, are we going to say that there is a political bias towards the Labor Party in dole payments because most dole payments go to people who live in Labor seats? That is the sort of nonsense we get from the opposition. It makes about as much sense as saying that dole payments are allocated on a political basis because most of the people on unemployment benefits live in Labor seats. What an absolute joke!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken about the Campbelltown City Council project. I am proud to have been an alderman on the Campbelltown City Council when the grant was made. The council unanimously endorsed that project as its No. 1 priority over 18 months ago when the applications were dealt with. Let us have a look at some of the other areas that were funded in my electorate&mdash;and, of course, I was not the federal member at the time, I was only the candidate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the Camden District Netball Association. We have heard a lot of allegations today about people getting funding because they had an uncle on the committee who was a member of the Labor Party and all this sort of nonsense. Camden is a lovely little semi-rural area that prides itself on being part of the countryside. Camden is about to be hit by a fair bit of urban growth which is why it needs facilities like a new netball court, for which it has been granted $50,000. Camden applied for a grant of $100,000 but it only got $50,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that, if there was a bias towards Labor marginal seats, Camden would have got the whole $100,000 but it did not; it got $50,000. I have just moved over towards Camden and it is a very nice place. However, the township of Camden is hardly a bastion of socialism; it is hardly an area that votes strongly for the Labor Party. There is a very good chance that more than half of the mums and dads of the kids that play netball at Kirkham Park in Camden which got this funding probably voted for the Liberal Party. But I wonder whether they will next time because the Liberal Party does not think that Camden should have got this money. I might write a letter to all the mums and dads of the kids that play netball at Kirkham Park, telling them that the Liberal Party does not think they should have got the money, does not even support the program and believes that the money should have gone to the North Shore. What an absolute joke!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This program is very important. I can remember back in January when the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) came out to the Campbelltown City Council to announce funding for all of the grants involving the council&mdash;and some of the grants were for the seat of Werriwa and some were for Macarthur. As an alderman of the council, the mayor asked me to respond by thanking the minister for attending the function and providing the grants. I still remember what I said at the time: this program and these grants were about more than just providing money for a particular facility, and more than just promoting sport, the environment and the arts. I said that these grants were about access and equity for ordinary people and social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sneering members of the opposition do not understand social justice, they do not know what it means; they do not believe in it. But this government happens to believe in social justice and that is why these projects are based on community needs and not simply on arbitrary electoral boundaries. That is why slightly more funding has been given to electorates that happen to be held by the Australian Labor Party than those electorates that happen to be held by the coalition&mdash;the people opposite who do not care about social justice or the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the time, this program was about social justice, about providing access for ordinary people to the arts, sport and the environment. And the environment is also very much about access and equity, as is funding for sporting groups. The Claymore Junior Rugby League Football Club, which is in the middle of a public housing estate, got some funding from the federal government and had it topped up by the council, with the notable absence of any money from the state Liberal government. The Fahey government does not mind throwing billions of dollars at promoting the Olympic Games, and promoting itself, and having its Premier do world record high jumps on television when it gets the Olympic Games. But when it comes to funding public housing areas the state government gives nothing, and it is up to the federal government to fund these areas of need when it comes to sporting facilities or the arts or the environment or any other recreational facility. That is why a project like the Claymore rugby league field in Campbelltown was funded, and why it should have been funded like many others. If the opposition has a problem because some of them happened to be in Labor seats, that is tough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These projects were and always should be funded on the needs of the community.

They do not mind swanning around the North Shore or the northern suburbs of Perth, where the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) comes from, or all the other affluent, well-heeled areas. Talking of affluence, the article in the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> spoke of a comparison between Campbelltown and Hunters Hill, saying that Hunters Hill in the Liberal electorate of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) had only five playing fields and that Campbelltown had 179 playing fields. </PARA>

Of course, Campbelltown is a high needs area&mdash;as are marginal seats such as Macarthur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did get a bit of money in Macarthur. My electorate was given about $200,000, but most of that went to a project in Mittagong and two projects in Bowral. Once again they are hardly bastions of socialism. Those places got the funds because that is where the need was for those particular projects. There was an arts society project, a scout hall and, I think, an environmental project. There was also the Bradman Museum in my electorate. It has state-wide significance in terms of tourism and in the promotion of sport. I do not know whether the Liberal Party is suggesting that we should not have funded the Bradman Museum. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year there was a function in the northern part of the old electorate of Kingston in South Australia.

It is a magnificent facility built with funds allocated by the Labor government before the redistribution was held in the northern part of Kingston. I sat there knowing that I would inherit it should I win my new seat of Boothby, as that area was to be shifted into Boothby.

That is even worse than the illustration given previously in that wonderful speech by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). I do not take any pride in bettering him in the sense that those South Australian Liberal seats were deprived. It was a disgrace, and it was recognised as such.

The honourable member for Macarthur descended into some class warfare of decades ago to justify the minister's refusal to properly consider proposals from this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must have been a number of baskets&mdash;three in particular&mdash;in the minister's office: one, coalition; one, marginal; and one, blue ribbon Labor. It was clearly a political objective in the minister's mind to win an election with public funds; to buy votes with public money. I can think of nothing more disgraceful in the system of government administration than to be as blatant as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This may be a little unkind, but how on earth did the minister think she could get away with it? This is perhaps the unkindest thing: if the minister were being extremely devious about this, she would deserve the castigation and the censure of this parliament. I think she has been extremely foolish. If she thought she could hide it from this parliament, the Auditor-General, the committee system, public scrutiny and the anger of this side of the House, she does not deserve to have her portfolio. It is simply and clearly a matter of the minister's incapacity to do her job. She is unable to hide what she ought not to have done in the first place. She fails on two points, one of which is her incapacity to administer. I entirely support the censure motion against her. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This censure motion has been turned into a farce. I want to make a couple of points before I go to the thrust of the arguments. I want to pick up some of the comments made by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). I wrote this comment down about him. He said that almost every grant has its own scandal. They were his exact words. Minister, you should write to every one of those 1,000 organisations who got a grant to make the point that the honourable member for Wide Bay implied in this House that there is a scandal associated with them. I hope that you do it, and I hope that you do it soon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the information that he put when he went on about all of these low income electorates which are held by coalition members, firstly I suggest that he check the demographics provided by the Parliamentary Library; he will find that is not right. Secondly, he went on to complain that in his own seat only $60,0000 worth of grants were allocated. We have done some quick checks and $80,000 worth of grants were allocated. He does not even know what happened in his own territory. He made the claim, when he talked about the Mount Gravatt Workers Club, that it got the largest grant in Queensland. He conveniently forgot to mention that an organisation in the electorate of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan)&mdash;a Liberal member&mdash;received a $200,000 grant. I refer to the Runaway Bay Sports Club. If he comes in here and makes those sorts of allegations, then he had better get the facts right and not just stand up and wheel off something that sounds good in Far North Queensland. It does not stand up to scrutiny in here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are about here today is really not so much a complaint about the administration of the program but the aftermath of an appalling political decision made by those on the other side of the House. Their judgment was to dump on this program, to oppose it and to publicly say to the constituency, `We oppose it'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely, I have. So every one of those 1,000 communities that got a grant, whether they were in Labor or Liberal seats, knew that you were committed in your $10 billion spending cut in Fightback to dump this program. That is why you got rejected; that is why it hurts now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to note that this program has been around for five years. It did not just appear before the last election. It has been around for five years; it has been administered for five years on exactly the same needs basis. If you went back and studied the statistics for the five years, you would get the same outcome. Yet, as the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) mentioned in his contribution, you have had two opportunities at Senate estimates committees to make the same complaints, but you have never raised them. In the last five years you have never raised them once. Now that you have been stung in the tail, now that the community has dumped your Fightback proposals and rejected your proposal to scrap this program, all of a sudden you are becoming excited about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has a dilemma; I know that it has a dilemma. When your leader says, `No, let's dump this,' but your community groups say, `Yes', what do you do? Some of you actually make representations. </PARA>

As I mentioned in the debate here the other day, in some of your electorates members actually even refused to write a letter of support for a grant. It took other groups in the community to support them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some very interesting anomalies. You have all been on about anomalies. In the very safe Liberal seat of O'Connor, a substantial grant was made to the Ravensthorpe community on the basis of a recommendation&mdash;because the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) was not interested&mdash;from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) on our side. I am sorry to have to point this out to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, but he informed me that a grant was made to a project in Broome which he did not know about and, therefore, was not in a position to support, but the opposition's Senator Panizza did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that these grants were made, as has been outlined, on the basis of need in the communities. The programs were supported by honourable members on our side and on the other side, and they got funding. I am in a very embarrassing position, because I am from a marginal Labor seat&mdash;my margin at the last election was three per cent&mdash;in central Victoria. I am surrounded by three seats held by members opposite. I got a measly $200,000 for my electorate, which is a matter I am going to have to discuss with the minister. Looking at the seats around me, there was an amount of $200,000 in the electorate of one of the complainants, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson); $400,000 in the electorate of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid); and $200,000 in the Liberal seat, as it was then, of McEwen. My electorate got a $200,000 grant while those electorates around me got nearly $1 million. That was a pathetic effort on my part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bendigo engaged in a very grubby act on the weekend. I happened to notice in the Bendigo media that the honourable member for Bendigo complained publicly that a particular community group did not get funding in the round. He complained that the minister discarded the group because she had put the money into marginal Labor seats. But in his press release the honourable member for Bendigo did not say that about five other organisations in Bendigo got $400,000&mdash;one of the largest allocations anywhere. There was no admission of the grants that were made in Bendigo. It was a grubby political claim that this particular group missed out because the minister took the funds somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a very disgruntled opposition with absolutely no commitment to this project whatsoever. Let us get to the heart of the reason for the program. When something like the Australian Institute of Sport is established in Canberra, it is not sufficient to just invest in the AIS and then hope that somehow the rest of Australia will produce people who will make their way through. We have to go into the community with a deeper and ongoing commitment to assist with the development of recreation and sporting facilities. That is what the heart of the policy is about. I do not understand how people opposite in their party room could reject this. I will bet that their communities do not understand why they are not interested in helping out the tennis clubs, the softball clubs, the football clubs and the gymnastic clubs&mdash;all the clubs&mdash;that have received relatively small grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talked the other day about a very interesting example in the western suburbs of Sydney. The minister will remember the multiplier point that was made before, and I will go to it now. Think also about the context in which this last round of grants was made. The grants were made last year at a time when the community was calling for government action on jobs. The minister made commitments to a whole range of organisations. There was not a lot of money involved. Those opposite say $30 million. That amount in an annual budget of $100 billion is very little. But that $30 million produced a multiplier effect of at least $100 million because everyone of those sporting grants, as the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) said, required a capital contribution from the local community and, in many cases, from local government. So, for an investment of $30 million, we produced quick smart $100 million worth of community works and jobs that have seen a range of worthwhile projects put on the ground. They have been part of the stimulation of the economy that we are now seeing. We are now seeing jobs put on the ground and the economy in recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the minister that, even though it was not a lot of money in broad budget terms, it played a significant role in getting jobs going at the local level. In this respect, it is absolute garbage for those opposite to come in here and say that the money was given to marginal Labor seats while ignoring the fact that it went to marginal Liberal seats and ignoring the fact that safe seats on both sides of the House got it. Those opposite have come in here and said that low income National Party seats did not get grants when they did not even know in their own electorates what the grants were, for God's sake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the censure motion has turned into a farce. Those opposite have tried to score cheap political points when they are not interested in the program. They wrote it out of Fightback. When the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) wandered into the party room with the birthday cake and the policy, those who bothered to read the policy knew that it was dynamite to rule the line through community sporting and recreational grants. Half of them found themselves in the dilemma of saying, `What do we do when Dr Hewson says no, but our community says yes?'. Half of them slunk around the back door. They did not want anybody to know they were supporting us or supporting their local community groups. They got grants. The rest played the game and did not take any interest. In some cases they actively opposed it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are electorates on the other side of the House where groups were told not to bother even applying because the program was no good&mdash;and then they wonder why the people who enthusiastically supported the program got grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of documentation, the Auditor-General has made it absolutely clear in his report that the minister has made available, or is willing to make available, anything that he asked for. If those opposite go to that report, they will also find that the Auditor-General did not claim that these grants were politically motivated. If they are going to come into the House and make the claim that these grants were politically motivated and that the Auditor-General said that these grants were politically motivated when they know very well he did not say that, then they devalue their own arguments, and they absolutely devalue the point of a censure motion in this parliament. Mr Speaker, I can assure you that the minister and the program have the absolute support of every member on our side of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the final comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe) before the division, he accused me of having understated the grants that were made to the Wide Bay electorate. My figure of $65,808 was based on the list of approved projects, which came to me from the office of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in January this year. It was made up of: Curra Country Club, $12,000; Howard BMX Racing Club, $20,000; Kumbia State School, $5,500; Torbanlea Community Hall, $25,000; and Maryborough BMX Club, $3,308. That makes a total of $65,808, the figure which I earlier quoted. I would welcome any additional grants, but those are the figures as I understand them to be.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill amends the Migration Act 1958&mdash;the act&mdash;to simplify the operation of the points system provided for in the act. The points system provides for the application of a competitive points test which is used to assess people of working age seeking permanent entry to Australia under the independent entrant and concessional family classes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently, the points system sets out three marks against which an applicant's score is compared&mdash;applicable pass mark, applicable priority mark and applicable pool entrance mark. Currently the way in which the points system operates is that the pass mark and priority mark are set at the same level and a pool entrance mark is set at a lower level. Applicants whose score is equal to or more than the pass and priority mark proceed to further processing and applicants whose score is less than the pool entrance mark are rejected. Applicants whose score is at least equal to the pool entrance mark but less than the pass mark are placed in the pool and can be removed by meeting a subsequently gazetted pass mark. However, applications in the pool that fail to meet the pass mark after three gazettals are rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Variations in the pass and priority marks is one way that changes in demand for migration are managed between one program year and the next. Adjustments can be made to the level of the pass mark and priority mark to control the number of applicants who would be able to proceed to further processing. Therefore, where the number of successful applicants is inconsistent with the program planning levels the priority and pass mark can be lowered so that more applicants move to the next stage of processing or they can be raised so that fewer applicants move to the next stage of processing. The numbers in the pool can be increased by lowering the pool entrance mark, however the pool cannot be reduced by increasing the pool entrance mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of problems with the current operation of the pool mechanism. First, rejection of applications in the pool requires three pass mark gazettals and an applicant in the pool must be notified on each occasion. This process is administratively cumbersome. Secondly, there is no time requirement in which the three gazettals must occur. Therefore, they could occur on consecutive days or over a number of years. This provides little certainty or security for applicants. Thirdly, the system provides little flexibility to reject those who receive lower marks in the pool. Finally, the current system of three different marks has confused applicants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will remedy these problems by replacing the three mark system with a two mark system consisting of a pass mark and a pool mark. The bill will also simplify the operation of the pool mechanism by introducing a mandatory time limit of 12 months after which time an application still held in the pool must be rejected. This will replace the current requirement of three pass mark gazettals which, as previously stated, could have occurred over a period in excess of 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the scheme proposed in this bill an application where the assessed points score is at least equal to the gazetted pass mark at the time of assessment would proceed directly to the next stage of processing. An application where the assessed points score is less than the gazetted pass mark but at least equal to the gazetted pool mark would be placed in the pool. An application where the assessed points score is less than the gazetted pool mark would be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill sets out the manner for dealing with applications in the pool and provides that an application in the pool must be assessed against any gazetted changes to the pass mark and pool mark during a period of 12 months from the date of the original assessment. At any time over the 12-month period an application in the pool could proceed to the next stage if the pass mark is lowered, or be rejected if the pool mark is raised. If an application had not been removed from the pool by either of these means at the end of the 12-month period it would have to be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Variations in the pass mark and the pool mark will be notified in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS>. Each time these marks are varied an application in the pool will have to be compared with the varied marks. The bill makes it clear that this comparison does not allow a reassessment of the applicant's assessed score. The bill also makes provision for the pass mark and the pool mark to be varied independently of each other. When the pass mark and the pool mark are the same, no pool would exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transitional provisions in the bill ensure that applications that are held in the pool on commencement of the provisions will be held in that pool for a further period of up to 12 months. This will ensure that no applicant is disadvantaged by the operation of the new provisions. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the 13 March election there could not have been a clearer choice between the Australian Labor Party and the coalition on industrial relations. The importance of the award safety net and the maintenance of the federal system of conciliation and arbitration were major issues in at least one former federal election, that of 1929. In that election, too, the Australian people rejected another conservative challenge to their system. In that election, the Prime Minister who proposed this change lost his seat. On 28 August 1929 in this House E.G. Theodore described the coalition policy as a wreckers policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How little has changed. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill is a product of the mandate given to the government to maintain the award safety net; but it is more than that. The no disadvantage test in the legislation will ensure that enterprise agreements are not simply wage cutting exercises but lead to sustainable and dynamic productivity agreements. The changes in the structure of the world economy in the last 10 or 20 years have been vast and sometimes overwhelming for workers and business, especially small business. Employees, who know their wages and conditions will be protected, obviously will be more prepared to participate in improving the performance of their workplace. The challenges are definitely there for government to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, especially the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and his ilk, has literally thrown out the like of Ian Macphee from the Liberal Party and silenced all opposition in relation to industrial relations, simply adopting the approach of Thatcher in the United Kingdom and Reagan in the US. There is less unanimity among employer groups concerning industrial relations than there is in the coalition. The Keating government, with this legislation, is signalling two major points for trade unions and employers. One is that the low wage, deregulationist path is totally rejected; and the second&mdash;and equally as important&mdash;is that trade unions in the 1990s and beyond must maintain their attempts to grapple with change and deal with it in a strategic manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wreckers policy of those opposite&mdash;if ever implemented&mdash;would give two very different signals. The first would be low wage outcomes, leading to a decline in living standards and reflecting higher wage differentials between different segments of the labour market. The second would be a return to the law of the industrial jungle. I am reminded of something which affected my electorate a few years ago&mdash;the pilots dispute. It was very significant to see the attitude of the opposition and its spokesman, the honourable member for Bennelong, about that dispute&mdash;their intentions were clear. The honourable member just sat on his hands when the whole integrity of the centralised wage system and the system of industrial relations were put in jeopardy and while the tourism industry in my electorate bled. That is the promise of events to come if the coalition is ever re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, the Australian people have rejected this approach. Under this legislation, employers and trade unions will have to make adjustments. Employers, especially small businessmen who operate very much at the margins, will not have the easy option of reduced wages and secret contracts. Trade unions will also have to compromise under this legislation. They will have to accept a form of enterprise bargaining which envisages non-unionists participating in the industrial relations process. That is a major concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government is confident that the rewards from these changes can be great. Overseas, both the United States and the United Kingdom have adopted policies similar to those proposed by the opposition. In other comparable countries, such as Germany, we can seen that low wage policies are not necessarily the answer. The German experience shows that low wage policies do not necessarily lead to the outcome which those opposite would advocate. Employers there, operating in an environment of high and rigid wages plus legislative employment protection, have been forced to adapt their product ranges to the non-price competitive markets capable of sustaining a high level of wages. This has happened in the high performance industries with high levels of productivity. I quote from an article by Ken Davidson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 13 March this year. In relation to Germany, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">High employment security creates an incentive for employers to maximise internal labour flexibility to compensate for external rigidity in the form of spending on training and retraining.</PARA>
<PARA>Because of the maintenance of a system having some similarity to ours, instead of going for the low wage option, employers are forced to spend money on training and retraining, effectively enhancing the productivity of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further comparisons are made with the United States and the United Kingdom. Studies show no startling improvements in jobs or productivity derived from labour market deregulation. Plainly, labour market deregulation has meant a downward movement in wages there. Lower wages, effectively, have reduced the incentive for skilling and reskilling. Where is the incentive to improve productivity if wages are declining in real terms? We cannot compete with Asian labour markets. There is no doubt that wages and salaries in Asia are increasing, but not at the pace at which we could ever compete&mdash;at least in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, industrial relations was a major issue to the Australian people in the election campaign. I know this not only because of the undoubted high level of support given to me and other Labor candidates by the organised labour movement in the election, but also because of the number of times the issue was raised with me on the campaign trail when I was doorknocking and talking to people in shopping centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many workers in Cairns are still non-unionised. In my encounters on the campaign trail it was these workers who were generally fearful of the coalition's policy. They were frightened of jobsback. They feared exploitation and wanted the award safety net extended to them, not taken away. This legislation very significantly does this by the implementation of minimum standards. I know that my electors reject the coalition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently attended a meeting of approximately 300 workers in my electorate of Weipa. They are very concerned that Comalco is still trying to impose&mdash;they say by intimidation&mdash;individual contracts in Weipa. At the meeting, these workers were not asking for increased wages; in fact, the contracts that were offered to them increased their wages. But they want more than that: they want job security and the maintenance of the award conditions, which are very important to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not understand the Australian people. Workers are not concerned about wages&mdash;obviously wages are important to everybody, whether they are family people or single people&mdash;they are more concerned about conditions of work and their lifestyle. This is the great irony of the coalition's industrial relations policy generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People can now shop in Cairns on Sundays and most days of the week. I think this applies right throughout Australia. Here in Canberra one can shop almost to the middle of the night. Who is supporting those changes? Obviously consumers have been benefiting. The very people who talk about family values drive people to work on Sundays. The opposition is also opposing this legislation which, very clearly, entrenches equal work for equal value. It opposes this legislation which imposes paid maternity leave. So much for family values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workers at Weipa told me that this legislation does not go far enough. They want to know why, after the Labor government was elected, Comalco was still able to force individual contracts onto them. I think this demonstrates how out of touch the coalition is with the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to call on Comalco to recognise the mandate that this government has and the will of the people that was given to this government in the last election. I call on Comalco to get on board and join with other employers in Australia to help develop a more cooperative and productive industrial relations system instead of seeming to go on the course that it is at the moment in terms of industrial confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the coalition recognises the fear that its policies place in the hearts of ordinary Australians. It is a fact that economic change has engulfed the world and caused enough fear. There is real fear in the minds of Australian men and women. People are frightened about downsizing and restructuring. There was a time when I would have been a little more critical of this government and its predecessors in the 1980s for going too far with structural change too soon, but I now recognise that much of that change is inevitable. The accord between the trade union movement and the government has been successful in ameliorating the harsh effects of these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade union movement in Australia has shown considerable maturity to adapt and compromise, but the government has to play a very strong role. The current labour market programs must be maintained and enhanced. We must provide more flexible options for employment. Obviously the government is going through a process in relation to its employment strategy. The caucus task force has already presented a paper. It is very significant that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has also distributed a paper which talks about more flexible options in relation to labour market programs. I think a lot of the things that the minister says in that paper are very interesting and worth support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters are inseparable from industrial relations policy. The choice for Australia is very clear: we have a choice between a high performance industry or a low wage structure. That is the very clear difference between government and opposition in this debate. We have a unique opportunity in this debate to choose between a low wage option or an option that provides high performance industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, we can contrast the performance of Germany, which has gone down the road of maintaining living standards for workers, job security and high wages, with that of the United Kingdom and the United States, which have opted for deregulation and a low wage structure. When we look at the figures, we see that the performance in Germany is better than it is in the United Kingdom and the United States, which have opted for deregulation. I challenge the honourable member for Bennelong or anyone else in the opposition to show anything in the figures which have come from the states which have adopted a deregulationist policy and which would indicate anything better in performance and job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian workers have made sacrifices in the last 10 years of the accord. These sacrifices can lead to an optimistic future. Australia's productivity or output per person employed is higher than all countries in the region, with the possible exception of Japan. Australia rates 10th in the world on the basis of GDP per employee per hour. That compares with Japan, which is 20 per cent higher and rates 20th in the world. We can achieve our objective of strong export industries without wage discounting. This bill provides the legislative framework to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to this debate will be in a narrow compass. I intend to discuss only the government's intention to create a new labour court, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, which is a key aspect of the Industrial Relatons Reform Bill. Under the bill, it is proposed to eliminate the jurisdiction of the Federal Court in industrial matters and to transfer those matters to the Industrial Relations Court which is to be established. The coalition opposes this for a number of reasons. First, the government has not demonstrated any need to set up the new court. The second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) does not attempt to make a case for it. Secondly, the establishment of specialist courts operating in narrow fields is undesirable. Thirdly, the new court will result in unnecessary cost to taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill seeks to add a new part XIV to the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to establish the court. This proposed part details the constitution of the court, its administration, its original and appellate jurisdiction and other matters necessary for the establishment of a judicial body. The bill seeks to repeal sections of the 1988 act which give jurisdiction to the Federal Court. The separation of judicial bodies from other institutions in the federal relations system occurred in 1956 following the High Court's decision in the boilermakers' case. That decision limited the ability of bodies constituted other than by federal judges to determine judicial questions, or exercise judicial power. The result was the transfer of the judicial functions of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to the Commonwealth Industrial Court. That court later became the Australian Industrial Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1976 the Federal Court was established with a general division and a specialist industrial division. With the establishment of the Federal Court, the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Court was transferred to the industrial division. The Federal Court's jurisdiction in federal industrial matters continued following the enactment of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently, under the 1988 act, the Federal Court has jurisdiction that covers proceedings to enforce or interpret awards, disputes as to the conduct of affairs of registered organisations and references of questions of law by the commission. Under the bill, all jurisdiction that is given under the act to the Federal Court will be transferred to the new court. In addition, in relation to sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act 1974, the Federal Court currently has jurisdiction which relates to secondary boycotts. It is proposed in the bill to remove those sections from the Trade Practices Act and to incorporate variations of them within the new act. Jurisdiction to determine issues relating to secondary boycotts is to be with the new court. So, too, will there be with the new court the enforcement of employees' entitlements under the new minimum entitlement provisions of the bill&mdash;a matter on which I will comment later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been completely silent in explaining the need for the establishment of this new court. No rationale is provided in either the second reading speech or the explanatory memorandum. This silence is really quite extraordinary. The government is proposing, in effect, to abolish a whole division of the Federal Court and create a new federal judicial body. It has not bothered to say why it is proposing to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qualification for appointment as a judge to the new court is detailed in the bill. A person may be appointed as a judge if the person is a judge of a certain federal or territory court, or if the person has been a legal practitioner for at least five years. A current judge of the Federal Court could therefore be appointed a judge of the new court. The bill specifically allows a judge to be a judge of both the Federal Court and the new court. However, we have no indication as to the practical intention of the government in relation to the constitution of this new court. Does it intend that certain Federal Court judges will be appointed to the new court and hold dual appointments? Does it intend to make new appointments? In either case, there is no explanation why existing Federal Court judges may not continue to exercise industrial jurisdiction in the Federal Court or why new appointees could not simply be appointed to the Federal Court in its industrial division.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes that the new court have jurisdiction concerning enforcement of employees' entitlements under the new minimum entitlement provisions. This warrants special comment. The Industrial Relations Court is proposed to be a superior court, on the same level as the Federal Court and the supreme courts of the states and territories. Below the superior courts, there are two other levels&mdash;the intermediate level, comprising county courts and district courts, and the third level, comprising magistrates' courts. No case is made for transferring jurisdiction in particular cases relating to minimum entitlement provisions away from where they are presently largely heard&mdash;in industrial magistrates' courts. A special case would have to be made to justify transfer of jurisdiction from the magistrates courts to the intermediate level, but an even more special case would have to be made to justify transfer to a superior court. Neither case, of course, is addressed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter does not end there. Provision is made for the particular category of unfair dismissal cases to be heard not by a judge but by an officer to be called a judicial registrar. Under sections 71 and 79 of the constitution, the judicial power of the Commonwealth can be exercised by a judge of the Federal Court. In 1991, in Harris v. Caladine, the High Court considered whether the judicial power of the Commonwealth can be exercised by a registrar. The result, in summary, was that, for a hearing before a registrar to have validity, it has to be open to review by a judge. This bill relies on that principle. The review is plainly intended under the bill to be what is usually referred to as a rehearing de novo. In practical terms it means that, if a party does not like the result before a judicial registrar, the party can in effect&mdash;subject to some procedural limits&mdash;have another go. This is a right not accorded to most other litigants. It is certainly not accorded to any other litigant bringing or defending what is, on proper analysis, a common law claim. It is discriminatory. It is wasteful of Commonwealth resources. It is potentially expensive for the party who may have to resist a hearing twice. Above all, it is totally unnecessary and should not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The courts are one of the three branches of our system of government. Insulation of the judicial system from arbitrary executive or legislative whim is vital in securing the integrity of our courts. For that reason alone, the parliament should refuse to entertain elimination of significant jurisdiction of the Federal Court tantamount to an abolition of an entire division of the court without a detailed explanation as to why. It may well be that the government has reasons which it believes justify this change. If so, it should advance those reasons publicly so that they can be scrutinised and debated. Without any reasons being offered, there is the potential for a perception of an improper motive, and a perception of impropriety can be as subversive as impropriety itself. The Law Council of Australia recently commented in a letter dated 5 November 1993 to the secretary of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training that the matters referred to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . give cause for concern that the underlying reason for the establishment of the court may be an expectation that a different kind of law will be applied there, possibly within a less independent legal culture.</PARA>
<PARA>If the concern is about the content of laws applied in the industrial area, the focus of attention should obviously be those laws. We do not reform laws regarded as inappropriate by changing the court which administers them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further danger in the creation of small specialist courts. This concern has been specifically raised by the Law Council of Australia. Where a judicial body of limited size and specialised jurisdiction is created by a government, and the body is constituted and appointments are made in such a way as to advance a particular social purpose, it becomes possible for a subsequent government with different views to abolish or curtail the institution. This raises important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social purposes can be advanced through the legislation which a court is required to interpret. Judges do not operate in a vacuum and in reality they do play a part in determining policy, including social policy. There is nothing objectionable in that. That is the way judges have always operated. If a court does take a direction that is at odds with the government of the day, and the body is small and specialised, there is a greater possibility for the court to be abolished or curtailed. In any event, it is inappropriate that a judicial body be structured in such a way that its membership or its operation should advance a particular social purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to specialist courts generally, the objection is that they develop a limited range of expertise and they tend to have input from a limited range of persons. Because of their constant association with that small range of persons and that limited range of subjects, they develop a limited outlook that a court of broader jurisdiction does not suffer from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns expressed by the Law Council of Australia underscore the need for the government to explain why the court is being established. In the absence of such an explanation, it would be irresponsible to support a bill that in effect abolishes a significant part of a superior federal court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a more pragmatic level, an explanation is needed to justify the cost of establishing this new court. In this area, there is also no explanation from the government. The financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum to the bill states that the resource implications of establishing the Industrial Relations Court `have not yet been fully assessed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement proposes that the Industrial Relations Court share registry and other facilities of the Federal Court wherever possible. The proposed statutory provisions setting up the bill would appear, however, to contemplate a separate administrative structure. The bill provides mechanisms for the appointment of judicial registrars, and an administrative registrar is to be appointed to assist the chief justice in relation to the administrative affairs of the court. Other officers are to be appointed, including district registrars of the court for each registry, and sheriffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are annual requirements for the chief justice to prepare management and financial accounts which are to be scrutinised and audited by the Auditor-General. The proposals authorise the Federal Court of Australia to undertake receipt of documents, issuing of writs and some other administrative functions on behalf of the Industrial Relations Court, as well as the duplication of some appointments. However, there is no guarantee that the court would be established utilising the benefit of any of these economies. Given the other independent administrative and reporting requirements of the Industrial Relations Court, it is difficult to see how the court could be set up without significant expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition opposes the bill generally and, for the particular reasons that I have outlined, the coalition opposes the particular parts of the bill which seek to establish the Industrial Relations Court of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Industrial Relations Reform Bill and cognate bill that have been brought into this place by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). It is legislation that, in its broadest sense, attempts to engender greater flexibility in the industrial relations system while providing the basic underpinning of the award system to ensure that lowly paid workers are adequately protected. I commend the minister for his efforts in bringing this legislation to the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is indeed a complex area of our economic system. There are many competing interests and parties whose views have to be taken into account. But I think that, in this legislation, we have a framework for the ongoing development of the industrial relations system in this country in a most progressive and gradual way. This legislation gives effect to the mandate that the government achieved at the last election on this issue. The Australian people, throughout the election campaign and in the debates that took place across the length and breadth of my state of Victoria and the nation generally, were left in no doubt as to the positions being enunciated by the government and by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, in my seat of Corio&mdash;and I have made this point before in the House&mdash;I campaigned very strongly on this issue and my majority went up by some 3 per cent. Across the length and breadth of Victoria, the government picked up many seats. I think it was due in part not only to the issue of the GST, but to the way in which workers perceived their interests and how those interests would be served by either a coalition government or a Labor government being returned to power. I think many of them, having lived through the Victorian experience, are quite glad that they returned a federal Labor government to power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations is one of those key issues where the differences between the coalition and the government are quite pronounced; they are quite easily defined. The Labor Party in government has been a party of gradual and reasonable reform. It is this aspect of gradualism, in a very sensitive economic area, that has provided Australia with the essential stability that it has needed to cope with the industrial and structural changes that have occurred at a breakneck pace in the Australian economy. The heart and the basis of our considerations over that decade in power has been the notion that we would deliver to the Australian work force fairness and equity in the industrial relations system, and in the outputs from the economic system in terms of wages and salaries that are paid. It is a policy that has been pursued and developed with a degree of compassion which I think sits relatively uneasily, not with all members on the other side of the House but certainly with that right wing reactionary cabal that has gained control of the Liberal Party apparatus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, what the jobsback program&mdash;which was put to the Australian people by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the coalition parties&mdash;sought to do was to provide a market driven industrial relations system which offered little or no protection to the lowly paid in this community and which was soundly rejected by the Australian people when they went to the polls on 13 March. If we want to look at, weigh up and balance which political party in this House has achieved in the area of industrial relations, I think honourable members opposite would have to concede that the Labor Party in government has delivered a period of unparalleled stability in the area of industrial relations in Australia. Our period in office has been typified by low levels of industrial disputation and a high degree of cooperation between labour and capital, the owners and the managers and the workers at the coalface in enterprises throughout the length and breadth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has brought increased productivity due to the low level of industrial disputation. I do not think that is a situation that is acknowledged enough by economists. Where the economy is based on cooperation and progress in the workplace and good relationships in the workplace and, through that, achieving low levels of industrial disputation, that spills over, in an economic sense, very much to the advantage of the economic system generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a period of gradual cultural change&mdash;dramatic cultural change, but gradual cultural change, nonetheless&mdash;at the workplace level. That has been achieved under the framework of the accord which has delivered to the Australian economic system predictable wage increases and low levels of industrial disputation over the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation contrasts starkly with what occurred at the time of the last coalition government. I have not read anything in the debates that have since taken place in this House that would cause me to change my mind that the coalition really does not have a grip on the realities in this particular area of industrial and economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last period of coalition rule in this country was typified by industrial disruption and record numbers of working days lost which, in economic terms, meant reduced productivity in the economy and a situation in which everyone was worse off. It is not a very good economic point for the coalition to argue that greater flexibility will provide the Australian economy with all the wonderful benefits outlined in its jobsback policy. Without taking into account the dark side of the moon or the other side of the coin, the coalition's policy is a recipe for greater industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate many honourable members have canvassed the technical aspects of this legislation. I do not intend to go into those aspects here. Rather, I want to canvass the ethical basis that should underpin our attitudes to this most important issue, which is of great moment to the working people of this nation. Labour has an essential dignity that ought to be understood and taken into account in any economic deliberations on this issue. An individual through his or her work accumulates and develops basic skills. Social relationships are developed and enhanced in the workplace and through work. A person through his or her work realises individual potential and develops it further. The workplace itself sets a structural setting for the attainment of stated career goals for working people. The nation's workplaces are where workers are confronted each day with the great value choices and decisions where tolerance of difference must be the order of the day&mdash;tolerance of diversity and racial tolerance must be engendered in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If opposition members had gone through workplaces throughout the length and breadth of Victoria&mdash;as I have, working for the former industry minister, John Button&mdash;and some of the workplaces in Geelong, they would see just how dehumanising those places can be. They are noisy. Occupational health and safety considerations are not paramount in the minds of employers and rather poisoned relationships exist between the workers and their management and the owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to really understand the ethical basis upon which all legislation in this area must grow. I would like to reflect with honourable members on a document produced by the Catholic Bishops Committee for Industrial Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industrial relations: the guiding principles</EMPHASIS>. It canvasses such issues as the nature of work, the right to rest, the freedom of association, the right to withdraw one's labour, the influence of bodies external to the direct employment relationship; and touches on workplace reform. There is much in that rather simple but powerful document to commend. For the benefit of honourable members, I want to go to the section on the nature of work. The Catholic bishops said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is a natural priority of labour over capital. Simply expressed, work exists for the person, not the person for the work. It follows that human work cannot be treated as a resource or as a commodity to be traded in like any other commodity.</PARA>
<PARA>And they were quoted as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . the danger of treating workers as a special kind of merchandise or as an impersonal force needed for production . . . always exists especially when the whole way of looking at the question of economics is marked by the premises of materialistic economism".</PARA>
<PARA>I challenge opposition members: does the jobsback policy that the coalition put before the Australian electorate at the last election really put labour before capital? As I reflect on the legislation introduced by the Minister for Industrial Relations, underpinning that legislation is a real concern for the dignity of labour, a real attempt to put labour before capital and to treat labour not just as an economic commodity to be bandied about in the marketplace and to be subject to the imperatives of the marketplace&mdash;a real concern to put labour in a pre-eminent position in the legislation. The Catholic bishops comment on the section `The right to rest' as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Respect for human dignity requires that working conditions, including the length of shifts and the length of a week's work, be such as to protect the health and well-being of workers and to recognise their obligations to their family and the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing that the honourable member for Bennelong said during the campaign caused me to reflect that he understands that working people have a right to rest, a right to a day off and a right to recreational and social input to their communities. Under the section headed `The influence of bodies external to the direct employment relationship', the Catholic bishops commented as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his visit to Australia in 1986, Pope John Paul II said "Australia has a long and proud tradition of settling industrial disputes and promoting co-operation by its almost unique system of arbitration and conciliation. Over the years this system has helped to defend the rights of workers and promote their well-being, while at the same time taking into account the needs and the future of the whole community".</PARA>
<PARA>That is essentially the position that the government has attempted to take. While recognising the need to progress and reform this particular area, it has attempted to retain the structure of conciliation and arbitration in this country to give a real role to the legal framework in protecting the rights and conditions of those lowly workers in our society. In the section headed `Workplace reform', the Catholic bishops said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a particular need to protect the well-being of those in the working community whose educational qualifications and level of skills place them in a vulnerable position. Care should be taken to ensure that they receive appropriate protection and are given, so far as it is possible, opportunities to improve their prospects, and "realise their humanity more fully in every respect" . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to say that underpinning the government's legislation and its quest for reform in this area is a desire to protect the lower paid workers in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's position on this issue is fatally flawed in an economic sense. I should like to canvass some of the arguments that the coalition advanced in support of its position. Reading some of the debates, one would come to the rather simplistic conclusion that the only factor that has caused Australia's unemployment problem over the past decade has been the centralised wage fixing system. Labour is a unique factor of production; it operates in the medium of the marketplace but, as I have described, it really stands above it. The Liberal Party's policy in jobsback, which the opposition articulated again in this debate, is really the low road option for growth and economic recovery. It is a low wage, low productivity, poor performance outcome for the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at Australia's economic problems&mdash;and the key economic problem at the moment is unemployment&mdash;and if we really want to take a cool analysis of its causes, there is a multitude of causes that are of far greater import than the centralised wage fixing system and the level of wages that the Australian work force has been granted over the past decade. One very important cause of unemployment has been the reduction in overseas demand for Australian goods and services as comparable economies, such as Japan, the United States, and Europe, have slipped into recession. We have seen a reduced demand for our key commodities and a reduced price received for those commodities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite from rural communities would know that, when the price that is obtained for rural commodities declines to the extent that some of them have, that really dries up the purchasing power of the farming community and has a dramatic impact on regional economies and employment in those economies. Accompanying that reduced level of international demand have been low levels of domestic demand, and we have seen significant unemployment created by the rapid pace of technological change and structural change in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody in this House would seriously argue that Australia should not enter the technological race and that it should not restructure its economy as we have done over the past 10 years. A dramatic reconstruction has taken place. However, to simply say that the total unemployment in this country is a result of a centralised wage fixing system is economic nonsense. It is a simplistic analysis that ought to be rejected, but it seems to form the base premise on which the coalition mounts its argument for the industrial relations system that it put to the Australian people and that it puts again in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention the women of Australia and their position in the work force under jobsback and the coalition's industrial relations proposals. Women in the Corio electorate were the staunchest opponents of the opposition's proposal, and they had good reason. The award system has brought to the women of Corio good working conditions that they are very keen to protect. The award system has been responsible for the thrust to equal pay for women in the electorate, and it has reduced the disparities between male and female wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simply put, the award system which now underpins the government's thrust in industrial relations has provided a measure of protection for women. There has been a concern by the women of Corio at the drift towards the loss of conditions by the conservatives' concept of enterprise bargaining, and during the campaign they gave substantial support to my candidacy. We can debate in this House to great length the technical aspects of this legislation, but I would say to honourable members opposite that, when they look closely at the ethical considerations and the ethical underpinning of their position, they really do not match up in any respect. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Industrial Relations Reform Bill will go down in history as legislation which is like much else that has come from this particular government over time. It will be found to be very debilitating for Australia&mdash;for the nation, for the economy, and of course for the people who live and work in it. The government would argue that it is all done in the interests particularly of workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to honourable members&mdash;as Jennie George of the ACTU said&mdash;that the unions won the election and the employers lost, and the unions are now seeking their pound of flesh by protecting the bureaucracy that they operate. This is the ACTU bureaucracy protection bill. It does all the things that the ACTU wants, but not necessarily in the interests of workers, most of whom&mdash;particularly in the private sector&mdash;have demonstrated that they no longer trust or need a union. People are refusing to pay their dues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become very obvious in recent times that the main source of finance for unions comes from the public sector, and it comes from governments which collect that money for trade unions. Considering the number of governments that now are not of the unions' political persuasion, one might wonder why they go on doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria Mr Kennett stopped it. Events in Victoria give us a clear idea of the extent to which people in the public sector really want to be members of unions. One school teachers' union had to sack 23 staff because of the fact that once people had a choice&mdash;which one might argue they had before, but clearly they did not&mdash;they would not pay their union dues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also see articles in the paper stating that the main public sector union in Victoria is contemplating selling its building. In other words, it does not have the money any more because the money has no longer been forcibly extracted from people who suddenly find, under the Kennett government, that they have a choice. People do not want to pay the money; they would rather spend it on their children or their families, and this choice has been granted to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this bill is designed to protect the union bureaucracy. It is structured around a fear campaign, and we saw this in the last election. The government says that this bill sets out to achieve a number of objectives, and paramount amongst these objectives is that it wants to protect the workers. I think that is worthy of some consideration in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us start with the argument that the award system has protected workers for years. Generally, because of the natural law-abiding nature of Australian employers, it has. A law was made and Australian employers have complied with the law. Suddenly we get a situation where we are told that if that law is changed in any way people will be subject to exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not have to go very far into the courts and into the industrial tribunals of this land to get a massive record of the people who have been exploited under the existing award system. In other words, irrespective of that law, there are people who, either through lack of knowledge or through straight dishonesty, will try to pay wages or apply conditions that are less than the award. By a process they are discovered&mdash;maybe through the complaint of a worker or by other means&mdash;and they find themselves before a court of the land. They might appear before an industrial tribunal, they are duly fined and obliged to pay back the money that they owe to that worker, and the worker is reinstated on proper working conditions. It is not the award system that does that; it is, firstly, the law-abiding nature of most employers and, secondly, it is the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last election we were told that if we walked away from that system&mdash;which has never prevented exploitation, it has only contained it&mdash;we would immediately get total exploitation of the work force. It was said that we were going to write a new set of rules called enterprise agreements&mdash;as Mr Kennett has done in Victoria&mdash;but there would be no protection for workers. We were told that the proposition would be, `Take the contract or take the sack'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 October 1993 in Victoria under the new Kennett legislation there was a landmark case. The unions claimed it as some sort of great victory. Considering their rhetoric during the campaign, politically at least for them it was a loss. The headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;so this news was published all around Australia&mdash;reads `Court rules woman's work contract void'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A woman who said she was forced to sign a work contract that cut her wages and conditions had the contract overturned by Melbourne Magistrate's Court yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, under the new Kennett legislation workers have exactly the same protection in the courts as they had under the award system. What had the employer done to her? It is reported here:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The union had been unable to get hold of the contract Henry signed,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Karen Henry was her name&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but had discovered it cut her hourly pay rate from more than $9 to $8.55.</PARA>
<PARA>She was not actually sent barefoot into the workplace to work 55 hours a week or 100 hours a week. She had a cut of about 65c an hour in her pay, and I am not condoning that. But irrespective of that, the court said that she had been forced to sign this contract. The court accepted her evidence and it obliged her employer to go back to the old arrangement. So what is different, except that there is now the opportunity for various small businesses to make these arrangements in a fair and proper way&mdash;as the Victorian law provides, as the Western Australian law provides, as the New South Wales law provides&mdash;and in a manner by which people are protected. It lays down minimums and other requirements and, particularly, as all of those laws provide, an employee cannot be forced, by threat of the sack, to take the contract. Here is evidence of the court so providing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In support of the argument of the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) a minute ago, the decision was made in probably the easiest court for anybody to attend&mdash;the Melbourne Magistrate's Court, or a magistrate's court. A decision was made in a court which lacks complexity. It was a rather interesting thing. I would like to cite a few of the other things&mdash;notwithstanding claims in here that nobody is going into the Kennett rules and that they are all bolting for the federal arena. Ms Casey, the union representative, told the court that about a third of the union's 17,000 Victorian members had signed work contracts since March when the Victorian government scrapped state awards. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Employee Relations Act was a disaster for workers in the catering industry, forcing many to sign contracts that offered poverty wages.</PARA>
<PARA>But here she was with her landmark case in the courts arguing about 65c an hour. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The union thinks the case is very significant because what the court has said is that you cannot be bullied into signing an employment contract.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Casey, the union person, said that. That is what we said all along. We said our style of employment contracts would protect workers and give them protection in the court. It has been proved already. In other words, it shows up the outrageous claims of those people who said, to the contrary, that employees would be forced to take the contract or take the sack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might wonder why workers cannot be protected by one means or the other. One might wonder what is so special about the award system. There are thousands of cases where the award system did not protect people, where they were exploited in exactly the same fashion and where, on a similar number of occasions, people were brought before the courts to answer on that matter. So it is absolute rubbish that this sort of argument can be brought forward, as it was in the second reading speech and in other parts of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, as shadow minister for small business, also want to raise another matter about this particular legislation. Considering its complexity, I should be given a couple of hours; I do not have them. I want to draw to the attention of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) and of the government the complex procedures that they are proposing, particularly in relation to the requirements for an employer who wishes to have an enterprise agreement with his staff of, probably, one. We must remember that there are nearly 300,000 employers in Australia who employ fewer than 10 people each. I guess probably 200,000 of them employ fewer than three people each. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An employer has a staff of one and wants to have an enterprise deal. This legislation requires the employer to first ring up the union. The employer is not in the union and the staff is not in the union. I have employed thousands of people who did not want to be in the union and rejected that request when it was put to them directly by a union representative. The employer has to contact the union before negotiations are started. That will rule out 90 per cent of businesses. Employers will not invite unions to come around into their businesses, so they will not do anything about it. Then, if employers get that far and actually get their agreement in place, they have to have it registered with the Industrial Relations Commission. They run the risk of being dragged in there to prove why they should have that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imagine the bloke running the corner deli or the small supermarket contemplating those sorts of requirements. He will not. He will just tear them up in the first instance. But compare that with his very large competitors. We all know how, for instance, the retail grocery business works today. We have some very efficient small business operatives who work through the cooperative wholesaling groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the giants&mdash;the Coles and the Woolworths in particular. This legislation does not represent much of a problem for Coles and Woolworths. They have their own IR departments, now called the human resources departments. They can deal with all of their workers on one basis and have one negotiation. It is probably convenient for them to deal through a union, rather than going to see Bill Brown and Tom Smith. They get the agreement all together. They are unionised anyway. If the agreement gets to the court, so what? The human resources manager goes and deals with that. Big business will get their enterprise agreements; little business will not. This is at a time when&mdash;whether we like it or not; whether we approve of it or not&mdash;food retailing and other forms of retailing are going seven days and, on many occasions, 24 hours a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So how does the little guy compete with the big guy? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) might like to tell us how. He stuck with the old-fashioned award, which nobody is going to amend any more and it is going to slip away. </PARA>

He is going to be stuck with an archaic award because it is behind us, basically. The award is still there; it is the safety net. But he has not got the resources to go and do what his big competitor is doing, and he is in trouble. This is very anti-small business legislation, at a point in time when the government is pleading with small business to go out and employ people. Let me remind the parliament that, even in these tough times, industry employers have a solution: they do not employ people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quite accept the terms on justice. I can see that a woman, for instance, who is about to have a baby should not lose her job. She should have the opportunity to go out, have her baby and stay away from work. That is fine. In a workplace of eight or 10 people it is probably not a problem. But what if a person is an employer of one? The employer has an obligation under this legislation to re-employ that person when that person comes back and says, `Junior is old enough now to be in the hands of a day care centre. Can I have my job back?'. But that employer has employed somebody else during that period because that employer only has a staff of one. If we look to the other section of the act we find that the employer cannot sack the other employee. That person has done nothing wrong. What reason, as laid down in this act, could an employer give that person, or the union, or the CES for putting that person off? What does the employer do? The two employees are both good workers. I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about successful businessmen, it is time that we recognise some of the problems that are associated with this sort of legislation for those who employ very small numbers of people and who would like to comply with the law. They do not want to break it. They do not want to do deals behind anyone's back. They are honest people trying to do the right thing, and they have no choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke to an electrician the other day; he is doing a job for us. He said, `The only reason I am surviving, Wilson, is that I have had a good business for years; but I don't  employ anybody'. He just does not give anybody a job. He would like to. He is capable. He is a good man. His price to me was 50 per cent lower compared to another fellow who employs five people. He got the job. I do not know what the other bloke's workers did in the last couple of days. Maybe they got a job elsewhere. But this guy will not employ anybody; and, of course, he is knocking the spots off the poor devil who decides to do so. It is silly because it does not particularly help anybody. But more importantly, people are rejecting employing people simply because of the hassles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want people to get jobs; we want people to be employed. I drew this to the minister's attention the other day, and I will touch on it only briefly. We prevent people from getting a job after 4 o'clock in this country. I heard the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) say, `Everybody's got to have their weekends off'. A lot of those who have to have their weekends off also have to have Monday to Friday off. There are no jobs for them because we lock all our factories up on Saturday and Sunday. We do not let anybody in on Saturday and Sunday; notwithstanding they have machinery and high-tech equipment that they could be using. Furthermore, we do this between 4 o'clock and midnight every day of the week. We do this in our retail areas. Just when tourists are wanting to go out and spend their hard currency that we have attracted them here to spend, we lock all the shops because that is the simple solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were so many matters I wanted to touch on. I have not yet touched on sections 45D and 45E, but I know many other speakers have. The removal of those sections from the Trade Practices Act is outrageous. The point is made that we do not need this industrial relations court. As the honourable member for Tangney has said, we do not need a new court bureaucracy. I have just proved to honourable members how fair and honest the magistrate's court can be in Melbourne, and it is fair and honest to both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the subject of redundancy. As an employer, I frequently have people who walk up to me and sack me because they have a better opportunity. They leave in harmony. They are not upset with anything that I have done to them; they just happen to have gone and got a better job and I wish them well. Why can I not have some redundancy? I have usually got a substantial investment in these people. I have trained them and done all sorts of things. I do not want them to go. But nobody says that the small business employer should get some refund. Let us be fair about it. If it is reasonable for an employer to tell someone, `Look, I lack the resources to continue employing you and you have got to go', and he or she says, `Sell your house because you need to pay me as I have been a loyal employee', the reverse should apply. In the interests of fairness, one might wonder why it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The withdrawal of sections 45D and 45E is just an invitation for all the dreadful things that used to happen to happen again. We are talking about black bans&mdash;the right of a totally unrelated work force, a totally unrelated union, to close down a business. I have seen cases where that has been done. A union boss has gone into the workplace and could not get the truckies involved to strike. That union boss has then gone down to the bulk handling authority on the wharf and got the workers there to black ban that fellow's trucks. The men that were driving the trucks did not want to go on strike. He put them out of work with a black ban. That has happened with the law as it is. Suddenly we are going to make that twice as easy to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first time in Australia's history that a strike will be legal in the law&mdash;industrial action, as we call it&mdash;under section 170. The legislation talks of the commission ordering a secret ballot. Imagine ordering a secret ballot. Quite clearly, this law should provide for secret ballots. If a strike is to be held, it can be authorised only  by a secret ballot. I am pleased to be informed by our shadow minister today that we will put forward an amendment to say that, where this legal industrial action is permitted, it can be authorised only by a vote&mdash;and a secret ballot at that. Of course, it must be carried by a majority of the workers&mdash;not this business of the industrial action being approved by a majority of the valid votes cast in the ballot, meaning that if 20 people vote they can put 1,000 people out. If 1,000 people are involved, 501 have got to vote for the strike. I would like anybody in this House to say why that is not Australian&mdash;why we should not have proper secret ballots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told in the legislation about the complexity of a secret ballot. In that situation, the payroll becomes the electoral roll. There is no complexity. If those opposite want to have a simple strike system, they can put in the legislation that the industrial action is for a period of two days, five days or whatever. There is not even the need for a vote for the workers to come back, although they can have a vote to continue the strike. All of those things can be resolved. It is totally Australian to have secret ballots. It is as arguable to say that we do not need them in industrial situations as it is to say we do not need them in elections. Would it not be nice if we elected governments by all turning up on a street corner and saying, `We put up our hands for Wilson Tuckey or Garry Nehl' or somebody else?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the course of this debate members of the opposition have wandered wide and far over a whole host of matters which involve the nature of industrial society and the role of people within it. I intend to go back somewhat in history and have a look at the background of the industrial society, the nature of the society we are now living in and the reasons why this sort of legislation is essential. In the introduction to his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tools of Change&mdash;New technology and democratisation of work</EMPHASIS>, John Matthews writes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secret is out! Work need no longer be performed in conditions of anger, frustration and alienation. Jobs need no longer be fragmented into meaningless, boring and repetitive tasks. Workers need no longer be treated as mere appendages of machines&mdash;even in cases where the machines are gleaming new, and come equipped with visual display units. Work no longer need be paced, measured, supervised and planned to the point where people feel they have lost any sense of independence of control&mdash;and hence dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conventional wisdom had it that alienating work was the price to be paid for our material prosperity. Our levels of productivity, we were told, depend on mechanisation and division of labour, and increasingly on labour-displacing automation. We may not have liked it, but we enjoyed the consumer benefits&mdash;and so we had to put up with it. Hierarchies of authority were built into the very process of production because, we were led to believe, hierarchies are the most efficient mechanism for achieving social co-ordination and control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But a new world of work is emerging. Competitive pressures and technological innovation are now triggering changes that could have far reaching implications. Behind closed gates and doors, an unprecedented level of restructuring is in train. Fundamental changes to work organisation and industrial relations are being contemplated. The old verities are being questioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the change is simple, yet complex. Mass production is reaching the limits of its technical and hence economic, efficiency. Markets for mass consumer goods have become saturated; competitive pressures induced by newly industrialised nations in South East Asia and South America are becoming acute; and demand is being expressed in specialised market niches. Quality rather than quantity is increasingly the road to profitability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This shift is having impressive consequences. It is creating a new requirement for `value added' management techniques, and for a flexible, skilled and responsible workforce which is able to exploit the productive gains available with computer-integrated production systems. This in turn is inducing firms to abandon their obsessions with fragmented jobs and lower skill levels. The drive for greater management control, through centralisation and automation, is giving way to a drive for competitive survival&mdash;if possible, on the basis of a co-operative relationship between management and workforce. A new industrial culture, in both West and East, is emerging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This revolution in the mode of production is not yet established. It is not even widely known, if you judge by standard press reports which still see work as an object of boredom or amusement. But the truth is, that work is about to undergo its greatest change since the Industrial Revolution. And the role of the organised labour movement in this process will be central.</PARA>
<PARA>The legislation now before the House recognises those fundamental changes&mdash;the change from the Industrial Revolution and craft unions&mdash;and puts into place a new system which will bring workers and employers together to establish a democratisation of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Craft unions, of course, emerged from the pre-Industrial Revolution. Then the majority of people lived in rural villages and agricultural labour, on their own land or others' land, occupied most of their time. Work was organised largely in family units. The pinnacle of this system was the proud and highly skilled master craftsman who, owning his own tools, hired his assistants, bought his own materials and sold his product direct to the market. Technologies and production processes were relatively stable and were known in minute detail by the independent artisan through his apprenticeship and admission to the guild. The independent and highly skilled artisan was forced to give way to the modern system of factory production, a period of not only enormous industrial change but also social upheaval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The factory was created in a climate of great social violence. Independent workers would rather starve than submit to its discipline. Riots and arson frequently accompanied a new factory's appearance. So hated were the factories that early owners were largely dependent upon orphan children for their work force or on the inmates of workhouses. Starving agricultural labourers, turned off the land as a result of the enclosure movement, were also early factory fodder stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of the opposition to them, factories became entrenched, and eventually skilled workers had to submit to their discipline. The point is that this was not through technical superiority but through an organisation of labour imposed as a social choice by the employers and reinforced by economic benefit. The important economic stimulus for employers to establish manufactories was the possibility of extending divisional labour. This would break a single craft production process into a number of detailed jobs, many of which could be performed by unskilled workers, and hence more cheaply. This factor was studiously avoided by Adam Smith in his famous discussion of the division of labour in his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Wealth of Nations</EMPHASIS> in 1776. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, before dinner I was pointing out that Adam Smith, in his work of 1776, had not noted the distinction between an artist and craftsman and a detail worker in factories, but this was noted by Charles Babbage in 1832 in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economy of Machinery and Manufactures</EMPHASIS>. Babbage pointed out:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The master manufacturer, by dividing the work to be executed into different processes, each requiring different degrees of skill or of force, can purchase exactly that precise quantity of both which is necessary for each process; whereas, if the whole work were executed by one workman, that person must possess sufficient skill to perform the most difficult, and sufficient strength to execute the most laborious, of the operations into which the art is divided.</PARA>
<PARA>The other major economic benefit that factory production brought to employers was the more obvious one of allowing them to dictate longer hours of work. This did not necessarily increase productivity&mdash;indeed, it probably lowered it as the workers' fatigue became overwhelming&mdash;but it allowed fit men to be worked more intensively, thereby lowering unit costs. Economically, there was no limit to the optimal working time, and employers would have had workers at the mill for 24 hours a shift if it were humanly possible. The only preventative to a total collapse of civilised values was legal regulation of the length of the working day. Of course, that was the source of great agitation for factory regulation during the first half of the 19th century. As the individual craftsman was forced to compete with unskilled labour in the factory system, the craft guilds merged into craft unions, and the organisation of labour became a fundamental system within the industrial society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mechanisation has been the principal source of technological change in the workplace over the past century, taking over former craft areas one by one. By the way in which it was introduced, its effect was to de-skill formerly skilled craftsmen and to offer factory owners greater control over their employees, or `hands' as they were called. Much of the history of Industrial Revolution society concerns the conflict between capital and labour as each sought to gain advantage in an ever-competitive world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the 19th century, the impetus towards mass production gained ground over its craft production technological rival. Its basic rationale was the reduction of cost by standardising the production of parts, and the use of repetitive and mechanical methods to substitute for skilled labour. The victory of mass production was complete when Henry Ford introduced the modern assembly line at his vehicle plant in Hyland Park, Detroit, in 1913. It was the first time that an endless chain conveyor had been used in vehicle production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite conventional claims that it was the technological superiority of the assembly line that led to its introduction, the engineering of the line was, in fact, quite primitive. In reality, its essence lay in control&mdash;in particular, control over the pace of production. Instead of a situation where the worker goes to the job, with the assembly line the job comes to the worker at a pace dictated by the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with other innovations in the organisation of work, the assembly line was introduced under conditions of social violence and worker resistance. Workers reacted to the assembly line by leaving in droves, and Ford found recruitment a big problem. In 1913, labour turnover was 380 per cent. In 1914, the International Workers of the World, which we now know as the Wobblies, began an intensive unionisation drive in Ford plants. Ford's response to the double threat of losing vital workers and dealing with unionisation was the announcement of a new wage level of $5 a day&mdash;which, in 1914, was nearly double the standard rate. That was a brilliant move which solved both problems at a stroke and gave Ford a satisfied work force on which to impose further job intensification. As Ford wrote in his autobiography:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The payment of $5 a day for an 8-hour day was one of the finest cost-cutting moves we ever made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assembly line became the dominant practice even outside manufacturing. For example, in the meat trade, the solo practices of slaughtering and butchering were displaced around the turn of the century by the chain method of continuous disassembly of carcases. In some cases, the struggle to impose the chain method brought unions to the point of destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Henry Ford was quick to realise that the economies of scale inherent in mass production could only be reaped if mass markets could be created for mass produced goods. For this to be achieved, purchasing power had to be raised and maintained. That was one of the factors influencing Ford to introduce his $5 a day wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need from the 1920s onwards to create markets for mass produced goods underlies many of the social and economic developments that are conveniently seen as a rising interdependency. These include: Keynesian macro-economic policies and the New Deal, with their acknowledgment of government's role in holding up levels of domestic demand for mass produced goods; various forms of the welfare state; and acceptance of mass trade unions and collective bargaining as legitimate elements of the economic order. That was the consumption side of a comprehensive system of regulation that complemented the production side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened with interest in the course of the debate to members of the opposition expressing their support for the existence of unions. Yet, whilst members of the opposition argue that unions have a role to play, their policies have the opposite effect. Many opposition spokespeople in this debate have drawn attention to wages and wage levels, and they have suggested that employment would be created by a deregulation of the industrial system of this country. Such comments expose the ideology of the New Right and the absolute ignorance of the members of the opposition as to the relativity of wages and production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even worse, it perpetuates the myth that Australia is a high wage country. After a decade of falling real wages, we are not a high wage nation by developed country standards. According to a report to be released shortly by the New South Wales Office of Economic Development, Australian wages for skilled workers typical of a clever country are actually less than the more advanced of our Asian neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The office commissioned Employment Conditions Abroad Ltd to develop comparisons of salaries for five `generic' occupations. It demonstrated that wages in Sydney are cheaper than in, for example, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo and Hong Kong, whereas they are more expensive than in the cities of less developed nations&mdash;cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Bangkok and Manila. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development also supports the view that Australia is now a low wage cost country. For example, in 1991 the Australian compensation figure was 71 per cent of the US figure. However, when the figures are adjusted for exchange rate movements and changes in compensation rates, the Australian figure is down to 61 per cent of the US figure. Yet, despite the overwhelming evidence, the opposition still seems to be arguing that wages need to be further reduced and that the industrial relations system of this country should be the means by which this is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also heard in the debate that the high level of unemployment would fall if we were to change to a deregulated industrial system. Again, this is an argument related to wage levels. There seems to be an assumption on the part of the opposition that the lowering of wages would mean an automatic increase in employment. On a recent visit to Europe, as a member of a parliamentary delegation to European parliaments, I was briefed, along with other members, by the Directorate-General of Employment, Industrial Relations and Social Affairs of the Commission of the European Communities. We were also presented with a copy of its 1993 report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Employment in Europe</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition being put forward by opposition spokespeople is a demonstrated nonsense. For example, within the European Community, areas of highest unemployment are the areas of lowest wage levels. Portugal has the highest rate of unemployment and the lowest wage levels of European Community member nations. On the other hand, Germany, with much higher levels of wages, has the lowest rate of unemployment, despite the recent integration of East Germany. Thatcherism in the United Kingdom has resulted in the northern area of England being an area of low wages and high unemployment. In the south, higher wages have not resulted in the same level of unemployment. The report also supported the view that the on-cost of wages has no effect on the level of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As usual, the opposition is not factual in its approach to the problems facing Australia and is ignoring the real benefits currently enjoyed by Australia in being a low wage cost, high productivity country. It is about time the opposition stopped knocking Australia and started recognising the benefits we have as a nation and looking towards a solution to unemployment, not couched in ideology but based on research and facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The postwar period, with reconstruction in Europe and the boom triggered by the Korean War, set in train a period of growth unprecedented in the history of capitalism. All the elements of the mass production system worked together. Markets for consumer goods expanded as purchasing power grew and mass producing corporations supplied these markets with standardised goods, maintaining their competitiveness through technological supremacy and productivity growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Keynesian demand management techniques allowed consumer markets to maintain their buoyancy, diminishing the effects of the traditional business cycle of boom and slump, whilst new social security measures coped with the marginal elements in each society, preventing them from becoming too disruptive. But the saturation of domestic markets has radically undermined the concept behind mass production assembly lines. This is despite the frantic efforts of mass producers of consumer goods, who have resorted to such methods as aggressive marketing, advertising, building in obsolescence, and creating more stimulating new desires. There are only so many cars, television sets, washing machines or radios that people can absorb. By 1979, for example, in the United States there was one car for every two residents, and the road system had reached its absolute capacity. There just was not room in cities for more cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Market saturation was exacerbated by the rise of competing industrial powers on the periphery, who learned the mass production game and imitated it most effectively. Once a country uses mass production to its own advantage, as was done by the United States and then Europe, it forces other nations to do the same or lose their independence. This is the basic contradiction at the heart of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spread of mass production techniques and strategies only added to the glut of goods seeking an outlet in increasingly saturated markets. The saturation of world markets with consumption goods is part of the reason for high unemployment now spreading throughout the world. Manual workers are being replaced by technological innovation and robotisation of the mass assembly production lines is increasing at a rapid rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seeds of destruction of the kind of society that most of us knew in our youth began in 1913 with the introduction of the mass assembly line in Detroit.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a parliament and a nation, we need to work in conjunction with the union movement to introduce a more flexible approach to ensure that high skill and innovation bring rewards, whilst at the same time ensuring that the level of wages is not lowered to the extent that consumption is severely reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition tends to forget that production and consumption are interwoven. Production is profit to capital and capital requires the worker to spend wages in order to create profit. Henry Ford understood this basic equation as early as 1913. If we have learned nothing from looking at Thatcherite England, where deregulation of industrial relations and the unionised workplace has not improved the lot of workers or the profit of capital, we risk making the same mistakes in this country. The evidence is overwhelming. The basis of what the opposition puts has failed wherever it has been tried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will modernise the industrial relations system of this country and in the process recognise that non-union workers are entitled, and indeed should be encouraged, to enter into enterprise bargaining the same as the unionised sector of the work force.

The Industrial Relations Reform Bill is arguably the most important bill to come before this House during the current parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It started with the best intentions of introducing some genuine reform to Australia's industrial relations system, but what we have before the House is a bill which is repaying the union movement for its support of the Australian Labor Party at the March federal election. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) got himself completely hobbled and sidelined by the ACTU and produced what should be called the trade union payback bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when the rest of the world is moving forward to the next century, with more decentralised and flexible industrial relations systems allowing their industries to become far more competitive, far from delivering this, the Industrial Relations Reform Bill presently before the House reinforces the centralised rigidity of Australia's system and the power and control of the union movement. With this bill Australia will not be moving forward like the rest of the world; this nation will be going backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With unemployment in Australia currently at 11.2 per cent and only six per cent in the USA, this Labor government had a golden opportunity to address one of the major impediments to generating employment. But this government went weak, caved in to the ACTU, and now Martin and Bill are back in control&mdash;not Paul and John. I know that the rigid industrial relations system that we work under today is not the only cause of our unemployment problem. But, in drafting this legislation, the government had a golden opportunity to help alleviate that problem. </PARA>

It is yet another disincentive to employment. This Labor government must recognise that to have employees in employment there must be employers. We need more of them in this country in this day and age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as capital cannot exist without labour, labour cannot exist without capital. This government is supposedly looking seriously at removing impediments to regional development in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To enter into an enterprise agreement under this bill, employers and employees must go through a series of hoops. And they call this flexible! Firstly, the parties must establish respondency to a federal award. Secondly, parties must comply with the award system safety net&mdash;that is, a basic wage and award conditions. Thirdly, parties to the enterprise agreement must comply with the new legislated minimum standards based on International Labour Organisation conventions. How can an organisation based in Geneva have any idea of what conditions should apply or are relevant in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Taree or Port Macquarie?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixthly, the agreement must comply with the no disadvantage test. This means that any agreement made in regional Australia must not interfere with any existing award arrangements. There can be no flexibility and there can be no change, just ongoing centralised domination. That is the one very important area that has not been addressed in this legislation. We must have more flexibility in regional Australia. It has been recognised in the draft Industry Commission report that the cost of living, the impediments to development and the impediments to employment in regional Australia are totally different from those in the major capital cities. This has not been addressed in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seventh point is that unions which do not have members at a particular workplace but which are respondents to the relative federal award must be notified and given the opportunity to argue against the approval of the agreement by the Industrial Relations Commission.

As a result, their jobs would be saved. The union would not agree but, inevitably&mdash;and after much persuasion&mdash;the union was persuaded that it should be allowed. It was made to realise that the alternative was the loss of 60 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is the result of freeing up the system and making it more flexible, I cannot agree with it. As far as I am concerned, it is reinforcing centralised control of the system with the IRC and the unions. It is making the system more rigid and complicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eighth hurdle that employees and employers must get over in establishing a workplace agreement is that the Industrial Relations Commission must be satisfied that all employees to be covered by the agreement have been properly informed about it.

Even if an enterprise agreement meets all these criteria, it still can be knocked over by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.

<PARA>I will refer to that article again later. The aim of this government and this legislation is to broaden our agenda in terms of our international competitiveness, but we will not do this by abandoning the safety net for workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation aims to provide for a more  decentralised, innovative and effective system of industrial relations while strongly adhering to the principle of a safety net of minimum award conditions to protect those workers least able to protect their entitlements. The legislation has six main elements: new objects and a restructuring of the Industrial Relations Act 1988; maintenance of an award system and minimum entitlements to provide a safety net; more effective arrangements for enterprise bargaining&mdash;enterprise flexibility agreements and a sanction-free bargaining period in the negotiation of certified agreements; a more effective regime for regulating industrial action and enforcing agreements; the establishment of a specialist industrial relations court; and a restructuring of the National Labour Consultative Council and other institutional arrangements. Much has been made by members opposite of the consultations the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has had with our accord partner, the ACTU, during the development of these reforms. Why would the government not consult with the trade union movement on these and other matters? Let us remind ourselves of the achievements of the accords during the past 10 years. The level of industrial disputation in this country is 62 per cent lower than during the years of the Fraser government. The trade union movement has demonstrated its ability to respond to the economic difficulties facing this country during the 1980s and effectively cooperated with the government to hold wages down. The accord has provided for the restructuring of awards to allow for skills development and flexibility in workplace practices to improve productivity, maintenance of minimum award rates and the rationalisation of union structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ability of the trade union movement to adapt to the changing economic circumstances and to work effectively with the Labor government has been one of the great achievements of our economic restructuring in the past decade. It is quite possible that we would not have achieved as much without it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitment of the accord partners to enterprise bargaining has seen 1,200 enterprise agreements ratified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission since 1991. Now 37 per cent of workers under federal awards are covered by these agreements. The focus of the accord is to ensure wage increases are linked to productivity, to create new jobs, and to maintain an inflation rate in the same league as our trading partners, which is very important for our international trading position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the federal election on 13 March it was clear that electors were very concerned about the radical proposal of the coalition to destroy this harmonious working relationship between the accord partners. Industrial relations was the great sleeper of the campaign but crucial in the minds of many people, particularly in Victoria. It was also a significant issue for workers in the coalfields of the Bowen basin in Central Queensland, many of whom live and work in the electorate of Capricornia. I am delighted to welcome the shadow minister for resources, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) to the chamber. While it is true to say that many workers in this country are not active members of a trade union, they rely on the protection that awards give them to protect their situation. It is clear that many employers are very comfortable with the existing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my contribution to this debate I want to focus on the coal industry because it is central to the concerns of my electorate. The Minister for Industrial Relations, in his second reading speech, indicated that he will be considering the role of the Coal Industry Tribunal and its relationship with the Industrial Relations Commission. He has had consultations and sought submissions from various players in the industry. He has certainly received submissions from the United Mine Workers Union and the Australian Coalowners Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gippsland, the shadow minister for resources, spent some time in his speech during the second reading debate attacking the Coal Industry Tribunal and industrial relations in the coal industry. His comments need some rebuttal. I do not know how many coalminers or coal companies the honourable member for Gippsland represents, but his comments do a disservice to the industry and to what has been achieved by the Coal Industry Tribunal since its adoption in 1946. It is instructive to recall what the chief judge of the Federal Arbitration Court said in 1939&mdash;long before the shadow minister was born, I must add&mdash;about the industrial relations climate in the coal industry. He described it as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an unbridled and unregulated contest between employers and employees without restraint and actuated only by the rules of the jungle.</PARA>
<PARA>Although I can agree with the honourable member for Gippsland that the industry has undergone substantial changes from a domestic industry to our most significant commodity export earner, it is also true that the Coal Industry Tribunal has evolved its role to complement the necessary changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the late 1940s, the Coal Industry Tribunal was concerned to maintain supply, and this was indeed a function of the postwar reconstruction period. But in the decades that followed, the CIT was particularly concerned with production costs in determining wage outcomes. The cost of wages and salaries per tonne of saleable coal fell in the period 1956 to 1964 from $2.86 to $1.96. At the same time, wages of mineworkers did not keep pace with their counterparts in other industries in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the period 1965 to 1980, the coal industry expanded its levels of export and profitability&mdash;this is the period of the development on mining operations in central Queensland. In fact, in the submission of the United Mine Workers Union to the federal government, Romeyn has described the operation of the CIT as characterised by `productivity arbitration'. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tribunal's more particular (industry-specific) approach is evidenced by the emphasis placed upon the broad range of internal criteria including: <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> levels of coal production; the cost of production; the productivity of mineworkers;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the capacity of the industry to pay; markets and the availability of markets for coal; the availability of labour; and the peculiar circumstances, needs and difficulties of the coal mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA>So, far from being `the moribund, insulated and uncompetitive system of industrial relations' as described by the shadow minister for resources and energy, the CIT has been assisting the successful production of industry enterprise outcomes for 40 years. Comments by the shadow minister are remarkably similar to those of the ACA submission. For instance, the argument that the development of open-cut mining has changed the industry to be more like quarrying suggests that it is not mining. It is true that underground workers have, in the past, adopted this attitude towards open-cut mines. But, increasingly, mine production is integrated and mutually dependent, blending coal from both open-cut and underground sections of the same mine&mdash;as it certainly was in the two mines where I worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry to have to report that the two fatal mine accidents that occurred during my work with the Twin Creeks employee assistance program were both surface mine accidents. So any suggestion that the dangers of the industry are less in open-cut mining as opposed to underground mining certainly have not been endorsed from my experience. At a national level, half of the coalmining work force is employed underground and, increasingly, longwall mining technology is heralding a return to underground mining operations, especially in the Bowen Basin. In fact, what is happening at many of the mines that I am familiar with in the Bowen Basin is that underground mining is becoming the most efficient and preferred option as opposed to open-cut mining with a couple of notable exceptions&mdash;Curragh and Blair Athol, about which I will speak later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gippsland makes much of his comparisons on industrial disputation levels in the coal industry compared to other industries, but he does acknowledge the major achievement of the CIT and of all players in the industry in the significant reduction of working days lost per thousand employees since 1988. Indeed, the picture since the Coal Industry Tribunal was established confirms the value of the tribunal in minimising prolonged disputes. I point out that the long running housing dispute back in the late 1970s was an exception. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is well known and&mdash;dare I say&mdash;infamous in Blackwater, as I have said in this House. It reminds me of the very long memory of the coalmine workers. I suggest that their memories will extend far past the next election and the one after that. I dare say that they will continue to return Labor members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Factors contributing to the relatively low disputation levels include the active role played by the Coal Industry Tribunal, its prestige and authority with management and unions and its capacity to quickly sort out local disputes. There is support by the CIT of initiatives for industry specific solutions such as new work models and dispute procedures and the contribution of the CIT to education on these new initiatives. The United Mine Workers submission to the minister stresses:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The stability of the Tribunal and its ability to invoke change by productivity arbitration and by negotiation between the parties is the main reason for these much lower levels of disputation.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Gippsland went on in his speech to complain about the wage levels in the industry, as did the ACA in its submission to the government. The United Mine Workers submission points out that it is necessary to separate the continuous roster, overtime and geographically remote work force which are all full-time workers with other categories in other industrial sectors. If one compares the average, ordinary time weekly earnings of the coal industry employees with other members of the labour force, the differential is only 33 per cent. The ACA's submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . movements in coal industry earnings have also raced ahead of improvements in the industry's productivity levels . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It suggested that this was the fault of the CIT when, in fact, this was the outcome of mine site bonus arrangements; that is, enterprise specific arrangements negotiated between the parties. That component arbitrated by the CIT&mdash;that is, the award rate of pay&mdash;has decreased in real terms since 1987. It should be noted that coal managements should look back and see how they contributed to those mine site bonus arrangements in the late 1970s, early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Mine Workers agrees that continuing to improve our international competitiveness is important but points out that there are other factors to consider and other groups to contribute. It is important to have those groups&mdash;government, coal owners, coalmining unions, industrial relation groups and research organisations working together, not looking for blinkered industrial relations solutions which are so often the myopic stance of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to our international competitiveness, the ACA's submission states that our costs are higher than our competitors in South Africa and Indonesia. The United Mine Workers response to this is to ask, `How can integrating the CIT into the AIRC enable employers in the coal industry to pay workers $2 to $3 a day as is the current rate in Indonesia or have it arbitrate to impose "apartheid" solutions in the coal fields?'. I would certainly expect to see some industrial disruption in the industry if this were the case. This type of arrangement was what the opposition's wages policy was all about&mdash;flexibility downwards. Instead of cutting wages, our task is to improve productivity and the history of the industry is an impressive rise in annual output per employee, especially in the past decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we compare international best practice and productivity in Australia and Indonesia, we see some interesting results. The Blair Athol mine near Clermont in Central Queensland has 330 workers who produce 8.5 million tonnes per annum. Output per person is 25,700 tonnes. This compares very favourably with average productivity in the Australian industry of 6,330 tonnes per annum&mdash;obviously across a number of very different mining operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the average labour cost per tonne is not available for the Blair Athol mine, the average labour cost for Queensland coal is $9 per tonne. If we compare these figures with the Kaltim Prima mine in Indonesia, we find that eight million tonnes per annum are produced by 2,150 locals plus 130 expatriates with the output per person per year being 3,508 tonnes&mdash;remember that compares with 25,000 plus from the Blair Athol mine and they are both about as modern as each other. Average labour costs per tonne in Indonesia are $4.26. Per unit labour costs are lower but only because of the extremely low wages not because of better work practices. In fact, it is estimated that Australian mine workers are between two and seven times more productive than their Indonesian counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACIRL reported in its review of productivity that there have been several comparisons between Australian underground mines and the United States underground mines over many years. This survey could not validate the often heard claims for significantly better average hourly production for the USA. </PARA>
<PARA>I have cited that from the submission of the United Mine Workers. International competitiveness is one factor but others are quality of coal, reliability of supply and the existing supply and demand factors. Obviously, oversupply on the international market will keep coal prices low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments about the relevance of the CIT to the current industrial relations system needs careful consideration. Mainstreaming the coal industry into the AIRC will not be a panacea and could well remove the direct industry focus now available via the CIT. The coal industry is a clear leader in enterprise agreements with 45 per cent of employees covered by federal enterprise agreements, compared with 12 per cent of all other employees. A total of 22 per cent of all mine work places and 50 per cent of saleable coal production is covered by enterprise agreements&mdash;not a bad track record for the CIT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gippsland raised some concerns in his press release of 18 November&mdash;which I did not see in the national press but I was able to obtain a copy&mdash;about the legal protection from secondary boycotts. I am reliably advised that the Minister for Industrial Relations is introducing amendments which will cover his concerns. So, in this area of the very important coal industry, I believe we have seen that this is a very effective industrial relations program which has actually led the way for the current reforms that the minister is including in his bill. On this and other matters, in particular the protection of female workers, I believe that the reforms in the minister's bill will have very positive impacts on our workplaces and on our international competitiveness. </PARA>

The Prime Minister went down to Melbourne and he said, `We may have had a failure over the last decade, we may have mucked up our industrial relations but, trust me, it's all going to come good. I have my mate the Minister for Industrial Relations, tried and true and trusty, who's going to see this reform through'. When I heard that, for once in my life&mdash;and the minister should not scurry out of the chamber; he ought to stay to hear this&mdash;I thought the government had finally come to the conclusion in the national interest that one of the great reforms this country needed, even though it is not supported by the mates that contributed so much to it during the election campaign, was to do something to reform Australia's industrial relations system, and that it might for once take a position of principle and strength. </PARA>

But even that was too much for the lions of the ACTU, for he was cat whistled, booed and howled down, and he was given the message which has been the message for all industrial relations ministers of Labor governments, that is, `You don't control industrial relations, we do; the ACTU does'. </PARA>

These days, if one wants to come to an agreement in a particular enterprise or a particular company as to wages, conditions or those things that affect employment generally, even if the employer and the employees are in agreement, that is not enough. It is not enough that the people who are involved, the people who are at the workplace, come to an agreement; that is not enough.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of the matter is, as I have said a number of times in this parliament, that this opposition is the only major party in the Western world that still holds onto the Thatcherite-Reaganite philosophies which have been rejected throughout the world. Even conservative parties in other countries have decided to moderate their positions; they have decided they should realise there is something called social justice. Those words are totally foreign to the new right and to all of its spokesmen, including in particular the honourable member for Bennelong. The reality is that we are engaged here in a fundamental philosophical difference between ourselves and those opposite, and the fundamental philosophical difference is this&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Higgins had the impertinence to talk about equality. Can honourable members believe that&mdash;coming from the honourable member for Higgins? In fact, if the coalition had won the election and implemented its regime of industrial relations, we would have had a repetition throughout the whole of Australia of what we have had in Victoria&mdash;a situation where workers are impoverished and have a gun at their heads. They are threatened with dismissal; they are threatened with the sack. We have the situation in Victoria where the Liberal government promised the people that it would not dismiss public servants, but it came in and within six months sacked 32,000 people. Then we have the impertinence of the honourable member for Higgins coming in here and talking about equality. What has happened to those people and the livelihood of those people? What has happened to the situation of those people?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have none of this nonsense which parades under the banner of enterprise bargaining. What does it really mean? It really means the freedom to do what? It means the freedom for an employer to put a gun at the head of an employee and to say, `Right, either you work for $3 an hour or you are not needed; we will get the next fellow', because there is a lot of unemployment. As is well known throughout the whole of economic history, when there is a lot of unemployment the power of the employer dramatically increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So under these circumstances can honourable members believe that the opposition is suggesting that we should do away with the safety net, a protection for workers, and that we should put in place a regime of enterprise bargaining where we will have not a genuine discussion between equals&mdash;an equal employer and an equal employee&mdash;but a discussion which is more like a man putting a gun at an employee's head and saying, `Right, you will work for $3 an hour or you are out.'? Should anyone think that $3 is an exaggeration, it is certainly not. That was the figure suggested by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) as the youth wage. He was going to have young people in this country working for $3 an hour. He was going to suggest that if they were not prepared to work for that amount they should not even get unemployment benefits. This is the sort of regime which is brought up by the opposition's new right philosophies; yet honourable members opposite have the impertinence to come in here and try to claim the high moral ground. What a nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that we recognised that no party will be elected in Australia unless it starts making some commitments to social justice. Some people in the opposition recognise that; unfortunately, they are not the majority, they are not influential. Influential members such as the honourable member for Higgins and the honourable member for Bennelong are running the opposition agenda in these matters. They are trying to put in place policies that have been discredited throughout the Western world, especially in Britain and the United States. Thatcherism has been discredited even by Thatcher's own party. Yet we find Thatcherism being put up here as a philosophy by the Australian Liberal Party. No wonder people say that if Robert Menzies were alive today he would not recognise the Liberal Party. It has moved so far to the right that it has lost any sense of commitment to welfare or to social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this bill is about. It is about a commitment to social justice because it is a commitment to a minimum wage. What is wrong with a minimum wage? The honourable member for Bennelong objects to a minimum wage. What does he want? He wants a situation where we can have negotiations between an employer and an employee with the employer saying, `Listen, this minimum wage is a bit too high for me; I can't afford this, so out you will go. You will have to work for much less than this, otherwise you are out'. That is the sort of industrial relations approach which is advocated by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of the minimum wage, as the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) said in his second reading speech, is a fundamental issue in Australia. Australia was one of the first countries in the world to introduce the minimum wage. Indeed, Alfred Deakin, who used to be part of the Liberal tradition&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Howard" NAMEID="ZD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was when we had a high living standard. Remember that? You would not remember that.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bennelong says it was when we had high living standards. I will come to that point because this is really the crux of the matter. The honourable member for Bennelong is speaking about reducing the living standards of Australians. That is the fundamental point which he just admitted in his own comment. He wants to reduce the living standards of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that, yes, Deakin wanted to have high living standards; he wanted to have reasonable, civilised living standards for Australians. We all recognise that we live in a difficult and competitive world&mdash;of course we do&mdash;but does that mean that we have to give up a fundamental system of civilised behaviour in terms of people's basic standards of living? Is that what we have to do? Is that what the opposition is advocating? Of course it is. That would be the result of its industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that we can compete with other economies, but we can compete with them and still maintain the fundamental minimum standards of wages and the minimum standards of conditions of employment for which we in Australia have worked for many years and which have been part of the Australian tradition. On 22 March 1904 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill starts with a confession that it is based on a humanitarian interpretation of the principles and obligations which form the very basis of civilized society. It leaves to its opponents the creed whose God is greed, whose devil is need, and whose paradise lies in the cheapest market.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said. The minister correctly quoted Deakin, because in fact we have now in this extremist federal opposition an abandonment of that truly liberal principle. Instead, we have this extreme New Right philosophy which would let us forget even a minimum standard of living for people and would let them go out to negotiate, as I said, with a gun at their heads. People would end up in a situation in which their standards of living, as the honourable member for Bennelong has admitted, would be significantly reduced. That is not the way in which to develop a growth economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, let me tell honourable members that, if the opposition had been elected and had tried to bring in such a system, we would have had so much industrial chaos in this country, so much industrial turmoil and upheaval, that whatever gains might have been made in the short term by a reduction in wages to below the minimum level would immediately have been lost. The reality is that that would have happened had the opposition been elected and tried to introduce that kind of system. The Australian people have shown over and over again that they believe in a fair go for everyone and they do not believe in the idea that we should have two classes of people&mdash;the employers having all the power and the employees having none. That would be the reality under a system such as that advocated by the honourable member for Bennelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is a reform bill. We are trying to adjust to the new situation of enterprise bargaining but without reducing the fundamental principles that have guided industrial relations in Australia for many years. The idea of a minimum standard, the idea of a safety net&mdash;protection for people&mdash;means that employees can negotiate a number of arrangements with their employer but will not be threatened by the employer saying, `Well, you have to go beyond this safety net. You have to reduce your standards of living. You have to reduce your conditions of employment'. Of course, if we were to adopt the approach advocated by the opposition, that is what would happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is wrong from even a philosophical point of view with a minimum wage? What is wrong with a basic, decent, civilised minimum wage for all people? Is this fundamentally at odds with human nature? Some people say yes. Some people believe that we should live in a society in which it is the survival of the fittest&mdash;that is to say, some kind of society where human beings behave like animals; a society in which people who are weak, who do not have a strong union or a strong bargaining position are thrown on to the scrap heap. We find similar behaviour in the animal world. But we are human beings and are not animals in that sense. Human beings have transcended that state. Human beings are capable of rational thought. Rational thought dictates that people have the right to equal treatment in terms of a decent, basic, minimum standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say that that right is not only for those who are employed. If honourable members look at the great traditions of social justice of our party&mdash;indeed, if they look at the last 10 years of social and welfare legislation&mdash;they will see that we have tried to guarantee a minimum standard of living even for people who are unemployed so that they have at least basic, civilised living standards. What do we find from the opposition? Opposition members have not only attacked workers but they have also put forward principles to attack the unemployed. They have put forward principles to attack people on welfare. They have put forward principles to reduce the whole system of support&mdash;for example, for working mothers and families&mdash;which we have put in place to help people. That includes of course the Medicare system, which helps people when they are sick. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the majority of opposition members have no concept of social justice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) is a good man who believes in social justice and is not someone who has the points of view of the honourable member for Bennelong. I shall now turn to some other aspects of the bill, which concern direct bargaining. Obviously, this bill goes beyond the current arrangements. It has very important reforms. As the minister says, employers will be able to have a whole set of flexible arrangements with their employees but these arrangements can be sideways or upwards. There can be arrangements about productivity. There can be arrangements about all sorts of issues concerning the workplace. There cannot be arrangements that go beyond or below the safety net&mdash;the protection which the award system has given and which has been the fundamental guarantee of industrial relations in Australia for a very long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why the opposition does not find this bill interesting and exciting. The honourable member for Bennelong used to believe in genuine direct bargaining. This bill goes further than any other legislation has for many years in giving us direct bargaining, and the honourable member should be supporting it instead of opposing it. What is the difference between the opposition's view and what is proposed in this bill? Is there not direct bargaining allowed in this bill? Of course there is. Are there not enterprise agreements in this bill? Of course there are. What is the difference? The only difference, as the honourable member for Bennelong knows, is that with his approach there would be no safety net, there would be no minimum, there would be no protection. He himself said that we cannot have the Deakin approach because there were higher standards of living then. What a disgrace. In other words, it is the real aim of the honourable member for Bennelong to reduce the worker's standard of living even further than it has already been reduced in a recession where the bulk of the burden has been borne by the workers. What a travesty of social justice it would be if that were to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have direct bargaining. We have flexibility. We have all those elements which supposedly the opposition wanted in industrial relations reform. I might say that, had there been a more progressive liberal on the front bench dealing with this matter, he would have welcomed the reforms. But of course what do we have? We have here, as I say, in charge of this kind of legislation&mdash;we heard earlier from the honourable member for Higgins and the honourable member for Bennelong&mdash;a New Right front in the Liberal Party that is not interested in even a single concession to social justice in these matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with a great deal of interest to the comments of the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), particularly his comments about social justice. Quite frankly, some of his comments about workers being impoverished and people having guns at their heads were a downright disgrace. I suspect it may have something to do with his background, coming through the university lecturing system, before he entered this place. Over the past couple of days I have taken a great deal of interest in looking at the backgrounds of other members who have spoken on the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. Working through them in order, we have had a union official, a teacher, another union official, a bank manager, a member whose employment category I have missed, someone who worked for Telecom, a lecturer, a teacher, another lecturer, a lawyer, a party official, a union secretary, a teacher, a farmer, another teacher, a lecturer&mdash;and it goes on and on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of our problem in this whole process is that the people who are talking about this legislation have no background in small business and in sitting down and negotiating on the workshop floor with their employees. I am one of a few on this side of the house who have been involved in small businesses where we do sit down and talk through the problems with the people on the workshop floor. I will get on to that matter a little further down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important in the overall process to remember that this government keeps telling us that it is compassionate and that it is going to solve the unemployment problem through its social justice programs. We have about 700,000 small businesses in this country. If each of those small businesses could employ one more employee, we would halve the problems of unemployment. But one of the great difficulties we have is this sort of legislation that is being dished up to us tonight in this parliament. It is one of the reasons that we are not going to solve these problems in the short term. Small business operators in this country are sick and tired of the additional pieces of paper and the 170-odd pages in this piece of legislation which are being put in front of them to solve the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have a difficulty with union movements representing people in big enterprises. There is a need in some instances for unions to get involved so that they can assist workers, but it is a two-sided system. It is not only businesses that are wrong. There are occasions, I would like to think, when some of those opposite should recognise and accept that unions are wrong in the way that they deal with people as well. This piece of legislation is a one-way street because it talks about enterprise bargaining and the unions looking at agreements before decisions are taken. There is no recognition of the fact that people may not want to be members of a union or that in the private sector some 71 per cent of employees are not involved in unions. It seems to me to be a pretty interesting process that starts to look at all the small operations around the country and to link them into the union movement. It worries the heck out of me. This government continually talks about solving the unemployment problem. I assure those opposite that there are many small businesses around this country that will look very carefully before putting on an additional employee as a result of the type of legislation that is being dished up here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government fails to realise that many of these businesses are family type businesses which have been handed down over the years and are operated perhaps by father, son and daughter. Many of the employees in some of these smaller businesses are almost part of the family. It is something that is totally disregarded in the legislation that the government has put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering enterprise bargaining, it was very interesting to hear the honourable member for Calwell saying that we on this side want to cut away entitlements and wages. It is our policy to have a minimum wage, and that is the award wage. It has been part of our policy all along. Listening to the rhetoric that he has been mouthing off in this place annoys me, and annoys members of the opposition, because it is simply not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the enterprise bargaining process, I believe that the government has failed to recognise that many of the workers will be better off under enterprise bargaining. It will be based on productivity. If employees get incentives to work better&mdash;to work harder in some instances, but not necessarily&mdash;with better methods and with better formats, they will encourage each other. They will see some sort of reward in the process for achieving that goal. The government does not provide anything in the current system to encourage that. In fact, for a number of years we have had wage increases without productivity increases, which has meant increases in the cost of manufacturing products in this country. If we cannot get the government to understand that, quite frankly, I will give the process away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that the real reason that the government is reluctant to recognise this fact is that, if wage increases were geared to productivity increases where people have an incentive to achieve and to start to get ahead of award wages, many of the people, some of whom I have mentioned, represented in this government through the various professions will start to realise&mdash;union membership is already falling away&mdash;that people within the private enterprise system who enter into enterprise bargaining arrangements will find themselves better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me when we start to talk about the rights and processes that we do get locked into Thatcherism, the New Right and whatever the government keeps mouthing off in its rhetoric. I do not know where it thinks I fit in the spectrum, but my interest is in making sure that this country gets back to where it was some years ago, where the younger people have an opportunity to have a job, where they can actually expect when they have completed a course to go out into a work force that welcomes them rather than go out into a work force that is very reluctant to employ them because employers may have a great deal of difficulty in keeping businesses running. I do not believe the government recognises the amount of effort that is put in by small businesses around this country in keeping its doors open and its employees employed. A problem for many businesses, particularly going through a recession period, is that they are often battling at the end of the week to make sure that the wages are on the desk for their employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trying to work with businesses to give them the opportunity to succeed has been bypassed by the government. Its process of social justice is to look at wages and try to get increases without providing the benefits on the other side or without providing the opportunity for businesses to succeed. It is important that the government recognises that the only reason the system functions is that there are companies in Australia operated by people who have a vision and who are prepared to get off their butts and make our system work. They are prepared to go out and earn the taxes to keep the system running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have two problems at the moment. The first is the reduction in the number of companies that are out there and able to do that. Secondly, and linked to that, we have been less competitive than we should have been with many of our overseas competitors. How does the government propose to improve that competitiveness with our overseas competitors? Is it by paying additional wages without linking them to productivity increases? Does the government have a solution?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is all very well to talk about social justice, philosophical differences, workers being impoverished and having guns at their heads, but the fact of the matter is that the system in which we live is made to go round. If we do not have businesses that operate to employ people, we do not have the taxes generated that keep the system functioning. I think there are many lessons to be learned by this government about the way in which this area is handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventy-one per cent of workers in the private sector do not belong to trade unions. There has been a lot said in this place over the last few days about the harsh way in which workers are treated by companies. If all of those comments were true, one would have to ask why this 71 per cent of people choose not to be members of trade unions. The answer is very simple: they do not get any benefit from being members of trade unions; they find that they have flexibility of employment under the management of the companies by which they are employed; and they find they are not being dragged out of the workplace into strikes that they do not feel a part of. I believe that that 71 per cent of workers have every right to operate on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this piece of legislation changes that process when it comes to improving opportunities, not just for the workers but for the companies as well. We must remember that companies need to derive some benefit from the process, and in most cases they are prepared to see that the worker also benefits. As an employer, prior to coming into this place, I was happy to pay above award wages and to make productivity payments because I had the production I needed to get into the marketplace and be competitive. That is the view that the average Australian manufacturer and producer takes. But where will they gain with the way in which this process is being handled?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is talking about enterprise bargaining as though it understands it; in fact, the government really does not understand how these situations are handled on the workshop floor. There are many problem areas facing small business today and with this legislation we may well see a lot of small business people saying, `I have had enough', throwing their arms in the air and walking away from it. In fact, many people in my electorate have said to me, `Quite frankly, it is not worth the effort. At the moment, I am only staying in business to pay my employees'. The real consequence of this process is that we may well see the doors of businesses in this country&mdash;particularly the smaller and medium sized businesses&mdash;closing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the government: what is this industrial relations bill really going to do for the unemployed? I believe that it will do nothing to solve the current problems and it might well increase the number of people in unemployment queues. That really concerns me. I recall a case in my electorate of a fellow in business who had five employees. He told me that his real difficulty was that, because his business was going through a hard time&mdash;as many businesses do during a recession&mdash;he could not afford to keep all five employees. Yet he recognised that each of those five people needed to take home a weekly wage in order to survive&mdash;the five were all from single income households. He decided to sit down with them and talk through the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of those discussions they all decided that they would rather work a four-day week and have at least four days pay than have one of their friends without a job at all. That is what they did. In fact, as things improved&mdash;which they did because of the reduction in overheads&mdash;the employer was able to rebuild his business and get it back on its feet. He then gave his employees the opportunity to return to a five-day week. In fact, some of them are now getting overtime as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the benefits of that sort of process? That Australianism is the way in which I would like to see social justice work. The benefit is that all of those five people still have a job. Yes, their work might have been slightly reduced but at least they still had work. The manager of the business was very grateful for the way in which the employees accepted the one day a week reduction because it enabled him to keep his business functioning. In return, he felt that he owed something to his employees. When the business picked up he gave them the opportunity to get back what they had given up. To me, that is what industrial relations is all about: management and workers, irrespective of the size of the company, being able to work together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would a company of that size get out of this legislation? I suggest it would mean drafting an enterprise agreement that cut work back to four days a week; having to go through the Industrial Court process; having the union upset by the reduction to four days a week with the possibility of confrontation. I suspect that that would have done absolutely nothing for that small business&mdash;and that business is not in isolation. There are thousands upon thousands of businesses of that size across the country. Some of those businesses are presently going through a phase of trying to pull through. I know of a number which, although they have never closed their doors, really have no other option. The only reason that they have not done so is that they cannot afford the redundancy payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a business gets to the stage of being unable to pay the wages at the end of a week a number of things occur. When the doors finally close there are insufficient funds to pay redundancy payments anyway. So who has gained? The business certainly has not; it has gone to the wall. The employee certainly has not because there is nothing left in the coffers to pay for the redundancy. Is that the sort of system that we want operating in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am prepared to concede that there are systems which do not function as well as they should; where employers do not do the right thing by employees. I am prepared to concede that. We need to address those problems, and there are avenues through which they can be addressed. If unions do need to step in, I have no argument with that; that is a method of solving and rectifying those problems. Still, why put the 71 per cent of Australians in the private sector who are not in the union system through all this drama?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these small businesses would say that there is far too much paperwork to deal with. The government should re-examine this process. I would like to think that it is not a cynical payback exercise for the benefit of the ACTU. While a number of the comments made by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) appear to ring true, it may well be that there is just some lack of understanding about how the process works. I would like to have seen the government with some people who actually ran small businesses and understood some of the problems on the workshop floor. Of course, one of the problems is that the government really does not have many such people among its ranks. It is a pity that it places Australian small business in this position. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this amendment is to delete section 122 of the principal act. That is designed to take out of the existing law the facility which is there for the making of, and the insertion in awards of, preference clauses. Consonant with our strong belief that there should be no form of preference or privilege granted to a section in the industrial relations bargain, nor indeed should there be any form of victimisation or discrimination, we cannot accept a situation where preference clauses can be granted to people who are members of unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever may be said in defence of them, one argument that cannot be heard is that they do not take place because plainly they do. I have had ample evidence presented to me and if the minister addresses this matter candidly he will acknowledge that preference clauses are inserted from time to time. Preference is given to people who are members of unions over people who are not members of unions. That is wrong. It is a form of blatant discrimination and, at a time when this government gets out of the tree about other forms of discrimination, it seems very strange to us that there should continue to be discrimination in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat to the minister an example drawn to my attention in the past 18 months of people who applied for positions as interpreters with the then Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, nominating their skills in particular European and Asian languages. They responded to public advertisements inserted in major newspapers and they received a reply from the department saying that their applications could not be entertained because the department had entered into an agreement with the Public Sector Union to consider only applications from members of that union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, I tell the committee, has occurred in Australia during the lifetime of the Keating-Hawke governments&mdash;I think over the last 18 months. I have the correspondence in my Sydney office and I am arranging for it to be sent to me by fax. I will personally show it to the minister. I have already made it available publicly and to the parliament in the context of other debates. That is open and shut evidence that that kind of discrimination is going on. If the person were rejected on the grounds that the person was a woman, was Chinese, Jewish, Catholic or Italian it would be all over the papers. But, because that person's point of discrimination is that that person does not belong to a union, there is no reference to it. It is a big joke and it can apparently go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House do not see this in terms of workers against bosses or some kind of old outdated class war; it is a simple question of freedom. If people have the qualifications for a job they are entitled to be considered for that job. The fact that they happen to be of a particular race, a particular religion, a particular disposition or have joined or not joined a union ought not matter. Yet plainly under the Keating-Brereton regime it still does matter. That is why we want this section taken out and why we will be speaking very strongly, in a similar vein, to another amendment&mdash;which I will move in a moment&mdash;in relation to the conditions that have to be observed in the employment of people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief because I appreciate that the time for this committee stage is very short. I wish to speak to this amendment and indicate to the House that the point that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) makes is very valid. There is an aspect to this amendment which the government has hoped will pass without notice: namely, the provision that preference should be given to unionists is totally in contravention of the government's affirmative action policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have pointed out in this House before that there are some occasions in which Australian Public Service jobs are advertised and available only to members of the public service. I am amazed that Labor Party women have not screamed to the heavens about this because this is the classic situation that the affirmative action act was meant to overcome. This practice entrenches whatever discrimination exists. Those presently employed and members of the union are given preference. Somebody who is outside the work force is not a member of the union and will not become a member of the union until employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anything that entrenches continuing employment patterns is anti-affirmative action. I am sorry that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) shakes his head and does not listen. He shook his head when I started. I wonder where the women of the Labor Party are tonight and where they were in the debate in their party room. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a union background. When I came into this parliament I was a member of a union, and I am still a member of the same union. I understand very well what preference for union members meant in university administration, for example. If a person was not employed in university administration, that person would not know a job was available, because of a union deal&mdash;a standard union deal&mdash;with employers to give internal preference before bringing in outsiders. Unions see all sorts of dangers in outsiders coming in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real outsiders are women who have been outside the work force, rearing families and maybe getting qualifications to come back into the work force. Any deal which gives preference to people presently employed is anti-women and anti-affirmative action. That needs to be recognised. I do not believe the minister can answer that without a degree of sophistry. I would really like to hear the women members of the government address that subject publicly, in this place. I cannot believe they have addressed it in their party room or that they have faced it in the work force&mdash;as I did when I was previously employed in university administration before coming into this House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly make a few remarks about why the government does not accept the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bennelong. No-one could accuse the opposition of being inconsistent. The views he has expressed tonight are absolutely consistent with long-standing opposition policy. It reflects an ideological opposition to workers having a chance to organise collectively and effectively. Section 122 is not, as the opposition would have people believe, a charter for either closed shops or compulsory unionism. It confers power on the Industrial Relations Commission to award preference in employment to members of federally registered unions. I point out that the power has been used very sparingly by the commission. It is not an everyday practice&mdash;far from it. It is used extremely sparingly and only in justifiable circumstances; for example, if an employer is discriminating against union members. That is the sort of circumstance in which the commission has sought to use this power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 the government strengthened the conscientious objection provisions for people who genuinely do not want to belong to unions. This government has done that; and that provides an appropriate exemption from preference or from unfair discrimination against non-unionists. I would also like to note that the amendment might, even in the context of other amendments, have the paradoxical effect of allowing the commission to award compulsory unionism. That is the last thing the honourable member for Bennelong would want. I put it to him that, as a result of the power to award preference having been held by the High Court to limit jurisdiction in this respect, repealing section 122&mdash;I am advised&mdash;would give the commission its full jurisdiction. So apart from being wrong in principle, this amendment might even achieve the opposite of the opposition's purpose. For all these reasons, the government cannot accept the proposed amendment. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment goes to the heart of the issue of principle of what the opposition is concerned about in this committee debate. Our position is very simple; we believe that people should have the absolute freedom to join or not join a union. We believe that people should be absolutely free of victimisation or discrimination, irrespective of their social status, religious background, sex, political beliefs or whether or not they believe in joining a union. It is not a sufficient answer for the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) to say that the Industrial Relations Commission has the power to grant conscientious objection. Nor is it good enough for the minister to say that this power to grant preference or do this or that relating to fundamental freedoms can be exercised only by the commission. A freedom either is fundamental or it is not. Once anybody or any group of people are granted the power to qualify a freedom, that freedom is diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the minister to say that it is acceptable for the commission to decide whether or not a preference clause should be granted is the equivalent of the minister saying that it is acceptable for the commission to decide whether or not a Jew or Chinese person should be employed. The principle is no different. We either believe in anti-discrimination or we do not. The trouble with those people in the Australian Labor Party is that they are selective and discriminatory in what is anti-discrimination. They carry on about their credentials on sexual, religious and racial discrimination, but when it comes to discriminating in the workplace, they are the most blatant bigots Australia has ever seen. It is about time their hypocrisy on this issue was exposed because this is a matter of freedom; it has nothing to do with my ideological views about trade unions but whether they believe in freedom. </PARA>

What earthly right does the government have to say that in certain circumstances those people in Australian society who are not members of a union, do not want to belong to a union, refuse to join a union and have decided of their own free will not to join a union will be discriminated against?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the minister that as a matter of principle I do not have any argument with that. Our own industrial relations policy contains an absolute discrimination against people being victimised because they are members of a union or because they participate in union affairs in reasonable circumstances. I have no argument with that at all. What we are saying with this particular amendment&mdash;I hope it does not suffer the same fate as the last amendment&mdash;is that if the law says that we must not discriminate against people if they belong to a union, why is it not equally fair to say we must not discriminate against them if they do not belong to a union?

Our problem, if the minister is interested, is the fact that the government does not make it an offence to sack someone for not being a member of a union. There are some people in the gallery who are not members of a union. They have employees who are not members of a union and do not wish to be members of a union.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the three minutes that remain may I take the opportunity of summarising again the position of the coalition on this measure. We will vote against the third reading of this bill because we find the fundamental changes that it brings about totally obnoxious. Those fundamental changes are the destruction of the secondary boycott clauses, without any colour of justification other than a desire to genuflect before the power of the trade union movement in Australia. For 16 years those clauses have protected small business. For 16 years they have been seen as an exemplar of balancing the legal situation between business and employees. For 16 years, if a union destroyed the business of a small employer in this country by secondary boycott, that union could be exposed to immediate injunctive relief at the hands of the employer as, indeed, another employer could.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we seek to do by the retention of these clauses is to treat like conduct in a like fashion. What the government has done with this clause is to put the trade union movement above the law when it comes to the imposition of secondary boycotts. That is fundamentally un-Australian. It is totally unacceptable to the attitude that is taken by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other objectionable feature of this bill is the unnecessary use of the external affairs power of the constitution. This government has perverted and undermined the constitutional balance of this country by its remorseless use of the external affairs power. A party that proclaims republicanism in the name of Australian independence is happy to hand over to dubious international bodies increasing amounts of power over the domestic legal affairs of this country. We have not had from the government satisfactory assurances about voluntary unionism. We look with interest at the result of the government's deliberations on the amendment I moved just a few moments ago. The last thing I want to say is to remark upon the monumental hypocrisy of a government that would enact a clause that reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An employer must not terminate an employee's employment for reasons related to the employee's conduct or performance, unless the employee has been given the opportunity to defend himself or herself against the allegations made.</PARA>
<PARA>This government is presided over by a man who has just sacked a member of his own department without giving any explanation and has just caused to be sacked two other employees of his household without any kind of explanation. That is the measure of the hypocrisy that is represented by this outfit on the question of industrial relations. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says, `Don't do what I do; do what I say'. The government loads upon the small employers of this country impossible additional conditions. The Prime Minister says, `But when I want to get rid of some meddlesome public servant, I do it with a snap of the fingers'. No wonder the government's Prime Minister is held in such contempt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In tonight's adjournment debate I want to draw this House's attention to further material in relation to the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program. The issue is of such serious magnitude that it warrants further comment in this House. I might use the forum of the adjournment debate to try to get some information from the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). Earlier in the day, I tried to get information regarding this issue from the parliamentary library. However, the library informed me the minister's office had issued a directive to the library that all requests for information in regard to the sporting grants program must be referred to the minister's office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to be suspicious of such a directive. It is indeed a sad day in this place when a representative of the executive does not possess sufficient confidence in the impartiality and expertise of the parliamentary library to provide information that she directs it to refer all inquiries to her office. I would anticipate that such a request is incredibly rare and I would be greatly interested to hear the minister's explanation for making such a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing that directive in mind, I use this debate to ask the minister how it can be that a Labor candidate is able to provide information regarding the success of a grant to the applicant when to this day the sitting member has not been informed. This is, indeed, a serious matter and one which goes to the very heart of the way this government administers funding to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad to say the experience from the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories is not an isolated one. However, I shall confine my comments this evening to the sporting grants program. Just over a year ago, an organisation which provides excellent service to the community came to see me to seek information on how it might be able to receive funding for a new boatshed for a rescue boat. In my capacity as the local member, I suggested it make application to the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program. I obtained the application form for this organisation and sponsored its application with a letter direct to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some five months later, and just prior to the last federal election, the president of the organisation contacted me to say that he had just been informed by the Labor candidate for my seat that the application was successful. The Labor candidate, I might add, was at that time on the personal staff of another minister in the Keating government and to my knowledge she still works for him. This was the candidate's first ever contact with the organisation and she then proceeded to inform the local media how she had been solely responsible for the success of this application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply ask the minister: how it is that a Labor candidate working for one of her ministerial colleagues who has had no prior contact with the organisation is able to inform it of the success of its application while the elected member has still, some 10 months later, not been informed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, this is not an isolated case. The former minister for community services, before he was dumped from the ministry, adopted a similar procedure for providing information. However, on a day when the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has had to defend herself against a second censure motion within 18 months, I think it is particularly apt for me to raise this issue with her. It is particularly apt, given that she has directed the Parliamentary Library to refuse to answer questions relating to the funding program and to redirect all correspondence to her office on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about the amazing assertions made in this House today regarding a sporting organisation in my electorate. Allegations were made that the Logan South Rugby and Sporting Club has no players, no grounds and, in fact, does not even exist. These allegations are typical of the opposition&mdash;an opposition that is not interested in facts when it thinks it might be able to get some political mileage to raise its flagging fortunes. Let me put opposition members straight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, Logan City, where the club&mdash;which I can assure opposition members does exist&mdash;is, is one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. It is an area which, until now, has been sadly lacking in sporting facilities of any kind. This is a problem which I do not doubt is not nearly so rife in the electorates represented by opposition members. I would have hoped that, for once, those opposite could put their prejudices aside and think of the youth of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give opposition members some facts. Recognising the need for a sporting club, community minded people set about putting in place the structures to give the youth of the area an opportunity that did not exist previously. Throughout 1992, with the support of the administrations of both the Queensland Rugby Union and the Logan City Netball Association, the Logan City Workers Club recruited and trained young men and women with the aim of providing them with skills needed to participate in sports. Their efforts indeed paid off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not counting support workers, there are 38 active netballers who make up five competing teams&mdash;38 young women ranging in age from 12 years to their 30s. Their first outdoor team commenced playing in February 1993 and they are already making a name for themselves within the competition run by the Logan City Netball Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The club's rugby teams commenced official competition in February 1993. Since then, teams have been fielded in the Queensland subdistricts competition, the Caledonian Rugby Sevens and later in the year in the Maroochydore Sevens competition. The under-16 junior side competed all year in the Queensland Junior Rugby Union Competition and, indeed, were semi-finalists in this competition. I think the House would agree it was a busy year for a club that does not exist!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 20 November 1992, the club has had a written agreement with Marsden High School to use the school's playing fields as a home ground. The school has benefited from this arrangement by having floodlights installed by the non-existent club and arrangements have been made for the provision of showers and dressing rooms which the school pupils are also able to use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me stress to opposition members that this grant is being used for the purpose for which it was intended: to provide facilities which will directly benefit those who need them most. If those opposite had cared to check before making spurious allegations, they would have found that there are at least 56 registered rugby players, along with the aforementioned netballers. I personally sponsor a touch football team. As well, there is currently recruitment for softball teams. </PARA>

I would ask the opposition: how is it that a player, Trevor Lane from Logan City Workers Rugby Club, has been selected by Queensland Rugby Union to play for the Queensland secondary schools side?  As well, at least one student from Marsden High School, Matthew Downey, has benefited from the club's support in assisting him to travel, as part of the Queensland secondary schools side, to New Guinea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rugby union is one of the world's great amateur sporting codes. I would ask the honourable member for Ballarat whether he is suggesting that only young people from Toorak or the North Shore of Sydney be permitted to play rugby. Fortunately for our young people this is not the attitude of this government; neither is it the attitude of the Queensland Rugby Union administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this grant assisted the club, it is still up to parents and supporters to raise money to purchase equipment, uniforms and jerseys. These grants are not given lightly; eligibility is governed by strict guidelines which must be adhered to. I only wish I could walk into the office of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and demand money for my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recipient body had to prove the need and fulfil a number of requirements. As much as the opposition might think the minister for sport is a pushover, let me assure them that she is not; she is very much aware that there is never enough money to meet the demands. As a result, applications are carefully vetted to ensure that available funds go to the areas of most need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to raise an issue of importance to the Australian honey industry, and that is the entry of Australian honey into New Zealand. The New South Wales Apiarists Association believes that New Zealand is using quarantine as a trade barrier merely to protect its own honey market. Australian honey as well as New Zealand honey does have a small incidence of American brood disease and this disease does affect young bees in the hive and can be passed on in honey. I hasten to say that it is harmless to humans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New Zealand honey industry has exactly the same problem, but the New Zealand honey industry has convinced its government not to allow Australian honey in by saying that the brood disease is different from its own. I believe that this is totally untrue. CER, which I support, is a one-way street in terms of honey. New Zealand is exporting more than 30 tonnes of honey into Australia every month. Beekeeping is a very important industry for Australia. We produce 26,000 tonnes of honey annually; we export 12,000 tonnes a year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Undoubtedly they are. We are the fourth highest exporter of honey in the world. Our honey is sought worldwide because of its quality. However, as a result of a number of factors, there is a glut of honey in Australia at the moment and the imports of New Zealand honey, in excess of 30 tonnes a month, are having a most adverse affect on our beekeepers. From my own personal knowledge, there are many beekeepers on the north coast of New South Wales and on the northern tablelands who receive only about $1.10 a kilo, and any intrusion into their market when they cannot export to New Zealand is not fair or just.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has honoured its commitments and New Zealand honey is allowed to enter Australia under certain conditions. All I ask on behalf of the Australian beekeepers is for New Zealand to allow our honey in under the same conditions. Unfortunately, New Zealand repeatedly defers the deadlines on previous agreements and Australian honey is not permitted to enter New Zealand under any conditions. I repeat: CER is an admirable agreement, it is working for Australia and for New Zealand, but the honey producers of Australia need to get fairness and equity and justice compared with their colleagues across the Tasman. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Saturday, 30 October 1993 I had the pleasure to attend the centenary celebrations of the Forest Hill State School in my electorate of Oxley. More than 3,000 people attended the day despite the constant threat of rain. Of course, such rain would have been well received because the Lockyer Valley is badly in need of good rain. Past pupils, teachers and Forest Hill residents came from places such as New Zealand, Townsville and Sydney to take part in the celebrations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A series of class reunions for past pupils from the early 1900s right through to the present day were held. Ninety-two-year-old Norma Darlington&mdash;the oldest pupil present on the day&mdash;82-year-old Lily Robinson, and fourth generation pupil Samuel Pocock, cut the school's centenary cake. Other activities organised on the day included performances by a band of past pupils, a parade of transport through the ages, and displays put on by pupils. One of the highlights of the day was the re-enactment of the arrival by horse and sulky of the school's first teacher, Miss Mary Rachel Tait, followed by a cavalcade of pupils in period costume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centenary celebrations were not limited to the school, with the people of Forest Hill joining in the party spirit by decorating their shops, houses and streets with colourful balloons and streamers for the occasion. Forest Hill State School has made a substantial contribution to Forest Hill, the Lockyer Valley and the region generally over the past 100 years. This contribution has been made possible by the support of the community for the school and the strong school spirit which has developed.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The support of the community began with the work of the original committee which began planning the school in August 1890 and worked consistently to achieve the opening of the school on 23 January 1893. The facilities of the original school were modest, consisting of one room and eight desks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the decades that followed, the number of children attending the school continued to grow, peaking at 166 students in 1914. While the school has expanded and been upgraded over the years with the support of government, much of the progress achieved by the school would not have been possible without the support of parents and the Forest Hill community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The school has come a long way since 1893 and has, particularly in recent years, been at the forefront of educational change. One of these changes has been the introduction into the school of the language other than English program, which will give students at the school a solid grounding in learning a second language, a skill which is vital for our national economic and social development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centenary celebrations were a reflection of both Forest Hill's proud history and its willingness to face the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate two school students from the electorate of Fisher who will be in the House over the next couple of nights. Joanne Page, a year 12 student from Caboolture State High School and Tracey Close, a year 7 student from Mount Kilcoy State School, were the winners of an essay competition I conducted in the electorate earlier this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essay competition was open to all students and all schools in the electorate and consisted of two sections&mdash;a primary section and a secondary section. Students were asked to write on a subject of their own choice. The response from schools was excellent, with 17 schools submitting more than 100 essays. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V5">Mr SLIPPER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Seventeen schools and 100 essays. The essays were judged during the September school holidays by a panel of three current and former school teachers living in Fisher. I would like to thank Alan Evans, Carole Dobson and Anne Peil for the time and effort they put into judging the essay competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Joanne Page's essay entitled `The power of the press' won the senior division, while the essay by Tracey Close entitled `Australia's future' won the primary section. Joanne's essay on the role and power of the media in today's society is particularly topical at the moment and is worth reading to the House in full when time permits. Tracey's essay is also of value as it looks at Australia's future through the eyes of a 12-year-old. She deals with the environmental concerns of today's youth, employment concerns, and considers Australia as part of the global system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the time remaining I would like to read Tracey's essay, as I believe it is important to listen to what the nation's youth has to say. They are, after all, the nation's future. The essay reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's Future by Tracey Close.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's future is very important for the generation of which I am a part of, and I think it is necessary for us to have our say and talk about things that concern us. Soil conservation is a very important part of Australia's future. Without it, we couldn't grow anything. Everything that man uses comes from the soil in the start. To prevent our precious soil from disappearing we should plant more trees and be more soil conscious. The soil needs protecting so we can ensure our farming future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People in Australia use up too much energy. We need to help save our fossil fuels by using alternative energy sources such as solar, wind and hydro power. We need to think carefully when considering our energy needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another thing Australians can do is buy Australia made products where possible. This supports our hard working farmers and industries who depend so much on people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Price may or may not be an indication of quality. It is up to you to decide. Many people still pollute Australia's scenic landscapes and clear, sparkling waters. We have a superb country so let's not "waste" it. We should try to reduce our reliance on pollution causing substances and recycle everything that can be recycled or reuse them. Attitudes are changing towards the three Rs. At home, we recycle our food scraps by giving them to our chooks and we also recycle our bottles, cans and cardboard. It all helps to conserve our country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If all Australia work as one, we can make our country even more special. We must co-operate and work together so we can achieve our goals. Goals which will lift us to higher heights and to show the world what a patriotic, dedicated and splendid country we truly are.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So put on a happy face and adopt a positive attitude and look after our land down under. It's a wonderful place. It's also my generations future and we are concerned.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) publication "Motor Vehicle Registrations", there were 439,500 commercial freight carrying trucks registered in Australia at the end of June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) There is generally no agreed definition of what constitutes `long haulage' trucks and consequently no definitive answer on the number of such trucks. However, the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics (BTCE) has estimated that over 95 per cent of long distance road freight is hauled on articulated trucks, predominantly six axle vehicles. On the other hand, some of these vehicles are used in shorter freight haulage. According to the ABS there was a total of 51,000 articulated trucks registered in Australia at the end of June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The ABS estimates average fuel consumption for six axle articulated trucks at around 50 litres per 100 kilometres travelled. The National Road Transport Commission estimates the average annual distance travelled by these vehicles at about 120,000 kms. A vehicle travelling around 120,000 kilometres a year would thus consume about 60,000 litres of diesel each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The quantity of fuel excise paid by the operator of a six axle articulated truck consuming 60,000 litres of diesel each year, based on a pre-Budget diesel excise level of 26.573 cents per litre, amounts to almost $16,000 per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) There is no unique definition of the `trucking industry'. However, the BTCE has estimated that additional Budget revenue from the full 5 cents per litre increase in excise on diesel used by trucks and cars (which will not be fully in place before August 1994) is some $300 million a year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) My remarks on this subject, like those of other Ministers, were appropriately qualified, given that no definitive estimate can yet be made of compensation costs associated with validation of past grants because of factors that are yet to be determined by the courts. It is certainly the case that compensation costs will be spread over a number of years, as the Minister for Finance stated in Parliament on 20 October (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, page 2221). In addition, this issue was carefully and frankly canvassed in the Government's Discussion Paper released in June 1993.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) This is a matter for the courts, but the proposed Commonwealth native title legislation will require that compensation be on "just terms" for the extinguishment of native title through the validation process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Australia is a party to many international agreements which include provisions dealing with human rights issues, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Charter and many others. To the extent that these agreements create specific obligations upon the Australian Government, the ADF is bound by them. In addition, the ADF is bound by a range of Australian laws and government policies on issues relating to human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government is careful to remain well-informed about human rights and conditions in many countries of the world. It is not appropriate to discuss the sources of information on which the Government draws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Each nation's armed forces' obligations in relation to human rights will vary with that nation's international agreements, national laws and government policies. Broad norms of human rights, such as those expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are widely shared. But specific obligations can vary from country to country. Government policy does not prohibit military-to-military contact with those nations whose human rights obligations are not the same as Australia's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) ADF personnel are extensively trained in human rights issues appropriate to their responsibilities. All Staff Colleges and the Australian Defence Force Academy include the study of international humanitarian law through instruction and training in the application of the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), that part of international law which regulates the conduct of armed hostilities between states. The ADF has taken steps to put LOAC training into practice during major exercises, where ADF members receive the level of LOAC training and instruction appropriate to their duties and responsibilities. Basic LOAC instruction is included in recruit training courses with more comprehensive training provided for members involved in operations, and in promotion and career development courses.</PARA>

The ADF has, however, provided professional training for individual members of the Indonesian Armed Forces. Where possible, ADF policy is that Indonesians will attend normal professional and technical courses available to members of the ADF. The length of courses ranges from three weeks (eg maritime air surveillance) to several months (eg navigation, hydrography), with some Staff College courses of 12 months' duration. The Indonesian students are usually officers, and represent a cross-section of the Indonesian Armed Forces. Australian instructors are members of the ADF posted to training functions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The Government draws on a wide range of impartial sources of information about a number of regional issues, including those involved in the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) Allegations of human rights violations by Indonesian units with which the ADF undertakes combined exercises have focussed on Indonesia's Special Forces, KOPASSUS. The ADF has had limited exercise contact with KOPASSUS, which has involved exercising basic military war fighting skills (not designed to improve proficiency in counter-insurgency or related activities) and familiarity with each others' military concepts and doctrine. The ADF does not propose to disengage from these limited exercises, but in determining their nature and scope it has taken into account Australian Government policy on human rights issues. Human rights considerations will continue to be taken into account in determining ADF policy on combined exercises with Indonesia. Australia develops defence links with the Indonesian Armed Forces, including KOPASSUS, because it is in the interest of Australia and the region as a whole in helping to build better understanding and cooperation. As the Prime Minister has indicated, we need to look at human rights issues as part of a total relationship.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government sees Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) as a way of giving expression and structure to an emerging sense of community in the region which reflects the growing economic integration and the shared goals and aspirations of the APEC economies. Its focus is trade and investment facilitation and liberalisation, not integration along EC lines. As I said in Jakarta, the Government is talking about a community of open regionalism, a `GATT-plus' structure. We do not intend APEC to become a preferential trading arrangement based on a formal treaty structure like the European Community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable members's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) As at 12 November 1993, forty (40) countries are known to have announced, or acknowledged, recognition of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYRM). For many of these countries recognition flowed automatically from their support for the FYRM's membership of the United Nations in April 1993. Many recognised the Republic as the "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", the interim name under which it was admitted to the UN, some as the "Republic of Macedonia" and some have avoided specifying the name under which they have recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) &amp; (3) Australia, along with a number of other nations, has been awaiting the outcome of bilateral attempts between Greece and the FYRM to resolve the name and associated issues before moving to recognition of the FYRM. Australia supported UN membership of the FYRM but this did not in itself amount to recognition, which in Australian practice requires a separate and deliberate act and cannot be inferred from any other action taken by the Government. Only duly accredited consular or diplomatic representatives can carry out the functions which are the sole prerogative of a consul. The opening of an office by the FYRM to perform consular functions and the accreditation of a consular representative cannot proceed until Australia recognises the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The issue of recognition remains under continuing review.</PARA>
