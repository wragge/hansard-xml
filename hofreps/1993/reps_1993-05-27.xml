<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Yesterday the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) raised a matter of privilege as a result of comments by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) during Question Time concerning a report of the Auditor-General on government debt. The honourable member said that the Treasurer had claimed that changes had been made to the report as a result of a letter sent to the Auditor-General. The honourable member expressed the view that any attempt, particularly by the Executive Government, to interfere with such reports must represent a breach of privilege.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have examined the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> green of the question asked by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), and the Treasurer's response. The Treasurer said, among other things, that on 13 April his department was asked to comment on the report in question. The Treasurer then quoted from the department's response and stated that `to some extent the authors toned down the paragraph in question'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have considered the remarks of the honourable member for O'Connor and those of the Treasurer in light of the law and precedents relating to privilege and contempt. On the information available to me, the Treasurer's remarks do not indicate that a matter of privilege or contempt exists. A prima facie case has not been made out, and accordingly I am not willing to give precedence to a motion in relation to the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) also raised a matter of privilege. His complaint concerned the alleged actions of the honourable member for O'Connor in entering the House to vote in a division, and he alleged that the honourable member had pushed past a staff member to gain entry to the chamber. I have made inquiries with regard to this matter and, on the information available to me, I do not believe that an issue of privilege or contempt is involved. However, the circumstances as alleged certainly, in my view, raise a serious issue of order or decorum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on this matter. Standing orders 199 and 200 deal with the right of entry of members to the chamber in the case of a division. Standing order 199 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before a division is taken, the Clerk shall ring the division bells and turn a 4 minute sand-glass, kept on the Table for that purpose, and the doors shall not be closed until after the lapse of 4 minutes, as indicated by such sand-glass.</PARA>
<PARA>Standing order 200 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The doors shall be closed and locked after the lapse of 4 minutes, and then no Member may enter or leave the Chamber until after the division.</PARA>
<PARA>It would be obvious, Mr Speaker, from these very clear orders that the right of a member to enter the chamber to undertake his duty to vote in this place is prevented only after the doors have actually been locked. It was my understanding of this standing order, and the obvious innocent misunderstanding of this rule by the attendant concerned, that caused the disagreement at the door which, considering my actual entry, clearly was not locked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, it has been conveyed to me that the attendant concerned was upset by the incident. In the context that I certainly had no intention to cause her concern, or at that moment in time to explain the Standing Orders relating to the situation, I would like to say to her now that I am very sorry that she was upset by my action in demanding my rightful entry. I recognise that she acted in what was her interpretation of her duty; I sincerely hope she now understands that I acted in what was my interpretation of my duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attendants of this chamber and the officers of this Parliament have my highest regard and respect, and I believe most would recognise the respect and politeness I openly offer them from time to time. This instance was an aberration caused by the simple fact of there being no time to explain my reasons when rushing to a division. Had the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) not taken his precipitate action, it was my intention to have spoken to the attendant concerned to explain the Standing Orders and to reassure her that I understood her action in seeking to prevent me entering the Parliament. I proposed to do this, had things not been different, immediately after the division involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this issue would have been prevented had all members of the attendant staff had a better understanding of the Standing Orders that relate to their duties.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the South Pacific, 24 July to 11 August 1989. It might seem ancient history to be presenting a report of a delegation from 1989 and the matter of this report has had its moments, I can tell you, Mr Speaker. Anyway, I am very pleased that it is now presented to the Parliament because it contains some important information, not least the contacts with the former Prime Minister of Fiji, Timoci Bavadra, and a statement by him that is contained in that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation visited four South Pacific countries, namely the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Vanuatu and Western Samoa. It was, as I understand it, the first delegation from the Australian Parliament to make a thorough going visit to South Pacific countries. In the past, I think views had been taken that there were other countries that were more significant to Australia and in the competition for funds for delegations the South Pacific countries had not been highly rated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that delegation there has been a number of such delegations and there is one leaving very shortly, as I understand it. I see this as a very important function of the Australian Parliament. The South Pacific nations on the whole are small and they are not countries that necessarily can afford to participate in a very wide ranging way in the affairs of visits to other countries and in making the necessary contacts that are so important in the flow of friendship and good relations between countries. Australia, therefore, has a very important role to play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last Parliament, it was my privilege to be Deputy Leader of the Australian Delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union conferences and to participate in the grouping of Asia-Pacific nations. Of the countries in that, there were only two Pacific nations&mdash;Australia and New Zealand. Fiji had been eligible in the past but some time ago it lost its eligibility to attend because it did not have a parliament, following its second military coup. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the whole, as I said, those small countries do not get the opportunity to participate and it was our privilege at that conference to make sure that, in that world forum of parliaments, proper attention was paid to the concerns of the Pacific. I instance that at one conference one of the two major subjects listed for discussion related to the environment and, of course, the subject of driftnet fishing is one that is very important to those small Pacific nations. It was one that was raised with the delegation on a number of occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more we know about our South Pacific neighbours and the better our relations, the better it is, I think, for proper consideration of world affairs. On the whole, our relations with South Pacific countries are excellent. There is the odd hiccup with a country or a leader here or there. We were having that sort of experience at the time with the Solomon Islands. Nevertheless, our contacts with parliamentarians from the Solomon Islands, from the Deputy Prime Minister down&mdash;because the Prime Minister would not agree to meet us&mdash;were excellent, and our discussions were very fruitful, cordial and warm. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 1992 ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisation Conference, AIPO, Jakarta, Indonesia, incorporating bilateral visits to Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Thailand, 15 September to 3 October 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992 parliamentary delegation to the AIPO conference was significant in a number of respects. The level of representation was higher than those previously sent to AIPO by Australia, consisting, as it did, of me as leader, Senator Grant Tambling, then shadow Minister for the community services, external territories and Northern Australia as deputy leader, Senator Mal Colston, Deputy President of the Senate, and two senior members, my colleague the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) and the former long serving member for Franklin, Bruce Goodluck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such representation reflected Australia's heightened awareness and recognition of AIPO and, through it, ASEAN as well as Australia's role in the Asia-Pacific region. As I indicated in my opening statement to the AIPO Conference, ASEAN has become the most important organisation in South-East Asia. Its success in seeking cooperation on common problems and issues not only amongst member states but also with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond has grown from strength to strength. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterated to the conference the view which had been expressed both prior to our visit and since in many fora by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that Australia's future is linked to Asia, that Australia is actively seeking to integrate itself further in the region. Australia wishes to encourage and support more interactions between our peoples at all levels in society to continue to build people-to-people bridges. Annual meetings of AIPO are an important strand in strengthening these linkages with ASEAN. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As parliamentarians we represent various sections of our communities and contribute by providing feedback through our parliamentary duties to the policies of our governments. I also expressed my belief to AIPO, shared by the Government, that there are more issues which bind the countries of ASEAN and Australia together than those which divide us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the recommendations of the report to the House and particularly those relating to the main purpose of our visit, the AIPO Conference. I point out that the delegation has recommended that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade respond to the Parliament within three months of tabling this report in relation to particular recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw the House's attention to recommendations relating to the bilateral visits to Papua New Guinea, Indonesia itself and Thailand. The delegation also made a bilateral visit to Papua New Guinea where we were honoured guests of the 17th Independence Day celebrations. We fulfilled a large number of appointments in Indonesia when time permitted between breaks at the AIPO Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very impressed with the progress Indonesia is making and the stability of the government there. At a time when Australia is increasingly focusing on matters economic, I note that Indonesia has a 25-year planning period with five-year tranches. We subsequently made a bilateral visit to Thailand, where we were the first delegation from another country to meet the new Presiding Officers, other parliamentarians and Ministers, following the September 1992 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, it was the desire of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), to increase the profile of Australia at the AIPO Conference. The committee has made a number of recommendations in that regard. At the conference AIPO agreed on an enhanced role for observer countries such as Australia. The delegation has drawn attention in its recommendations to the degree and quality of support services provided to the delegation by the Australian post in Jakarta. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation had a debriefing session and has corresponded with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on matters of concern in the hope that future delegations might be a little better served. I hope this report will be of assistance to the next AIPO delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank my co-delegates and their spouses. I would especially like to thank, on my behalf and on behalf of all members of the delegation and our spouses, our delegation secretary, Mr Dan Barton. He did an outstanding job of organising, herding and negotiating. Whatever the difficulty or challenge, he was always able to overcome it. He never once lost his pleasant manner or sense of humour. The packed itinerary became much more tolerable because of his efforts. Lastly, I would also like to thank those at the Senate printing office who, at short notice, have done a splendid job. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WF4">Ms CRAWFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report which has just been tabled was released out of session on 2 February 1993, prior to the dissolution of the previous Parliament. The recommendations are not necessarily the views of the current committee, although I am sure the members of the committee would agree with most of the findings in the report. The report deals with strategies for early intervention for literacy and learning for Australian children. The committee's findings and recommendations should ensure that all but a tiny number of children will leave primary school with adequate skills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A vast amount of interest has been shown in the area of the literacy skills of children since the committee's inquiry began in May 1992. The committee received hundreds of submissions, the majority of which were from primary schools which were concerned about the numbers of children not gaining adequate literacy skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many adults with literacy problems were once children with literacy problems. It is appropriate, therefore, that this inquiry followed from the committee's earlier report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Words at work:</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A report on literacy needs in the workplace</EMPHASIS>. That inquiry concluded that all students have the right to be literate when they leave school, regardless of their economic or social backgrounds, and that it is the responsibility of schools to see that this happens. A basic grounding in literacy is an essential prerequisite for future learning. Children with learning difficulties must be identified in the first years of schooling, and appropriate strategies must be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State and Territory education authorities variously estimated that between 10 and 20 per cent of children in the early years are in need of support through early intervention strategies for literacy. These figures, which have been somewhat controversial, are based on discussions which we had with a whole range of people who came before our committee. Those figures were very consistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry, the committee talked to teachers and principals in each State. It is apparent that central education authorities do not realise the extent of the problem. The special needs of some groups are recognised, such as children from Aboriginal and non-English speaking backgrounds, but the system fails to realise that some children, irrespective of background, experience difficulties in learning to read and write in English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area of early education needs to be better resourced. We have made enormous demands upon our teaching force. Indeed, one has to ask why the funding per student for secondary or higher education students is higher than the funding per student for primary school children. Why do we spend $4,000 per student per year in the high school sector, $10,000 plus per student per year in the tertiary sector, but only $3,000 per student per year in the primary sector? Surely one would assume that the needs and demands of younger children who are less independent should be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that our youngest children are almost invisible when it comes to the funding of these sectors. The committee, therefore, has recommended that funding arrangements for the school sectors be revised and that funding of the primary school sector be increased over the next three financial years to at least the per student funding levels of the secondary sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increased funding will allow restructuring of the primary school sector. That funding has essentially remained the same for the last 50 years. The archaic structure results in impractical expectations of primary school teachers who are responsible for teaching across the crowded curriculum with limited non-contact time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, primary school teachers are quick to point out that any problem that arises in the community is automatically put upon the school. People say, `The school can do it. The teachers can do it'. While some schools have employed specialist librarians, music, art and physical education teachers, changes to the primary school structure have not been made in any systemic way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee maintains that innovative structures and teaching strategies can be achieved only with adequate resources. For most schools, current funding and staffing levels leave them with the choice of maintaining the traditional structure or employing specialist teachers and increasing class sizes to unacceptable levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended that the Government finance a three-year pilot research program in primary schools to investigate and assess the effects of enhanced staffing arrangements, which do not reduce class size but which allow for specialisation and the provision of non-teaching time. Teacher aides who work in the classroom alongside the teacher seem to improve the literacy outcomes of children. The committee has recommended an investigation into the effects of the use of teacher aides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee accepts the argument that no single teaching strategy or methodology works for all children. In fact, the majority of teachers use a range of strategies, adapting them to meet the needs of individual children. It is essential that teachers know which methods are likely to work with certain children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current pre-service education may not fully equip students for their role as effective classroom teachers. The committee found it disturbing that teachers of our youngest children no longer require special training, and early childhood courses are no longer compulsory. Also language and literacy components in primary teacher courses are often only a small part of the course. In typical diploma and degree courses, English language and literacy studies currently constitute one-seventh of the total program. The committee has recommended that teacher training be increased to four years, that literacy and language be a compulsory component and that all new teachers be trained in early education and undertake a unit of special education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A disturbing factor regarding teachers was that many student teachers had poor literacy skills themselves. The committee considers that students entering teacher education courses should have a demonstrated efficiency in English and maths and an aptitude for teaching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ideally, all children should be screened for difficulties in literacy learning prior to or at the time of entry to primary school. The committee believes that screening should be done not only by teachers but also by health professionals, such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech pathologists, medical officers and social workers. Unfortunately, in some areas we found that the opportunities to have children screened are negligible or too expensive, or that the facilities are so limited that some of these people may visit a school only once every couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The normal form of student assessment in schools is teacher observation against a checklist of attainments, which is an essential and effective part of teaching literacy. The form of assessment and the action taken on the results, however, were found to be inconsistent and fragmented. Indeed, in New South Wales, which does systemic testing, no action was taken upon the results which occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended that standard assessment tasks be developed which will integrate standardised pen and paper tests with performance measures undertaken by teachers as part of the day-to-day classroom practice. The prime purpose of assessment should surely be the improvement of teaching strategies for the children. Indeed, children who have potential learning problems must be placed in appropriate intervention programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended the introduction of two system-wide literary strategies. First steps, from Western Australia, is a whole class strategy which has proven successful. It is a literacy and learning class-based program targeted to support language development, especially in the early years of schooling. The program is based on a continuum of student development and the child's progress is monitored throughout the year and from year to year. First steps also provides in-service training and support for teachers. The committee was impressed with the enthusiasm of teachers and parents for the program and believes that the first steps program is an exciting development in the teaching of reading and writing to all young children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other program, reading recovery, is a program that is directed to an individual child who is experiencing difficulty at the end of one year of schooling. The lowest literacy performers in a class have intensive daily instruction in addition to classroom instruction. The committee received many submissions from primary schools and enthusiastic parents of children who had benefited from reading recovery. The committee is satisfied with the evidence of the success of reading recovery, despite some criticisms of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that first steps and reading recovery are effective programs and has recommended that the guidelines to the Commonwealth Government's school-based equity programs be revised to ensure that funds are directed to their introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the committee believes that we need a nation dedicated to universal literacy&mdash;every Australian must be able to read and write in English; a national commitment to effective literacy education from the beginning years; appropriate resources for our early education years; highly trained and motivated teachers; teacher training and practice that embraces a range of strategies; and effective strategies for remediation where necessary. We cannot accept that large numbers of children will fail to learn to read and write at school. We are convinced that all but a small number can become successful readers and writers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank my deputy chairman, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), and other members of the committee who worked enormously hard and long. I particularly thank our secretary, John Cummins, who soldiered on under sometimes difficult circumstances. To Susan Cardell and Kerry Warner, who were workers on the committee, thank you very much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe the report reflects the former committee's belief that the literacy needs of our young Australians are critical to the development of the Australian community and must be given the very highest priority.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view this report represents the most significant contribution to the debate on literacy in Australia's history. There is no doubt that we have major problems with respect to early childhood literacy development. During the last parliament this committee, in its first report, inquired into and reported on literacy problems in the adult work force. During that inquiry I took the opportunity to ask every witness who appeared before the committee if we were still growing the problem or if, in fact, it was a problem that existed only in the adult community. I have to say that the teacher representatives, the union representatives and the bureaucracy representatives all said, `No, we do not have any existing problem in our school structure. We are not growing the problem'. However, a number of individual teachers, a number of literacy experts, a number of university professors and lecturers and a number of private citizens said that we have a very real problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that inquiry I pressed hard for the committee to go back and look at early childhood literacy development. The Minister agreed to that and it has resulted in this report. There are a number of major problems that we face with respect to early childhood literacy development. There has been a great deal of work done around the world in trying to come to grips with what the links are that transfer knowledge of the symbols that we use to represent language on a piece of paper through the mind and into speech, which then can be interpreted by someone at a remote place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is that transfer of information from speech to the printed word which no-one has ever truly defined the mechanisms of. When we go to impart the knowledge of how to read, how to write and how to spell to young children we encounter difficulty in methodology in trying to come to grips with how best to make their sight and speech patterns work in what is really not a natural habit at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We learn to speak naturally because we hear as we grow our parents speak and we hear others in the community speak. There is no similar mechanism with respect to reading. It is not habit that teaches us to read but the conventions that are transferred from the spoken sound into letters and combinations of letters which then we transfer back into sounds again. It is that link which is so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that our teachers teach our young children how to read. If there is one critical aspect of primary schooling it is that we give children the opportunity at skills development which allows them at an early age to be able to read, to write, to speak, to spell properly and use structured grammar in a proper manner, and that they are grounded well and truly in these basic skills. It is certainly axiomatic that it is impossible that a child in grade 6 will be an excellent scholar in history if that child cannot read. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report in summary made seven major observations and I think it is important that we look briefly at them. The first of those is that the committee believes that we need a nation dedicated to universal literacy, that every Australian must be able to read and write in English. That is so important. In this day of modern communications it becomes increasingly important that we fail not one child because if that child cannot read and cannot write then that child surely has no opportunity to progress and to participate both in home life and in society in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about equal opportunity. I will say that we really do our worst by our young children if we allow them to grow up without those skills. We need a nation dedicated to literacy and we have got to make it a priority. This report says that it is possible that 20 per cent of our young children at grade 3 or age seven have inadequate literacy skills, that they are either functionally illiterate or that their skill development is behind the development of their peers and they are at risk&mdash;at risk of failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the committee has said that we need a national commitment to effective literacy education from the beginning years. It is certainly true that it must start at an early age and that it starts in the home. It would be terrific if we could come into this chamber and write a rule that says that young children should have their television access limited so that they have time to take more interest in reading real books instead of spending their time in front of the box hour after hour, day after day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we cannot do that because this is a free society. So in some manner we must convey to parents that their role in their children's development is critical and that, if they participate with their children at an early age in reading simple books, in understanding sight and sound relationships and in experiencing the beauty and the warmth in the imagination that develops from reading, then they will have served their children well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we then take those children who have a rich background in reading into school and the teachers are properly trained in how to teach young children how to read and they follow through on that, and if we then determine whether or not they have succeeded or if they need more help, then we will advantage those children well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has said that we need appropriate resources for education in the early primary years. The thing that became abundantly clear is that the differential between spending per child in early primary years and the spending per child in secondary years is almost a national disgrace. For some reason we seem to think that, because they are little, because they do not have a loud voice and they have no political lobby group, our littlies do not deserve as much as those who are older. Well, we are wrong and we have got to fix it and it will take time, but we need the political will in this place to convince our colleagues at State government level that we have to address that spending differential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said that we need highly trained and motivated teachers. That is certainly true. The committee took evidence in case after case that good teachers use a great range of strategies and methodology; they encourage their students and they teach them actively. They are the successful ones. As in any walk of life, as in any profession, there are those who are poor, those who are moderate or mediocre and those who are terrific. It will always be thus, but we need to do a better job, as the chairman of our committee pointed out earlier, in universities and training colleges in teaching teachers how to teach young children the basics of literacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said that teacher training and practice must embrace a range of strategies including structured skill acquisition. In both inquiries we did find evidence that, as we moved to the whole word approach in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Australia, in some respects and in some States and in some systems we overbalanced, one might say. We went from one side of the canoe to the other so swiftly that we just about toppled over because we forgot that one of the basics of language teaching is a structured understanding of phonics, the sounds of letters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said that we need effective strategies for remediation. My colleague told you what some of those were. Last, we said assessment and reporting of literacy outcomes are important. In that respect I took a dissenting view and the committee itself was unwilling to support me in that I recommended that the Commonwealth Government finance the Australian Education Council for a national assessment of reading, writing and mathematic skill attainment of all primary students to completion of year 3 and that the results of the national assessment be reported. There is no way the community will ever support the increased spending, that I know is necessary, without national testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the committee secretary, John Cummins, Susan Cardell and Kerry Warner for the tremendous work that they did for us in the last parliament and over three very active years and four reports. I thank the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee secretariat, headed by John Cummins and supported by Susan Cardell and Kerry Warner, was, as the honourable member for La Trobe said, very professional, task oriented on the difficult and often misunderstood public agenda matter and extremely supportive of committee members, particularly when hearings and meetings were held interstate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, of course, proven links between lack of educational attainment and long-term unemployment. There are proven links between lack of educational attainment and deviant behaviour. Prisons in this country are noted for the fact that 90 per cent of inmates are functionally illiterate. Other deviant behaviour, like violence, racism, harassment, vandalism, substance and drug abuse and so on, is exacerbated by the lack of success in educational attainment. It is estimated that at least one million adult Australians are functionally illiterate. All of those factors are largely unseen costs but, make no mistake, the costs are enormous and can be estimated not in the millions but in billions of dollars lost or imposed upon the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this nation continues to follow a fixative mode rather than a preventive one to deal with problems that essentially emanate from poor literacy and educational skills, the long-term costs will simply prove to be non-sustainable. Images that we have seen on televisions from overseas&mdash;urban riots in the United States, civil disobedience in the northern cities of the United Kingdom, racial tension in France and Germany&mdash;can and will happen in this country if appropriate action is not taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact that needs to be understood by all in this House and in this country is that the needs of young children are not being taken seriously. In fact, they are often trivialised and undervalued and, if given any acknowledgment, it is by negative comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all appreciate that the main responsibility for funding the education of young children is with the States and not Federal government. However, it would be a cheap and inaccurate shot if blame were merely sheeted home to State governments. The raw figures that apply to funding programs for children in Australia are stark. In the 24 developed countries in the OECD, Australia has the third highest percentage of children, yet, when it comes to expenditure from all sources, not just government, on Australia's children, we have the third lowest expenditure, right down there with Turkey, Portugal, Greece and Luxembourg. That is not a clever recipe for a clever country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that significant achievements have been made by the Commonwealth in the past 10 years: retention rates to year 12 have doubled; university places have increased to a total of 36 per cent, the second highest in the world; and a commitment has been made to vocational training. Commitment to training, in particular, is planned to expand significantly by the year 2000. These achievements are indeed magnificent, yet the very basis and foundation for improved secondary retention rates, expanded vocational training and increased university places is largely totally ignored. I refer to our junior primary and primary schools. They are largely, as I said, the responsibility of State governments but equally ignored by the media, unions, business, church groups and the community, not to mention the vested interests in universities, TAFEs and secondary schools. A million adult Australians who are functionally illiterate, 700,000 of whom are Australian born, did not become illiterate at secondary school, TAFE, university or a labour market program. Adult illiterate Australians were first of all young children&mdash;very young children&mdash;that nearly all sectors have ignored. Commonsense would demand that preventive action is cheaper and more effective than expensive remedial action when it is often too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report tells us that the literacy needs of up to 25 per cent of this nation's children are not being met. That is totally unacceptable. This report points to the cost-effective programs to deal with literacy problems when they occur, hence the early intervention in the junior primary schools by programs such as first steps and reading recovery. Early intervention works. This report tells us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian language and literacy policy states that, while it is necessary to continue to improve the quality of learning for all children, school is not the biggest influence on their lives nor their learning.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement is nonsense. It flies completely in the face of a major longitudinal study conducted by the Inner London Education Authority in 1986 which stated quite categorically: For children between the ages of seven and 11, the effect of schooling can make a substantial difference to a child's future, progress and development and, more importantly, schooling is far more significant than the child's race, sex, age or background.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, schooling for children aged from seven to 11 is the most significant determinant of future success, regardless of race, gender or socioeconomic status.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Conserving biodiversity is one of the greatest challenges of our time. We are part of a complex web of life. No species, no matter how dominant, is independent of all others. The existence of each depends to some extent on the existence of all. By ensuring the survival of all forms of life on earth, we help to secure our own future. Conserving biodiversity is about recognising that species live in ecological communities, and preserving the conditions which allow these communities to continue to exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report I am tabling today is the committee's second report on biodiversity. It brings together the expertise of Australia's foremost authorities on conservation biology and landscape ecology and proposes an action plan to apply this knowledge. The report is not only authoritative; it is timely because governments are under pressure to demonstrate their commitment to the conservation of biodiversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia joined 153 other nations in signing the international convention on biodiversity at the Earth Summit in Rio last June. We have been less successful in finalising our own national strategy to conserve biodiversity, but the Federal, State and Territory governments did agree last December to a national strategy for ecologically sustainable development. One of the goals of this strategy is to protect biological diversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's recommendations have been formulated in the context of these wider policy developments. They provide a path from agreements on paper to action on the ground. Biodiversity can be conserved effectively only if a bioregional approach is adopted. Bioregions identify the ecological communities which need to be protected. A bioregion is a large area with interrelated ecological systems. Scientific factors, not existing administrative boundaries, identify the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report I have tabled today recommends that ANZECC, the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, urgently develop and apply protocols and guidelines for the identification of bioregions on a nationwide basis, and that the Environment Resources Information Network, ERIN, be nominated as the agency responsible for developing standards and guidelines for collecting and recording information which can be used in identifying bioregions and in understanding ecological communities and processes and be given an additional $2.3 million a year for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest threat to biodiversity is the loss and fragmentation of natural habitat as a result of human activity. This threat can be effectively countered by carefully selecting significant examples of ecosystems, declaring them nature conservation reserves and managing them appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worldwide, about 4.5 per cent of the earth's land area has been given some level of protection from development. Much of this area is not managed adequately. Even if it were, it would conserve only a small proportion of the world's biodiversity. If the amount of land set aside for conservation were doubled in size&mdash;that is if 10 per cent of the earth's natural lands were protected&mdash;only half of the biodiversity would be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Protected areas within Australia, where nature conservation objectives are paramount, cover 5.3 per cent of the total land area. Yet a glance at a map shows that, while some ecosystems are fairly well represented, many are not protected at all. Like many other countries, Australia has tended to establish national parks in scenic areas which were not otherwise in demand for human activity. Plant communities on high nutrient soil, however, are very poorly represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also large continent-wide belts of arid and semiarid lands, extending across the Northern Territory and four States, which are not represented in protected areas. This is not news to conservationists. For at least 25 years, successive organisations, conferences, individual experts and public inquiries have been calling for Australia's protected area system to be made more ecologically representative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments have expanded the number and size of our national parks during this period, but it is still easy to produce a list of ecological communities which urgently require adequate protection. I have already mentioned arid zone communities. There is also a need to protect grasslands, grassy woodlands, herb fields, dry forest on fertile soil, coastal heath, the brigalow belt, estuarine and brackish wetlands, and subtropical and temperate mangrove systems. The list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without immediate action, some of these communities will be lost forever. Of the 250,000 hectares of grassland that once spread from Canberra to the Victorian border, less than one per cent remains as natural grasslands today. Over 40 per cent of the forest types in the north-east of New South Wales have little or no representation in protected areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considered the idea of recommending the IUCN target of 10 per cent of land in protected areas, but it rejected it. The amount of real estate preserved for natural conservation does not necessarily indicate how effectively biodiversity is being preserved. Instead, the committee has recommended that at least 80 per cent of the identified ecological communities in each bioregion should be represented in highly protected areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended a six-year program to significantly expand Australia's national park system. Working through the ministerial council, the Commonwealth would provide the States and Territories with $100 million over six years, on a two for one basis&mdash;giving a total of $150 million&mdash;specifically to protect ecosystems which are not yet adequately represented in our national parks and reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report identifies scientific principles which should be applied in selecting effective reserve networks within bioregions with minimal disruption to existing land uses. It stresses that the competing demands and aspirations of the community must be accommodated, where possible, without forfeiting the goal of preserving biodiversity. The committee has also recommended that, in conjunction with the land acquisition program, the Commonwealth should provide a further $50 million to meet the cost of establishing new reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant development in park management is that the expertise of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders is now finally being widely acknowledged. The report addresses many of the issues concerning the involvement of Aboriginal people in nature conservation, and the link between traditional knowledge, culture and land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended a national policy framework for the joint management of protected areas, and an administrative framework for assisting Aboriginal and Islander communities generally in managing their land. I urge the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to take up these ideas, which emanated from the communities themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report was released three months ago. It was supported by all committee members. Recently, it was endorsed by the Species Survival Commission which has suggested that the solutions envisaged by the committee are relevant to other countries. State and Territory conservation Ministers have indicated support and there is such interest in the report in the United States that the University of Chicago Press has indicated that it would like to publish it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was delighted last December when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) committed the Government to implementing a bioregional approach to the identification of protected areas. He also pledged $14 million over four years to maintain and expand protected areas. That funding is very welcome but it is not enough. It is little more than the NSW Parks Service alone gets each year for land acquisition and management. I urge therefore the Government to accept the committee's proposals and demonstrate that its commitment to protecting biodiversity is sincere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report was drafted with superb facility by Lindy Smith and David Brunckhorst with the help of Marlene Lyons. Their intelligent, thoughtful commitment was the key factor in enabling completion of the report before the previous Parliament was dissolved. All members of the committee worked together particularly cooperatively and effectively in preparing what we consider to be a crucial strategy for ensuring the survival of Australia's unique ecosystems. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the report of the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts on biodiversity, the role of protected areas. I was not on this committee during the inquiry but have come onto it as Deputy Chairman in this term of the Parliament. However, I do want to make some comments in regard to this report which is now before the Parliament, brief though they may be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, in regard to the Parliament, we have a report like this which is talking about the importance in Australia for us to recognise the natural web of life which occurs within Australia. It makes me reflect on the fact that the Australian Academy of Science actually put out a text book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Web of Life</EMPHASIS>, back in the mid 1970s. Australian young people have been taught about the web of life in biology courses at high schools for at least 15 to 18 years prior to the Parliament actually bringing in a report like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects the Parliament is following where the educators have already been. But this report does recognise that there is a need in Australia for us to have a coordinated approach between the Commonwealth and the States. Also, in this report we refer to involving the community in ensuring that this actually happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this way it is an exciting report because it does bring together all levels of involvement&mdash;Commonwealth Government, State Government and people at the community level. When we talk about the web of life or bioregional frameworks or ecological systems we have to recognise that everybody has to be involved if it is going to be effective. Particularly when we have a federal system of government there is this need for everybody to come to an ownership of a concept like this so that when we find an ecological system crossing over a State border, then we do get coordinated effort between those States that are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, when the State boundaries were drawn up there was not very much thought given as to whether they crossed over ecological sustainable areas or not. That was irrelevant, it was a line on a map. This report recognises the fact that we need to be good stewards of our natural environment. I think many of us, on reflection, would say that we could have done it a lot better in the past. However, our responsibility as a Parliament is to make sure that we do it to the best of our knowledge and ability in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It indicates to the Parliament the amount of money that we feel is important in sustaining this set-up, the framework for having bioregions and so on. So we believe that this report is something which government, hopefully at both Commonwealth and State levels&mdash;the respective Ministers&mdash;will look at and grab hold of in the belief that it can be a major contribution to a sustainable diversity of fauna and flora living within the bioregions throughout Australia so that we are not left with the feeling that some species will become extinct through the activities of human beings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what it is about&mdash;it is about keeping up the genetic diversity that has been given to us in this great nation of ours. It is about being good stewards of what we have. Some has already been lost but what we have we ought to try to keep. To do that we ought to make sure our decisions are based on scientific evidence. If the Parliament allows scientific evidence to dictate in these areas and we keep the emotional side out of it, I am sure we will come to a very reasoned position, and that reasoned position will give security to the flora and fauna of this country. From that, all of us will benefit and we will enjoy that benefit, whether it is the beauty of the plants or whether it is the excitement which we get from many of the animals we have in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As someone coming on to this committee, I say that I think it is an exciting report and I encourage the Government to adopt the recommendations. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Biodiversity: the role of protected areas</EMPHASIS>, follows on from the report into the role of community based programs completed in June last year. There is a lot of interest in these matters in my electorate. In fact, some 55 per cent of all New South Wales endangered species are contained within the subtropical rainforests and other ecosystems of the Tweed Valley in northern New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout both of the ERA committee's inquiries three fundamental elements emerged as essential for action to maintain biodiversity and ecological processes. These are a bioregional approach to planning, an ecologically representative reserve system and community involvement. These elements are also vital to the national ecologically sustainable development strategy to which all governments have agreed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important aspect of the recommendations focuses on the need for quantifiable and accurate information. I would like particularly to commend the work of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service's environmental resource information network, ERIN. A key recommendation is to increase funding to ERIN from $2.3 million per annum to $4.6 million in the 1993-94 financial year. This would allow ERIN to extend its network, to increase its efforts in data collection and validation and to provide support to the States and the Territories to enable them to implement a bioregional framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is in an enviable position in world terms. We still have the capacity to preserve a breadth of bioregional ecosystems that would be exceedingly difficult in the continents of Europe and North America, where population pressures have already played havoc with many fragile ecosystems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In northern New South Wales we have seen the near destruction of the big scrub forests through years of farming and clearing. Community action, as identified in this committee's last report, has gone some way towards redressing this. The big scrub forest remnants are being repaired and nurtured and Commonwealth funding, through Greening Australia, is helping. As this current report recognises, information gathering by Greening Australia is playing a vital role in this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report recommends that the Commonwealth set as a minimum target the representation of at least 80 per cent of bioregional ecosystems in core protected areas by the turn of the century. It is recommended that the Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, ANZECC, establish a specific purpose task force to facilitate, through a bioregional framework, the identification, development and consolidation of a nationwide system of ecologically representative areas. I commend this report's recommendation that the Commonwealth provide $100 million over six years to establish a tied grants program specifically to acquire identified areas to consolidate the establishment of such a nationwide system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, I would encourage the adoption of the recommendation to include the participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is hoped that the draft national biodiversity strategy will be revised to reflect the complexity and sensitivity of seeking to identify unused Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge and practices in biodiversity research and conservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier, I referred to the complex nature of the biodiversity in my electorate and, in the time allocated, I would like briefly to refer to that. In my electorate, there are some 13 species of plants, which fall within the 20 most rare and endangered plants in New South Wales. It is this concentration of biodiversity in small pockets and refuges which makes protection of our nation's flora and fauna both practicable and essential. It should not be forgotten that most modern drugs and chemicals are based on, or are based on synthesis from, natural compounds. Our future prosperity and, indeed, possibly our continuance on this planet is inextricably linked to biodiversity. Until we thoroughly understand all the links and interrelationships within the web of life, as mentioned by the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), it is logical that we should exercise a degree of caution by preserving our nation's, and indeed the planet's, biodiversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proclamation of world heritage areas, such as those within the Richmond electorate, is but one of the many steps required to protect our biodiversity. Already we are seeing the considerable success that ecotourism enterprises can generate. Our biodiversity is being recognised more and more as an economic asset and the future will only serve to raise this importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to the staff of the committee,  to David Brunckhorst, Lindy Smith and Marlene Lyons, for their assistance. In summing up, I refer to the comments made, quite rightly, by the honourable member for Braddon in regard to the involvement of all levels of government and the community in the preservation of biodiversity. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the environment committee commenced its work in the area of biodiversity some two years ago, `biodiversity' was a word that perhaps was not widely understood in the community. Indeed, I can recall my very first contacts with it on the committee. We actually spent some time ourselves trying to define what the term actually meant and what its significance was to Australia. One of the successes and one of the achievements of the two years of work that the environment committee has put into this particular field has been an enhancement of the community understanding of biodiversity issues and the importance of these matters for the future of our country. Indeed, it has enhanced community understanding of our responsibilities as this generation of custodians to hand on to future generations a proper representation of the biodiversity of our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a lot of people associated with this work over the two years and, as the new committee has commenced its work in this Parliament, it is perhaps of note that many of the people associated with this report are no longer part of the committee. I begin by paying tribute to some of the former members of the committee, particularly Mr Webster, Mr Dubois, Mr Edwards, Mr Scott and Mr Fisher, all of whom have not returned to this Parliament and so will not be continuing their work on the committee. I mention, particularly, Mr Webster, the deputy chairman of the committee, who put a great deal of effort into the committee and who regarded environmental issues of great significance. His contribution to the committee will, of course, be missed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention my former colleague Peter Fisher, who has the remarkable record of 13 years of service to the committee. This will obviously be the last report to which he will be attached, as well. Peter put a lot of time and effort into the environment committee's work. He attended regularly and was involved in all of the inquiry's activities. I mention the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who are also not continuing on the committee for various reasons. We compliment Mrs Gallus on her promotion in the area of environment. I know that her interest in this area will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While paying tribute, I mention the previous chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Grayndler (Ms McHugh), who began as committee chair when we were working in the biodiversity field and who continues her interest in that area. There have been a lot of people involved in the preparation and development of this report, but I want to refer particularly to Dr David Brunckhorst, our technical officer and leading adviser in the field. He came for one report and stayed for two, and certainly helped, with his personal knowledge, to enhance the work of the committee. I mention Lindy Smith, who is also no longer with the committee, and Marlene Lyons, who is still with the committee, and thank them for the way in which they facilitated the work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, an involvement with and the development of a proper policy in the area of biodiversity is about more than just land acquisitions. It is true that we need to have representative areas, and the target set by the committee involves 80 per cent of our bioregions, but it is also important that we devote adequate resources to the management of these regions. It is not true to say that once the land has been acquired it can just be neglected and it will take care of itself. True, nature has great powers of healing and great powers to regenerate and rebuild itself, but we certainly need, as a country, to devote resources so that we can adequately manage the areas that we put aside as national parks and for national enjoyment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad that there are often conflicts that develop in relation to the acquisition of new areas. These are often urban and rural conflicts. Those who live in an area do not always appreciate its qualities because they have been there all their lives. Perhaps they have also put in a great deal of their own efforts to care for it and to ensure that it is adequately preserved, so that sometimes they resent the intrusion. On the other hand, urban visitors to an area that they seldom see may have a heightened admiration of what our country has to offer. It is important that these sorts of issues be resolved, that we each recognise the importance of an area to others, and that there is a recognition of the economic contribution that some of these areas are making. We have a national responsibility also to recognise everyone's interest in that regard. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report from the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts is the second of two on biodiversity, and it brings out very clearly the need to maintain biodiversity, a bioregional approach and community involvement. Having said that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I just say how much I enjoyed the time that I spent on the environment committee and I know you too were a part of that committee for some of that time. The memories that I take away from the committee will stay with me for the time that I am in Parliament. I pay tribute to the present head of the committee, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), who joined us on the last excursion we had. I remember very clearly my first impression of the new chairman: he got off the plane in some wilderness area in Western Australia, disappeared with his binoculars and was never seen again until the plane was revved up ready to go, when he emerged from the trees exactly at the right moment with his binoculars in hand. I think every bird in the area had been observed during that time.</PARA></TALK.START>

There was no radio on the boat and only one technician, who was both the captain of the boat and the repairer of the engines. We had one engine that was still going. As we putted along at a very slow rate heading for the mainland&mdash;which we would likely reach at about 2 o'clock in the morning&mdash;the boat captain had to repair the engines. He put the then member for Mallee, Mr Fisher, in charge of the boat and said, `Head towards the sun', and pointed to this large red orb in the distance. There was Mr Fisher heading towards the sun as the then member for Macquarie, Mr Webster, was down with the captain trying to fix the engine. We were all watching with bated breath to see what would happen when a small voice came from Mr Fisher sitting at the controls, and it said, `But what happens when the sun goes down?'. </PARA>

They took us all around Australia to some of its most beautiful places, made sure we got there on time and supplied substitute aircraft when the ones we were on broke down.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, anger: I was angry that after 18 years of bloodshed, terror, torture and abuse suffered by East Timorese, 18 years of resolutions by the UN General Assembly and Security Council and other arms of the UN and 18 years of pontificating, posturing and preaching by a variety of national and international figures, Indonesia is still able to get away with thumbing its nose at the world while maintaining its chains of bondage around the territory of East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also frustrated that all the efforts of the many caring and compassionate people around the world who are genuinely seeking a fair resolution to this matter have not been able to advance the cause one inch. I was ashamed that my own party, along with our Opposition colleagues when they were in government, had allowed these actions to continue and had given official recognition to an act of invasion and a reign of terror. I was despairing for the thousands of East Timorese who still today live in fear because of the continuing repression and physical abuse that are the hallmarks of Indonesia's military occupation of East Timor. But, overwhelmingly, I was determined to maintain my efforts to pursue a just and lasting peace and resolution which fulfils the aspirations of the East Timorese people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion before the House today seeks to highlight the most recent international expression of opinion about Indonesia's policies in controlling East Timor. It joins a very long line of other resolutions, actions and decisions, severely criticising the Indonesian Government for maintaining a regime of official abuse, torture and murder, to control the population of East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia is probably second only to South Africa for racking up condemnatory resolutions around the world about its actions in East Timor&mdash;and that is not a very good record to achieve. The international community has once again expressed the view that the United Nations should insist on gaining access to the disputed territory to examine and report on the questions of torture, extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, arbitrary detentions and disappearances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the Australian Government finally agreed to support this resolution at the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, in contrast to its previous position where it had tried desperately to prevent Indonesia's activities from being placed under the international spotlight. If, as Indonesian propaganda would have us believe, the situation in East Timor is now normal and there is little unrest or disturbance by resistance forces, why will Indonesia not allow objective, international investigators in to examine the situation? The reason, of course, is that there is still a lot to hide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia must follow up its support for this resolution with some concerted efforts to achieve its implementation. It is very disappointing to witness the Australian Government&mdash;my government&mdash;now appearing to back-pedal from its previous commitment. I have constantly been advised that our positive relationship with the Indonesian Government enables us to have some influence over its actions and activities on human rights issues. I am afraid I have seen little evidence of the truth of this claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Indonesian authorities treat our protestations and pleadings with contempt and ridicule. I have not witnessed any lessening of the chains of bondage around, or the continuous harassment and abuse of, East Timorese people because of our special relationship. In fact, the last 18 months have probably been the worst in a decade for the inhabitants of this territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members of the arrests, beatings, torture and murder of hundreds of East Timorese that both preceded and followed the November 1991 Dili massacre. I remind honourable members of the massacre itself; the killing of over 100 innocent, unarmed civilians by Indonesian troops at Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili. I remind honourable members of the arrest and jailing of some of the East Timorese involved in these protests, and of the farcical slap on the wrist meted out to the troops who perpetrated this massive crime. I remind honourable members of the arrest, torture, trial and sentencing to life imprisonment of the East Timorese resistance leader Xanana Gusmao. Where have Australia's efforts had any impact on this record?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia does not support or respect human rights. Its political system is a mockery of democracy. Its military exercises unfettered power throughout Indonesian society. Its judicial system is a joke that denies any semblance of fairness or natural justice. Its continuing suppression of dissent and its ruthless use of violence and intimidation is contrary to all international conventions and treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Xanana Gusmao has now been sentenced to life imprisonment for fighting for freedom for his people. East Timor was invaded by Indonesian troops in December 1975 and has been militarily occupied and suppressed since that time. Gusmao is a political prisoner&mdash;a leader of his people seeking justice, fair treatment and self-determination for East Timorese. Will Australia's good offices with Indonesia help Xanana Gusmao gain his freedom?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time for Australia and the other signatories to the UN Commission on Human Rights to back their words and protestations with some definitive action. Pleas for reconciliation will continue to fall on deaf ears in Indonesia, unless they are backed up by hard economic consequences. Due to its treatment of Xanana Gusmao and its continuing repression, Indonesia should no longer enjoy the respect of the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Indonesia fails to accede to the demands of the resolution of the UN Commission on Human Rights and the previous resolutions over the past 18 years of the General Assembly and the Security Council, it should be suspended from membership of the United Nations. The UN Security Council should act towards Indonesia in the same way that it has acted towards South Africa, Iraq, Yugoslavia and the Khmer Rouge when they have failed to implement Security Council decisions. It should impose economic sanctions against Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that nothing less than this response will force Indonesia to the negotiating table to resolve the question of East Timor. Does Australia have the courage of its convictions on the importance of human rights and the commitment to the right of self-determination, as demonstrated in our position in other international conflicts, to stand up to Indonesia on this matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my comments with some extracts from Xanana Gusmao's defence plea to the Dili district court, a plea he was refused permission to deliver by the mockery of a legal system operating in Indonesia. He pleads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The question of East Timor is the responsibility of the international community, a question of international law. It is a case in which universal principles are at stake, a case where the decolonisation norms of the UN have been manipulated, a case where Indonesia has disregarded the resolutions of the UN, a case therefore of the flagrant violation of the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement, and of the universal pattern of law, peace and justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) This court claims that it is trying me for crimes committed against the Indonesian State and for the illegal possession of firearms. I know that everything has been arranged for me to be convicted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The ones who should be standing before an international court are, in the first place, the Indonesian government for crimes committed in the past 17 years in East Timor; the US administration which gave the green light to the invasion on 7 December 1975 and has since given military aid and political support for Indonesia's genocide in East Timor; the governments of Australia and western Europe for their policy of complicity towards Indonesia; and finally, the Portuguese government for its grave irresponsibility in the decolonisation of East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN recognises as legitimate all means of opposition to the colonial presence in any part of the world where people are fighting for liberation. My struggle and the resistance of my people and of Falintil. . . should be placed in this context, standing above Indonesian law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) . . . the UN does not recognise Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor, a sovereignty which was imposed by the means of force, by the practice of violence and the systematic violation of the most fundamental human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) I appeal to the international community to understand that it is time to show that the New World Order is about to begin. This requires acts that will bring to an end the situation inherited from the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) I appeal to all friends of East Timor, parliamentarians from Europe, America, Japan and Australia, to go on pressing their own governments to change the double standards applied to similar cases where systematic violations of UN resolutions occur, as in the cae of Indonesia's behaviour regarding East Timor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support some of the sentiments expressed in the motion before the House. I was rather intrigued at the praise for the Government expressed in the motion, because the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), in his speech, actually took a more robust line in relation to his attitude towards his government's performance in this area and, I think, a more correct line than he did in the motion before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do join with the honourable member for Moreton in the expressions that he has used, because we all remember that several weeks after the Dili massacre in November 1991, many members from both sides of this House rose to condemn the actions of the Indonesian Government in relation to that incident. It is often forgotten that some of the first boat people&mdash;in fact, the first boat people&mdash;to Australia, were people from East Timor bumping ashore in Darwin all those many years ago. A lot of people think that they were Indo-Chinese refugees, but in fact they were not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who have had a longstanding interest and involvement in human rights issues were, and still are, appalled by the repeated human rights abuses sustained, over a very long period of time now, by the East Timorese people. I do not think there is any doubt that it is very clear by international standards that human rights had been breached in East Timor, and that Australia&mdash;quite legitimately&mdash;had a right to join in international condemnation of the actions of the military in its treatment of the citizens of East Timor on 12 November. This we did, without apology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian Government undertook an inquiry into the matter, and it is fair to say that many people were not very happy with the results of that inquiry. It was a step forward, but a fairly small step forward. Obviously, that step has got to be accelerated very greatly in the future. That inquiry concluded that the Indonesian troops overreacted to the demonstration. I think that is a nice way of putting it: `overreacted to the demonstration'. There were well over 100 people killed&mdash;shot, as the honourable member has mentioned&mdash;defenceless people. It certainly was an overreaction to the demonstration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of that inquiry was that 10 soldiers were sentenced to up to 18 months in gaol for their role in the shootings. East Timorese involved in the demonstrations, by contrast, received sentences of from five years to life. We brought this matter up when we visited Indonesia last year as part of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. On a number of occasions we had the opportunity to raise with Indonesian authorities the extraordinary discrepancy in the sentencing of the civilians as against the military. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his visit to Indonesia in May 1992 the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that when speaking with President Suharto he repeated the Australian Government's view that the Indonesian Government's response to the Dili killings had been a credible one. But international concern about continued human rights abuses in East Timor led the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to move a resolution expressing its deep concern at the reports of continuing human rights violations in East Timor. That resolution, as we know, was passed by 22 votes to 12 on 10 March 1993. Unfortunately, that was not a majority of the votes; it was a majority of those who voted but, unfortunately, there were a lot of abstentions and it was not a majority of all the people who had the opportunity to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution was, among other things, gravely concerned about continuing allegations of serious human rights violations and noted with concern, in this context, the reports of the special rapporteur on the question of torture, of the special rapporteur on extra judicial summary or arbitrary executions and of the working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances. These are very serious concerns, and I joint with the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in congratulating the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for adopting the resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then have to again draw attention to the second part of the honourable member's motion, where he does congratulate the Australian Government. The Australian Government was involved. It did add a rider to its vote&mdash;and I agree with it&mdash;which said that it would have been better if there had been a greater joining in the voting to ensure that there was a majority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I draw the attention of the House once again to the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on a review of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights, which was tabled in this Parliament in December of last year. The members of that committee had the opportunity over several months to hear submissions from a very large number of people and a range of groups in relation to events in Indonesia and in East Timor in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section on East Timor, in chapter 6 of that report, really demonstrates the situation there more clearly and in a brief and understandable way. It is a description of the events and the situation there which I commend to all honourable members. I do not think it has received enough attention by the media in this country. In paragraph 6.24 it says the following about the present Australian Government. I inform the House that this is from this agreed committee report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the situation in East Timor, its proximity to Australia and its historic and emotional ties for many Australians and, in particular, the scale of the massacre on 12 November and the injustices done to the victims of that incident, it would seem the incident and its outcome deserve much stronger condemnation. Furthermore, it is important that the Australian Government should be consistent in its reaction to human rights outrages of this kind. Australia has a laudable history of promoting human rights and condemning human rights abuses in distant parts of the world. By softening, as Australia did, the strongly worded resolution on the massacre which was drafted by the European Community, we have lessened our credibility and this, finally, is counterproductive to any future human rights responses we make.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important statement by the joint committee because we have a laudable record on human rights abuses around the world. But when it gets close to home, we get a bit pussyfooted about the whole thing, and this does lessen our credibility both within Australia and, particularly, internationally. It is something which I believe the Government must take much more notice of than has been the case in the past. It is interesting that there was a resolution by the committee in relation to Indonesia. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee urges the Australian Government to support actively a new UN initiative to begin consultations with all the parties to the conflicts in East Timor, Irian Jaya and Aceh with a view to negotiating a settlement, and to draw to the attention of the Indonesian Government the gross injustice of the application of the anti-subversion law to those involved in peaceful protest.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I think that is a measured, responsible report by the joint committee which should be taken most seriously by the Government. I want to join with the honourable member for Moreton in a quote from the defence of Gusmao, which unfortunately was not allowed to be read to the court. He has read one excerpt from that defence; I would like to read another excerpt from it. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the United Nations, Jakarta cannot suppress the fact that Portugal is an interested party in the solution of the problem. And so, Jakarta should also never forget that the Maubere people (the people of East Timor) have already demonstrated that the idea, the objective for which they have fought and resisted to this day can never die. People die but ideas stay alive.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that encapsulates the present situation in East Timor. I am strongly of the view that it would be very much in Indonesia's best interests for it to seek a political settlement to this ongoing festering sore which does a great deal to detract from the international reputation of Indonesia. I have a great deal of regard for the people of Indonesia and I think their progress has been remarkable in so many different areas, but internationally their reputation is being very gravely besmirched by the performance of their Government in relation to East Timor. I once again would urge the Australian Government to take up most strongly with the Indonesian Government the need for a negotiated settlement in relation to this tragic situation in East Timor. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) has quite correctly pointed out that the tone of the mover of this motion today is somewhat more negative than the original motion. We do, of course, commend Australia's role in supporting the resolution mentioned in the motion because it does speak of continuing allegations of serious human rights violations. It notes with concern in this context the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture. It speaks of the improved access by international authorities to prisoners within East Timor, but it remains disappointed that such access is still frequently denied. The resolution of that United Nations body also regrets that the Indonesian investigation into the actions of the members of its security personnel on 12 November 1991, from which resulted loss of life, injuries and disappearances, failed to clearly identify all those responsible for these actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the original resolution that we are supporting is thankful for small mercies, that the Australian Government, which has not had a commendable performance on this particular issue, has seen its way to supporting this United Nations body's resolution. However, these matters have been overshadowed by the sentencing of Xanana Gusmao in the last week. That sentencing followed a fairly discredited judicial process, a situation where a large number of people thought that his original televised confessions and admissions of wrongdoing were perhaps affected by doctoring of television broadcasts, and the fact that he was held incommunicado for 17 days without access by the Red Cross and that there were strong possibilities of torture during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that first statement he came up with amazing comments such as that East Timor is part of Indonesia, and he attacked Jose Ramos Horta as basically treating himself too importantly and not worrying about the Timorese. In that initial statement he basically denounced everything he ever stood for, and the statement which the Indonesian authorities refused to allow in the past week really puts into context that original forced statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Indonesian legal process, of course, also involved a court appointed lawyer. It entailed the refusal of the court to allow the Indonesian legal aid institute access. As many have said, this past week it refused his right to make a defence statement which has been leaked to the rest of the world. So that situation has very much overshadowed the minimal effort that Australia has made in the Commission on Human Rights. The resolution itself represented the culmination of international concern about what the Indonesians have done in Timor since 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1975 we saw an invasion which, on conservative estimates, eventually entailed the murder of 200,000 people. I think the Indonesian Government would accept that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jakarta Post</EMPHASIS> has some credibility. In 1992 the long term impacts of that invasion are shown in figures which indicate that, while the life expectancy of Indonesians is 56 years, that of the East Timorese is 42 years; the female literacy rate is 27 per cent while nationally it is 65 per cent; the infant mortality rate is 166 in 1,000 against 84 in 1,000 throughout Indonesia. That also puts in context Indonesia's constant references to what the Portuguese failed to do for 400 years. There have been improvements in road access, communications and other things which enforced the occupation, but there are grave problems still in the standard of living in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to cite part of the statement which Xanana made, but which, as I say, the Indonesians did not allow to be read. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I acknowledge military defeat on the ground. I am not ashamed to say so. On the contrary, I am proud of the fact that a small guerrilla army was able to resist a large nation like Indonesia, a regional power which in a cowardly fashion invaded us and wants to dominate us by the law of terror and crime, by the law of violence, persecution, prison, torture and murder.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The moment has come for Jakarta to recognise its political defeat on the ground. I don't know if it was to impress me that they placed armed tentaras [soldiers] on the route. . . to the court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been flattered in all kinds of ways in order to convince me to behave here like a docile Indonesian. I have had to behave like one, and the witnesses brought here have also had to behave in that fashion.</PARA>
<PARA>I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak reluctantly in support of this motion. I say `reluctantly' because the resolution of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which the motion endorses, speaks of the `violent incident of 12 November 1991 in Dili'. This is the muted language of diplomacy, yet this incident was in fact a massacre by Indonesian security forces of a large number of innocent, unarmed East Timorese. There can be no justification for what occurred. It is a measure of Indonesia's interest in investigating this crime that it is not known how many people were killed and that those responsible were not all identified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another shameful aspect of the affair was the subsequent trials. East Timorese civilians, not indicted for violent activities, received severe sentences while comparatively moderate sentences were meted out to only a few members of the security forces involved in the shooting. The truth is that the trials were a farce. The perpetrators of the crimes became the judges and declared the victims to be the criminals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations resolution goes on to express `deep concern at the reports of continuing human rights violations in East Timor'. This again is a muted and inadequate reference to torture, summary executions, arbitrary imprisonment and disappearances that are a continuing feature of life for the East Timorese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be stressed that this is not happening in some place conveniently far away, but on Australia's northern doorstep: Timor is closer to Darwin than is Alice Springs. This motion borders on lip service in offering the congratulations of the House to the UN commission for its resolution. The Dili massacre happened 18 months ago; it has taken a long time for the United Nations to make a mildly critical statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential part of the motion concerns the pressure that must be brought to bear on the Indonesian authorities to allow UN officials to properly investigate human rights abuses in East Timor. As a close neighbour and a country with a very public concern for human rights, Australia has to be involved. Australia supported the UN resolution and now it has to follow up with direct approaches to the Indonesian Government to ensure its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to atone for our complicity in what has occurred in East Timor for the last 18 years. The effective appeasement of Indonesia by the governments of the United States, Portugal, western Europe and ourselves has allowed Indonesia to progress from the original invasion to the Dili massacre, and now the subsequent show trials culminating in last week's travesty with the sentencing of the East Timorese leader. It was a trial with all the standard features of the judicial systems of military dictatorships from time immemorial&mdash;the false confession, the stifled defence, the secrecy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of seeming world acceptance of all this, the military dictatorship of Indonesia is now trying to cloak its actions under the guise of cultural sovereignty. The whole concept of human rights, as established under the United Nations Universal Declaration, is now under challenge from Indonesia and other authoritarian regimes in the Asia region in a sinister attempt to justify their actions in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is at issue is the universality and the indivisibility of human rights. The UN conference on human rights to be held in Vienna next month will see an attempt to assert by these regimes that human rights have to be culturally adjusted to meet their society's particular traditions and needs. The regional conference held in Bangkok earlier this year, from which Australia was excluded, challenged the concept of universal human rights based on the primacy of rights of economic development, cultural needs and national sovereignty. If accepted, these self-serving justifications would mean that human rights, recognised as being the right of individuals under international law, could alter according to their nationality and cultural group&mdash;in other words, to provide carte blanche for any authoritarian regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no pretence about this, as the people of Asia have made clear. More than 180 organisations in the Asia-Pacific region have signed a statement endorsing the indivisibility and independence of all human rights. The Government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), has indicated it will support the UN commission at the Vienna conference. Indonesia needs to be clearly told that human rights are universal. They cannot be washed away by the sophistry of cultural sovereignty; neither can bullets, massacres or military dictatorships. </PARA>

<PARA>The visit to Australia by the Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is the first visit of a Vietnamese head of state since the fall of Saigon in 1975 and the tightening of the grip of communism over the peoples of Vietnam. The visit is a very important opportunity for Australia to let Mr Vo know of the serious concerns felt by many Australians&mdash;including, of course, a substantial Australian-Vietnamese community&mdash;about the continuing human rights abuses that are occurring within the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. They need to be addressed. I belatedly understand from the news that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has agreed to discuss these important issues of human rights with Mr Vo during the visit, after much pressure from the Australian-Vietnamese community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many acknowledge Mr Vo as being credited with the resurgence of the Vietnamese economy, after becoming Prime Minister in August 1991. But for many of the 150,000 Vietnamese Australians, the visit is one of some trepidation. Mr Vo's visit for many around Australia brings back painful memories of the oppression of the communist regime from which many of them fled in terror, in particular during the 1970s and the early part of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted on television last night, as I was watching the news, the painful expression, the signs of distress, on the part of one particular member of that community as they re-enacted the placement of prisoners in what was called the `tiger cage' during a demonstration yesterday of some of the techniques of oppression used by the Vietnamese regime against its own people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of those protests from around Australia we are today debating a motion calling for the Vietnamese Government&mdash;whose record of substantial human rights abuse is to be deplored&mdash;to immediately and unconditionally release all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience, including the Venerable Thich Huyen Quang; introduce basic human rights to Vietnam, including freedom of assembly, religious worship and freedom of speech and press and free and open elections; provide for the creation of a pluralist free enterprise economy and demonstrate to the Parliament of Australia how and where aid moneys provided to Vietnam by Australia are spent and how that aid encourages the cultivation of a more democratic and free society in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be many of those in the large contingent of protesters outside Parliament House today who could provide us with examples of allegations of ill-treatment, torture and human rights abuses in their former homeland. They would probably refer to instances such as the case of the 60-year-old poet Vu Hoang Chuong; the writer and mathematician, Ho Huu Tuong; 80-year-old Catholic priest Father Hoang Quynh; lawyer Tran Van Tuyen; and high dignitary of the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam, An Quang Pagoda. These people are alleged to have been punished and tortured as part of that campaign of oppression and terror that is meted out to those that are seen as a threat or in some way contrary to the interests of the communist regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vietnamese communities cite these as examples of how Vietnamese religious communities are the target of government harassment and persecution, in many instances, simply for the quiet, non-violent exercise of their religious beliefs. This is the dark secret of Hanoi, and it is an issue that must not be glossed over during the visit by Mr Vo to Australia. With more than 60 million adherents to the Buddhist faith in Vietnam it is fundamental to their human rights that they are able to practise their religion in freedom from persecution or harassment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Involving 85 per cent of Vietnam's population, the Buddhist church has deliberately refrained from taking an active involvement in political activities but, after 2,000 years of religious practice, it is unlikely that the campaign of persecution and harassment and the influence of torture or imprisonment would be likely to have intimidated those of that faith and to have prevented them from practising their faith. It is important that we in Australia provide them with the support to ensure that they are provided with the opportunity of practising their faith, free from persecution and harassment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against the backdrop of the background philosophy of socialism, organisations such as Amnesty International, the United Buddhist Church in Vietnam, the Sakyamuni Buddhist Centre and various branches of the Vietnamese community in Australia are calling for the release of all prisoners of conscience. I join them in that call and, of course, also call for the release of the Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, Acting Secretary of the United Buddhist Church in Vietnam and a nominee for the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, who was arbitrarily arrested and tortured in 1977, released then rearrested in 1982 and then banished to his native village, where he is forbidden to exercise the practice of his cherished religion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the basic human right to practise one's religion freely without fear of reprisal must be reinstated, along with the freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and fair and open elections. The reinstatement or provision of those freedoms must occur without delay. The token release of prisoners in a bid to secure Western donor aid is simply not enough. Immediate and lasting reforms are needed to improve Vietnam's much criticised human rights legacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know from our recent social history, the legacy of the Vietnam war, the subsequent torrent of human rights abuses and the Vietnam Government's systematic oppression of many of its people has been a steady flow of refugees to other parts of the world. Many of those refugees who came to Australia have become a very important part of the Australian community. In many cases they have done extremely well in Australia, having qualified themselves to become professionals. They have become doctors, teachers and lawyers, or have opened businesses and instituted community groups, clubs and associations that have become part of the fabric of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, there are two million Vietnamese refugees who have been resettled around the world. Like the 150,000 Vietnamese in Australia they refuse to accept the reign of communism in their former homeland. It is interesting to note that only 15,000 of these Australian Vietnamese have returned to Vietnam to seek out friends and family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn briefly to the reasons for Mr Vo's visit. It is clear that the absence of the involvement of the United States in the Vietnamese economy&mdash;another legacy of the Vietnam war&mdash;has opened the door for Australian investment. By the time the United States lifts its trade embargoes, possibly even within the next few weeks, we will have already had a secure foothold in areas such as telecommunication and oil exploration through the involvement of OTC and BHP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also stand poised to play the role of a peace broker as Vietnam moves to mend fences with its former enemies. In fact, US government advisers believe Canberra could be at the very forefront in advising Washington on many aspects of strategic policy formulation and the normalisation of relations between the two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at this time, while the embargoes remain in place, Australia should be very careful to acknowledge the reasons behind the continuing enforcement of those sanctions by the United States. Like Australia, the United States is a signatory to many international treaties such as the Geneva accord and the Paris peace agreement, which advocate refraining from all acts of reprisal and discrimination against individuals and organisations and ensure their democratic liberties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would refer also to the alleged policy of normalisation, or doi moi, which has been seen somewhat as the perestroika of Vietnam&mdash;an analogy, of course, that does not go hand in hand with the other aspect of perestroika, glasnost, which was, in the case of the former Soviet Union, the movement towards some normalisation of political activity in line with the freeing up of its own domestic economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that we are seeing some freeing up of the Vietnamese economy and opportunities for trading with other nations and, in particular, our own opportunities for trading through our own companies. But it is important that we match this doi moi movement within Vietnam by insisting on the normalisation of human rights and the opportunity for the Vietnamese people to enjoy the same sorts of human rights that we enjoy in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we currently have the Prime Minister of Vietnam, Mr Vo, visiting our country, I believe we should take the opportunity to remind him of his country's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which it is a party. We not only have a duty to remind the honourable Prime Minister of that obligation but I believe we also have a right, a right borne of the closeness of our economic destinies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am very proud to be associated today with the motion moved by my colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), I would disagree with a remark that he made in an otherwise excellent speech. He pointed out to the House that our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is only bringing up human rights with the Prime Minister of Vietnam because of pressure from the Vietnamese community in Australia. As I understand it, that is not true, and I would like to put that on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways Australia has led the way in reintroducing Vietnam to the world community. That effort has not always been easy and it has drawn criticism from many who have long and not unwarranted bitter memories. Criticism has also come from those people for whom the ongoing abuse of human rights in Vietnam is an outrage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me state here that I too feel outrage that the citizens of Vietnam do not enjoy the same freedoms that we enjoy and take for granted. We have the freedom to speak our minds, to express our thoughts, to practise our religions and to choose our government. We have the freedom to take an active part in a shared destiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in spite of the outrage that I feel, I believe a considered response to those problems is what the situation requires. By `considered' I mean that simple opposition to human rights abuse is not enough. More is needed to have a positive effect. And the realities in this situation are that there have been, and there continue to be, unacceptable abuses of basic human rights in Vietnam. I repeat: unacceptable basic human rights in Vietnam. The question is not whether the abuse of human rights is acceptable; quite simply it is not. The question must always be: what is the best course of action available to us that will bring about the change we desire? Our efforts should always be directed towards stopping these abuses and towards assisting the people of Vietnam to become more free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as efforts in assisting the people of Vietnam to become more free, or at least assisting the people of Vietnam to be in a position to become more free, are concerned, I believe the Australian Government and the Australian business people have been playing a vital part. On Tuesday this week, there was an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> which quoted Father Kevin Lee, from St Patrick's Cathedral in Parramatta. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australia's expanding trade and aid links with Vietnam could serve to entrench the power of the Government and that human rights abuses would continue unless Western governments directly challenged the Vietnamese.</PARA>
<PARA>Please do not misunderstand me on this point; I fully support Father Lee's sentiments. However, I disagree with him on the best methods of gaining our desired result in Vietnam. I firmly believe that, rather than restricting us, our expanding trade links in Vietnam give us a greater right to challenge the Vietnamese government about its human rights record. We are doing that today, in debating this motion. The access that our diplomatic and trade ties allow us means that we can continually raise human rights in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, I am running out of time but I would like to reiterate the words of the mover of this motion in encouraging the Vietnamese government to free the people it has in captivity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuing violation of human rights by the Hanoi administration should cast a dark shadow over the visit to Australia by the Prime Minister of Vietnam and prick the humanitarian consciousness of those dealing with him, for we find Vietnam's denial of basic human rights an affront to all humanity. Section 14c of the 1954 Geneva accord called upon all parties:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to refrain from all acts of reprisal and discrimination against individuals or organisations on account of their activities during the conflict, and undertakes to ensure their democratic liberties.</PARA>
<PARA>The Vietnamese government deliberately and consciously impedes the development of a community which respects and values the contribution of the individual and protects individuals from the excess of government control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In impeding the development of a liberal democracy, it continues to contravene not only the 1954 Geneva convention but also the 1973 Paris peace agreement, specifically article 11 of the Paris agreement, which exists to ensure the democratic liberties of the people&mdash;personal freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, free association and organisation&mdash;and numerous other personal, political and economic liberties. These have been denied to the mass of the Vietnamese community. The Vietnamese government had previously pledged its support to both of these documents and today actively works to imprison the people of Vietnam by not allowing them to practise these basic freedoms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we continue to hear tales of the horror inflicted upon those detained in prisons and so-called re-education camps.

The detention of religious leaders by the Vietnamese administration is no myth and that administration's actions in detaining them should not be tolerated or sanctioned by a community&mdash;especially by a community such as Australia which holds the right of free speech and of political and religious tolerance at the base of its social and cultural heritage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An authority born in resolution 297 of 1977, decreed by the Vietnamese Council of Ministers, was in the words of Amnesty International designed to bring religious and cultural activities under the control of the state and the Communist Party by means of a comprehensive set of rules which included restrictions on religious services, religious education and the holding of religious gatherings and retreats. The control over religious activity in Vietnam is so suffocating that one cannot practise openly as a religious priest or minister without first obtaining government approval&mdash;an attitude which would never be accepted in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The human rights question represents the most difficult but most fundamentally important aspect of Australia's relationship with Vietnam. This is made more difficult by the fact that Vietnam's impressive economic growth rate makes it a trading haven for Australia's business interests; Australia has already become Vietnam's biggest foreign investor. The time has come for Australia to balance its economic interests against its pursuit of human rights claims against Vietnam. </PARA>

There are those Australians who, often through no fault of theirs, found themselves engaged in that most vile of all human activities, war, and who today still suffer as a result of that experience in Vietnam. Those of us who were not involved in that type of vile activity but became part of what was known then as the peace movement have different reasons to remember Vietnam, very strong reasons to remember Vietnam; and those who put Australia into that conflict prolonged, in my view, the agony of Vietnam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agony which Vietnam has experienced has been not just in the conflict in which we were involved, but in events well before the Second World War when the French, among others, tried to impose their colonial will. At the end of the Second World War, the British rearmed Japanese prisoners of war and set those prisoners of war back against the Vietnamese people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other powers in the world which thought they could resolve the internal problems of Vietnam by war or conflict only prolonged the great pain that the Vietnamese have now suffered for a long time. The great tragedy of Vietnam today is that the agony continues. I believe there beats in the soul of all of humanity a great need and a great desire for very simple things&mdash;things that we in Australia take very much for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These simple things are as follows: the right of free association; the right to belong to political parties; the right to elect representatives in a free and a democratic political system; the right to an independent judiciary; the right to be represented in a court of law, to be aware of the charges and to have the right of representation; the right of freedom of religion; the right of free travel, not just internationally but also domestically. Many of those are rights which the Vietnamese do not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members, I do not think there can be any dispute that the Australian Parliament supports, not just in Vietnam but around the world, the right of all people to have those very simple and very fundamental rights. It is appropriate when the Prime Minister of Vietnam is in Australia that we in this Parliament remind ourselves, as well as the Vietnamese Prime Minister, of the great difficulty which we had in getting those rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the world and of the development of other countries shows that the rights which we enjoy here in Australia are not always easily obtained. Those rights are very often only obtainable when the economic conditions of a country enable the development of the educative processes which develop those rights. So in many ways the fact that Australia is now entering into economic relations with Vietnam is indicative of the fact that Vietnam is leaving its closed boundaries&mdash;just as the wall came down in Berlin&mdash;and entering the world of other nations, of other viewpoints, of other concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my firm belief that through trade, and through the Vietnamese learning the systems that we have and the ease with which we cope with our freedoms, we will create a desire amongst the Vietnamese leaders to give their people the sorts of freedoms which we enjoy. So, whilst I condemn the total failure of the Vietnamese leaders to abide by the 1973 Paris peace accords, particularly chapter 2, and the fact that they have failed to comply with international obligations and agreements, I hope that through trade and with involvement in world affairs the Vietnamese people will have a much better and freer future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion moved by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) coincides with the visit of the Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Mr Vo Van Kiet. It is important that we debate this motion during his visit, for the motion recognises and deplores the record of the Vietnamese Government on human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is imperative that Mr Vo be made aware that this Parliament disapproves of the way his government has treated the citizens of Vietnam over the last few decades. A new Vietnamese constitution, which was promulgated in 1992, was aimed at improving human rights. An amendment actually stated that `all human rights' are to be respected. However, it seems these changes were cosmetic and, in practice, human rights abuses have continued to occur in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment on a report submitted to the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Relations. The report is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country reports on human rights practices for 1992</EMPHASIS>. It details some specific cases in Vietnam and shows clearly that human rights abuses still exist there. Reading the report, I was astounded at what actually went on&mdash;and obviously still does go on&mdash;and it certainly makes me feel proud to be an Australian. Speaking as we are here today and having the opportunity to speak on virtually anything we wish is something most Vietnamese would not be entitled to do, yet it is something that we here in Australia take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote a number of sections from that report which detail human rights abuses which occurred last year. The abuses include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . severe restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association, on workers' rights, and on the right of citizens to change their government. The government crackdown on dissent begun in the spring of 1990 continued in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to mention particular instances of abuses. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of deaths of political prisoners, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . according to credible reports, prisoners have in the past died of exhaustion, physical abuse, malnutrition, the lack of medical care, and other effects of conditions in prison and re-education camps.</PARA>
<PARA>On torture, and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, the report claims that there continued to be credible and consistent reports of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . police brutality during interrogation . . . (and severe) conditions for those confined in prisons.</PARA>
<PARA>While in Australia fair, open and public trials would be taken for granted, in Vietnam, even in spite of legislative changes aimed at improving them, secret trials are still reportedly being held for some political prisoners. The report also recognises a report by Amnesty International, which organisation has campaigned on behalf of political prisoners from countries such as Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I have detailed examples of human rights abuses, I would now like to talk briefly on the content of the motion moved by the honourable member for Moore. The motion calls on the Vietnamese Government to immediately and unconditionally release all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience. This is very straightforward, and I do not think anyone with any compassion would argue against this. It also urges basic rights to be introduced, including freedom of assembly, religious worship, speech and the press, and free and open elections. Such freedoms are ones which I am passionate about. While changes have recently been made in Vietnam, they have been artificial changes, and past practices have really continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by saying that the motion of the honourable member for Moore is commonsense and straightforward and deserves absolute support. With the Prime Minister of Vietnam present in Australia today, we must demonstrate that Australia's parliamentarians are concerned at his government's appalling human rights abuses, and signal that we want change if Vietnam is to receive aid and if we are to trade freely with Vietnam to help improve the living standards of all the Vietnamese people. This motion is too important to be ignored, and I implore all members to provide their support for it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)notes the increasing vulnerability of Australian clothing manufacturers to counterfeiting and the negative effect that this is having on investment, employment and future prospects of this part of the textiles, clothing and footwear sector;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)notes the amendments to the Trade Marks Act 1955 made last year providing for increased penalties for counterfeiters; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)calls upon the Government, Australian Federal Police and State police forces to consider suitable methods to reduce the damage to the clothing industry's intellectual property that counterfeiting is causing.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion will be ably seconded by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) and supported by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), both of whom have a good understanding of this issue. I also look forward to supportive remarks, I hope, from the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) on this matter, because it also affects his electorate, which is adjacent to mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Counterfeiting of clothing is a theft of Australian jobs. Australia is attempting to reach world-class best practice in many areas and a large number of clothing companies have achieved this, but the counterfeiters debase the manufacturers' hard efforts over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the weekend a friend of mine went to a Sunday market in Belmont in my electorate and she noticed that a stallholder had Hot Tuna and Quiksilver brand T-shirts and polo fleeced T-shirts that were on sale for $25 and $35. My friend said to the stallholder that these garments were fakes. The clothing stayed on display. No doubt many people walking past thought, `What a great price', for what they thought were quality garments. It would have been a different story after a few washes when these counterfeit garments would have fallen apart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Ramsden of the Anti-counterfeiting Action Group represents 18 of Australia's leading clothing manufacturers: names such as Country Road and Palmer Corporation, or Jag as it is better known as, as well as surfwear manufacturers in Torquay&mdash;Rip Curl and Quiksilver. Mr Ramsden says that the Australian clothing industry is losing an estimated $300 million a year through counterfeiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Weekend markets act as a convenient vehicle to dispose of thousands of such garments. Mr Ramsden believes that, unless there is action to reduce counterfeiting, Australia will be less of that `clever country' because quality in clothing will be penalised by these fake garments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clive Fitts, of Quiksilver in Torquay, says that retailers, such as former Geelong footballer Billy Goggin's sports store in the seat of Corio, are often across the street from such markets. Consumers come into the store and wonder why the T-shirt that they bought at the market across the street for $10 costs $35 or $45 in the sports store. The consumers do not understand the $20 million that it has cost Quiksilver to develop its designs and image in the marketplace over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reputable manufacturers have to emphasise quality. They are in a fashion conscious industry; they have to market internationally. Their products are accepted in Europe, in the UK, in California and around the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mark Wiesmayr of Rip Curl says counterfeiting of clothing cheapens Rip Curl's brands. The surfboards, the wetsuits and the beach gear of these Torquay companies have won a worldwide reputation and recognition. Shop retailers become angry because the market stallholders who sell the counterfeit goods have such low overheads. Consumers are not aware that Rip Curl's T-shirts are designed eight months before the summer season and have been extensively tested to see whether the design will give Rip Curl's customers what they want in wear, style, overall quality and performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole argument must focus on the importance of Australia's growing reputation as a nation with design skills. We are increasingly seen as manufacturers of quality clothing products that are winning acceptance in domestic and export markets. This clothing commands a premium price, whether it is fashion or business clothing or surf wear. The garments, designed by professionals over many months and years, are made from high quality yarns and fabrics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Threats to the viability of clothing manufacturers from counterfeiters have to be taken very seriously. These typically backyard operators seek a free ride on the backs of companies such as Quiksilver and Rip Curl in Torquay, which in 20 years have built their businesses from nothing to enterprises employing 100 to 300 staff. The counterfeiters seek to misrepresent their clothing as being as good as that produced by the holder of the trademarks, but the copies have inferior fabrication and printing, and an overall totally inferior quality rating. The reputable manufacturers, who are the victims, have not sought to hide behind a tariff wall. They are out there in the international and local markets trying to sell quality clothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Counterfeiters typically sell these garments through 300 Australia-wide weekend markets. When clothing purchased at the weekend market falls apart later, the reputable manufacturer gets the blame. How is the customer to know that the proper, `original' garments are never sold through market stallholders but only through retail shops and, in a few cases, factory outlets run by the manufacturer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have little argument with the existence of weekend markets. They provide important community benefits through lower prices to consumers for some goods. However, I object most strenuously to the misrepresentation of these counterfeit garments as the genuine article. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This seemingly small problem of a few T-shirts being copied and sold cheaply has now blossomed into a problem that costs Australian clothing manufacturers anything up to the figure given by John Ramsden of $300 million a year. Australian companies, in many cases, are now receiving royalties and licence fees from the internationally accepted clothing that has been designed here. If Australia does not regard intellectual capital as one of its most precious commodities, I fail to see how we can really expect other nations to take seriously our efforts to increase our exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the Parliament finally considered a report into this whole matter. As a result, amendments to the Trade Marks Act 1955 were passed. The penalties for selling a counterfeit garment are now up to $500 for a single offence, with a fine of up to $50,000, or two years imprisonment, for an infringement of a trademark. Will the counterfeiters really be deterred by this level of penalty or should we again look at increasing penalties?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Federal Police have been cooperative in prosecuting. Together with various State police forces, which have jurisdiction over the markets, they have launched some 95 prosecutions. The highest penalty imposed in the courts was in New South Wales earlier this year&mdash;a $4,000 fine and a two-year good behaviour bond. However, Australia needs to do more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March this year John Ramsden, Norm Innis, managing director of Quiksilver, and Mark Wiesmayr from Rip Curl came to see me. They explained how counterfeiting was a major headache and how it took many hours of management time to even partially stem the flood of copied garments into the markets. I then sent a letter to the Australian Federal Police and I am pleased to say that a group, the anticounterfeiting action group, has met with the Australian Federal Police since then. The Australian Federal Police are considering establishing a task force to initiate a greater scrutiny of the counterfeiters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anticounterfeiting action group was set up in November 1990 with 10 members, and the number has now grown to 18. These companies, including their retail operations, directly employ 8,000 staff. Many members are leading the thrust of the clothing industry to have Australia recognised as a quality supplier and retailer of clothing on the world scene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Federal Police may find the best results will come if their resources are concentrated on efforts to reduce the number of manufacturers of counterfeit clothing. I do not just advocate this because of the Australian Federal Police's jurisdictional limits. I believe it would be more effective to concentrate on the manufacturers. Unlike clothing retailers at the markets whose only expense is a small stallholders fee, manufacturers face start-up costs. These backyard operators usually purchase a four-carousel printer for $1,000. A pizza oven, heater and a gas bottle could come to $3,000 or $4,000, and silk screens cost up to $30 each. For a cost of under $7,000 their returns can be phenomenal. Typical incomes for clothing counterfeiters run from $50,000 to $300,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of one case where it was alleged that an individual had a yearly cash income of $110,000 but a declared income of only $5,000. The collection by the Government of payroll tax, company tax, income tax and sales tax then drops. Employment in the clothing sector has already declined from 98,000 in 1971 to 64,000 in 1991. Many clothing companies can cope with predictable changes such as the removal of quotas and reductions in tariffs, but it is much harder for them to cope with the activities of counterfeiters. The latter problem is within our power as a community to solve if we set our minds to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to get the message through to our judiciary that we will not tolerate the loss of jobs and investment that result from widespread counterfeiting of clothing. A prerequisite is publicity, together with enforcement by the law. Media publicity or other parliamentary awareness of counterfeiting will result in a change in community attitudes. Consumers will be less likely to go to a weekend market believing that they are really buying a Jag or Country Road or Rip Curl garment if they know that the real manufacturer never sells through markets, only through shops and, in very few places, factory outlets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the comments that have been made on this issue by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). In the city of Geelong and in the Geelong region we share the representation of many textile, clothing and footwear firms that are suffering because of the practice of counterfeiting clothing. But I must say to the honourable member for Corangamite that he does stretch his credibility by coming into this place talking about these issues, because the people of Geelong and the Geelong region know full well that in the lead-up to the last federal election the honourable member walked and drove the length and breadth of the Corangamite electorate preaching a very dry economic rationalist line. Of course&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WU5">Mr O'CONNOR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member may interject but the simple reality is that he proposed to those manufacturers, the textile and clothing manufacturers in the Geelong region, that a zero to five per cent tariff was going to be a mechanism that would enhance the interests of this industry and employment in this industry in the region. I welcome his interest in this particular regional industry but I put it to him that, if he had come into this place on this side of the Parliament as a member of a government with a zero tariff policy, then the people who have come to him over the issue of labelling and country of origin counterfeiting would not have been coming to him over that particular issue; they would be coming to me, and to him, fighting for their very survival under a zero to five per cent tariff regime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Corangamite has pursued this dry economic line for many years in this particular region. We had many political battles in the early 1980s and the mid-1980s. He might recall the battle that we had over the Colac pool when the city of Colac sought $100,000 from the Federal Government to construct a community facility. All we wanted from the honourable member for Corangamite was a letter of support. It was not forthcoming but the visionaries in that particular area pressed ahead. We built the facility. It is a good example of public enterprise that has gone well. It is now running at a profit and it is servicing the needs of the Colac community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did hear a rumour the other day that the honourable member for Corangamite was actually trying to claim some credit for that facility. Recently, the honourable member opposed any federal government assistance going to BWK to locate in the region. So I welcome this interest that he is currently showing. I am sure that it is genuine&mdash;I have no doubt of that&mdash;but I think I should point out to the House the honourable member's record in this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to current government programs and I refer to the local government capital works program. There is an interesting program in the honourable member's electorate to build a surf museum that will complement Quicksilver and Rip Curl. I am not sure whether the honourable member supported that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WU5">Mr O'CONNOR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did support that, and that is welcome support for that particular project. I do believe at some stage he did say that it was a pretty short-term employment creation project with no long-term enduring benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the honourable member has come into the House and he knows the respect that I have for him. He has raised an issue that is of concern not only to textiles, clothing and footwear manufactures in Geelong but also to other industries throughout Australia. This counterfeiting problem has its genesis in two particular areas: the counterfeiting of labels and brand names and the counterfeiting of the country of origin labels that are put on products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that counterfeiting is causing extensive damage to the clothing industry's intellectual property. The Geelong region has firms, as the honourable member for Corangamite has indicated, which have significant investment in intellectual property. It is that intellectual property that is being pirated and damaged by the activities that the honourable member for Corangamite has so eloquently put to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Geelong clothing industry, generally, has directed its activities in recent times to capturing niche markets, to producing high quality garments and high value added materials that have a high retail price. In this environment, they are really sitting ducks for the activities of the counterfeiters and the pirates that are attempting to come in on the back of the good name that these products have in the Australian marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The marking for country of origin on imported goods is enforced by the Australian Customs Service. It recently, as the honourable member said, set up a series of task forces in each State to really home in on those who are pirating. It was code named Operation Cipher. While many of the activities uncovered were of a minor nature, the task forces have found that there are significant deceptive practices being instituted by people overseas and these practices are damaging the Australian producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Customs Service has made strong efforts to bring this particular issue to the forefront of importers' minds. There was a story recently on the ABC's program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Investigators</EMPHASIS>, followed by an appearance by the then Minister on the Ray Martin <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Midday Show</EMPHASIS>, which excited a lot of consumer interest. But, whilst the ACS has significantly lifted the level of compliance in the last nine months, especially in the apparels and accessories area, there is still widespread abuse of this particular practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has shown its commitment to correct country of origin labelling of goods with the establishment of two working parties, set up to study the means available to make country of origin labelling more comprehensive, accurate and informative. A draft report on the working parties' deliberations has been prepared. I would like to cite to the House some of the recommendations that came out of that. I commend the Minister for publishing this particular report and I commend it to honourable members and other interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The working group considered basically four options. Option 1 was to maintain the status quo with additional resources for enforcement, that is, that there would be no real changes to the legislative arrangements but the enforcement angle would be stiffened up by the adding of considerable resources. In option 2 the working party canvassed the repeal of all statutory requirements to label with country of origin and to let the existing false misleading provisions under Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation prevail. Option 2 called for a repeal of all statutory requirements to label with country of origin and for the introduction of consumer product information standards under the Trade Practices Act, which defines acceptable descriptors and stipulates the specific classes of goods that must be labelled. Option 4 referred to the repeal of all statutory requirements to label with country of origin and the introduction of a new division into the TPA which defines acceptable descriptors to be used if any claim of country of origin is made voluntary or, when stipulated, requires that the goods must be labelled with country of origin information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I may refer to the clothing industry generally&mdash;and it relates to the firms that are now operating in the Geelong area&mdash;the Australian Government's policy assistance to the industry has been directed to encouraging market rather than production orientated activities. The Government has sought to encourage producers that have close relationships with retailers. It has encouraged the development of branded quality merchandise and it has encouraged those manufacturers that engage in quick response manufacturing techniques. We have those, of course, in the electorates that the honourable member for Corangamite and I represent. The success of the Government's policy lies in the fact that value adding in the clothing industry generally in Australia is about $2.2 billion and I believe that since 1986-87 exports from this particular industry have increased to about $418 million. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in seconding the motion of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). It has particular relevance to my own electorate. It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) attacking the honourable member for Corangamite on the issue of tariffs. I understand that in a previous incarnation the honourable member for Corio worked for then Senator Button in his role as Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and, as we know, Senator Button reduced tariffs and removed quotas at a greater rate than any other politician in Australia, with the possible exception of Gough Whitlam. So I am going to report the honourable member for Corio to his former master and make sure that he is rapped across the knuckles for his untoward remarks in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point in relation to his remarks, many of which were devoted to imports and the labelling of imports, is a problem we have at the moment that was raised by my honourable friend and is one that is very domestic. These are things that are being made here, labelled here and counterfeited here that are ruining local businesses. So it is the local thing that we are really raising in this debate and, whilst we are very pleased that all these other things are going on, as mentioned by the honourable member for Corio, I want to concentrate on the particular concerns of local manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can illustrate this best, I think, by quoting directly from a letter from one of my constituents, Mr Terry Fitzgerald of Hot Buttered Pty Ltd. I will read the letter because it illustrates the problem in a very direct way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, the northern beaches&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is in Sydney&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are the home of Australia's surfing industry. The area has produced more World Champions, leading surf board designers and manufacturers, magazines and films/video than another 20 km of coastline in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>That has been challenged by the honourable member for Corio, and I also notice that the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) is likely to challenge it, but we are very proud of our industry in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The area is the home to not only my company since 1971,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is Mr Fitzgerald's company&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but also, Peak Wetsuits of Newport, O'Neill Wetsuits at Warriewood, Insight Surfboards, Energy Surfboards and at least twenty surf retailers. Offices are maintained on the Peninsula by Victorian companies Rip Curl Wetsuits and Quiksilver Garments and Wetsuits, as well as Queensland's Billabong.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Various Agents represent companies such as Mambo, Oakley, Reef of Brazil, Freestyle, and a plethora of other surfing labels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point is, your electorate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, mine&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is essentially the hub of Australia's surfing industry with its subsequent effects on surfing's multi-million dollar export. My company alone exports to eleven countries. . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gist of the problem is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Surf Industry labels are being blatantly ripped-off on a continuing basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.My label has been found in a number of markets including Parklea, Menangle, Cowes, Geelong, and Tamworth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.This unauthorised use has multiple effects on our label:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*Retailers cutting back because of t-shirts being sold at three for $10.00 at markets, as against our retail of $35.00 for instance.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*Cheap Chinese t-shirts with bad printing reflect on our brand and quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Over last summer, I had a private investigator continually policing markets and serving `Cease and Desist' letters at great expense. Needless to say, some results were obtained, but, effectively illegal stock just moved sideways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.All major players in the industry spent tens of thousands of dollars on what is a rapidly growing anti-counterfeiting industry combating the counterfeiting industry. And with little or no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.I know of only <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">one</EMPHASIS> prosecution taking place against illegal TM usage. By Victorian Police at Collingwood.&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>although, I understand, there have been some more&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So where do we go from here to protect our domestic marketplaces?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How do we convince the Federal Police to act under the Trade Marks Act and take advantage of stiffer penalties to be imposed?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can we get some action against this blatant abuse of labels that have been built over decades, and represent Australia and your electorate in virtually every major export market in the world?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Fitzgerald goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Carlton, you cannot believe how frustrating it is to write cheques for private&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>detectives&mdash;actually, he says `private dicks', but I thought that would be unparliamentary!&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to try and stem abuse of hard earned product integrity. Particularly when there seems to be very little interest whatsoever in pursuing the counterfeiters by the authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now I am pleased to hear that the Federal Police are stepping up its campaign here, assisted by the State Police, and I am very happy indeed to support this being raised in the Parliament by my colleague.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I applaud the motion put before this House by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) and endorse the comments that have been made, particularly by my colleague the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). The issue obviously relates to the domestic scene, as the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) has just indicated, but it is also of course not only an international problem, but an international problem with respect to counterfeiting across a whole range of industries, and we are going to hear a lot more about this issue in this place in the foreseeable future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an issue that relates to both country of origin labelling and brand labelling. What I would like to do, as the basis for supporting this motion, is to refer briefly to the more general picture in the clothing industry. I believe that it is important that we in this place should be supporting our domestic clothing industry. There is a view in many areas in this country, particularly in high places in the bureaucracy, that this country has a very limited future with the manufacture of clothing, but it is certainly not a view that I endorse. It is important that we make every effort, particularly in legitimate areas such as protecting local manufacturers from aspects like counterfeiting, to ensure that our manufacturers are able to compete genuinely in an environment which assists them to both sell and market their products here and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a very substantial presence of the clothing manufacturing industry in my electorate, in areas such as Brunswick, Richmond and Collingwood. It is true that there are aspects of this industry that do essentially produce relatively cheap and relatively poor quality products. That has certainly been the predominant image that the Australian clothing manufacturing industry has laboured under for some time. In reality, it is a misconceived image and, certainly, considerable change has been occurring in the industry in recent years. There are areas where there are very poor working conditions for workers, antiquated technology and inward-looking attitudes on the part of management but, in my view, the proportion of the industry where these characteristics can be said to be the case is decreasing fairly rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are clothing manufacturers in my electorate who accept that the tariff wall and the structures that have been in place for some time in this country to protect the industry do need to be wound back. Their view essentially is that the pace of change is the key issue, not so much whether the change is necessary. I have spoken to these people and they accept the need for the reduction in tariffs and the inevitability of that occurring. Their major objection, which I sympathise with, is that the speed at which change is occurring is placing them and their ability to innovate and employ new staff under too much pressure too quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is new technology investment occurring; there is an upskilling in staff occurring in many areas. We should be ensuring that this type of change can occur productively in the manufacturing sector while we are gradually&mdash;and I emphasise the word `gradually'&mdash;winding back the tariff protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key problem that we face, particularly in my electorate&mdash;and one that will increasingly occupy the attention of the Government&mdash;is that we now have a middle-aged work force very heavily dominated by migrant women, who have been losing jobs in this sector and related sectors and for whom the opportunities for re-employment elsewhere are extremely limited. We will need a great deal of collective will, and a willingness to think laterally and to intervene in the marketplace, in order to be able to provide future employment opportunities for these people. A very substantial number of them have been assisted by the Government through labour market programs and the like, but equally there are many who have slipped through the net and who have not taken up the opportunities offered under some of the very innovative labour market programs of the Government. Equally, there are others who have been in a position where they have been unable to avail themselves of these opportunities. If society is saying to people, `Sorry, you have to lose your job because of restructuring in order to benefit our society at large', then it is society's responsibility to ensure that those people do not suffer unduly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the motion as a very worthwhile effort to ensure that the local clothing industry is assisted in one of a variety of ways that this House and this Government need to undertake in order to protect the existing industry from underhand, illicit activities that can undermine its genuine efforts for innovation and change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me much pleasure to speak in support of the very worthwhile motion of my colleague and friend the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), whose interest in whether a swimming pool should be built in the Corio area was mainly based on whether the community had enough knowledge of what the cost would be and the outcomes. His homework there probably helped the project to get off the ground and be more viable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My interest in this area was heightened somewhat by a visit I made to Asia some years ago when I proudly purchased a Sheaffer pen. I thought that I had got a real bargain, but I found that it melted in the hot sun about a day later. I was very angry about that, so I sympathise with the manufacturers and people of skill and talent when they actually see their ideas being stolen. We have many of them in Australia and we should be encouraging them as much as we can, particularly in the value added industry area. What this motion deals with is the burgeoning industry of stealing the intellectual knowledge of Australian manufacturers and innovators who are prepared to work hard and to risk their capital to develop ideas and products so that we can create permanent jobs for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an increasing tendency in Australia for people to go to markets. They are good fun; I go to them in my electorate in Wangaratta, Wodonga and Mount Beauty, and sometimes I go to the famous Melbourne markets and the Essendon market&mdash;I enjoy them and so does my family. But the consumers going to markets in increasing numbers&mdash;hundreds of thousands every year&mdash;are being duped, not by all stall operators but by many of them, because the products being sold are blatantly being marketed as belonging to particular brands when in fact they are fakes. I guess the Australian culture tends to let things drift on, so that if nothing more stringent is done about this we will find a breaking down of standards. It will be seen to be okay that these markets allow this sort of thing to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As well as helping the Australian Federal Police in its difficult job of enforcing the trademark laws, I believe we should be developing and concentrating on the education area. We should also seek, in consultation with local government and with the people who manage the markets, some self-discipline and some peer review amongst stallholders. That would complement the existing trade laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, I would like the operators of markets, who are the people who allocate space to the stallholders, to be involved in discussions and dialogue with honourable members such as the honourable member for Corangamite, who has taken the initiative to draw our attention to this issue, to see whether they would be willing to introduce guidelines into the markets; that is, whether they would not allocate space for people to operate from the markets unless there were some guidelines and some discipline in relation to how the goods were displayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There ought to be truth of origin. Before the law on country of origin is brought in and improved, as undoubtedly it will be, there ought to be a simple statement from the operator to the stallholder. The operators should be able to say that if the stallholders are going to put clothing on display, they are required to put a board up that says that they are satisfied, as much as possible, that the products they are offering were in fact manufactured in such and such a country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing wrong with asking people to do that. We should involve them in that way. We should tell them that what they are doing is helping us build a nation in which commercial investment, skills and talent are being fostered and encouraged for everybody's benefit. We should say that we can tackle the problems much better as a team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would go one step further and ask the operators of the markets not to allow people to set up their wares and operate in the community markets unless they have made reasonable inquiries from the stallholders about the truth of the labels that are on the particular products they are marketing. If we added that sort of dimension to the debate, as well as the dimension of enforcing the law and the penalties, we might start to make a lot more progress than we have. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) for raising this very important issue in the House today. I think all honourable members would agree with the sentiments that he has put forward because, if nothing else, we are all Australians who have the interests of the Australian community and economy at heart, no matter how we choose to demonstrate it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is very clear to anyone who goes shopping or who talks to people in the community is that Australians want to buy Australian goods. They are quite prepared to put a price premium on that. In some areas of merchandising it is estimated that a price premium of between 10 and 15 per cent is acceptable to Australian consumers if they know that what they are buying is Australian. Australian's recognise the obvious benefit of that. They want to help their fellow workers to keep their jobs. They want to increase our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That implies a degree of responsibility in many people. Certainly, the Government has a responsibility to provide a legislative regime that will ensure that people are getting good, clear and accurate information.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, I have wanted to make this speech for six years. When I first entered the Parliament I was on the Parliamentary AIDS Liaison Committee. One of the first things I asked about was the threat of HIV to Aboriginal populations. I was told that plenty was being done, and that we had to be sensitive about it because, if we were not, it would give people an opportunity to reinforce existing prejudices. I accepted that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I became shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs in 1990, I raised the same issues privately. I was told the issue was being adequately addressed. In three years as shadow Minister and spending a lot of that time travelling around Australia visiting Aboriginal communities and on one occasion actually working as a doctor in one of those communities, I have got to say that this issue is not being addressed; and it is a culpable negligence for which this country may pay for many generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the First World, the HIV epidemic has been predominantly confined to the homosexual and IV-drug using communities. The expected third wave under the heterosexual community has happened at a much slower rate than was then predicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the case in Third World countries. In eastern Africa, HIV has been a heterosexual epidemic from the very beginning. There is no evidence that it has ever been associated with homosexual or IV-drug using communities. Similarly in the Second World, such as South-East Asia, the explosion in HIV exposure is occurring through heterosexual contact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most recent data out of Zimbabwe suggests that the virus is so widespread in some parts of that country that 42 per cent of young women presenting for their first medical visit during pregnancy screen positive to the HIV virus. Well over half of these will be dead within ten years. Of these, well over half will die of AIDS or AIDS related illnesses, the majority within five years. Thirty per cent of the infants will be born with HIV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is virtually no person working in the field in Australia who denies the possibility that, once the HIV virus becomes established in the Aboriginal population, its pattern will be that of the Third World rather than that of the First World. Of all the risk factors existing to have caused the epidemic in Africa, the same risk factors exist in Australia's Aboriginal population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">HIV has the potential to cause a holocaust in Aboriginal society. The late Fred Hollows estimated that we face the prospect of having 40,000 Aborigines die of AIDS in the next decade. To put this in context, this is 50 per cent greater than the number of Australians killed in World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no hard evidence that HIV has extensively entered the Aboriginal community so far. The Northern Territory appears virtually free, the only cluster of cases existing in Queensland around Palm Island and Townsville. The late entry of HIV into Aboriginal society is not easily explained, but the following seems a reasonable hypothesis: contact between Aboriginal and European society is mainly heterosexual. While homosexual activity is well documented in traditional society, there seems to be little traffic between big cities and remote communities. There has not been a heterosexual HIV epidemic in Australia to date. And the majority of drug use in Aboriginal communities is alcohol; needle use is rare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that, once HIV enters Aboriginal communities, it will spread quickly and extensively. The epidemic will follow the African model, which expects predominantly heterosexual transmission with high rates of transmission between mother and child. The effects upon the Aboriginal community are frightening to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this will predominantly affect traditional society, the epidemic has the possibility of wiping out a good part of traditional Australia. This could be the event that results in the death of Aboriginal culture as we know it today. There will be a very substantial orphan population, as the highest death rate will be expected in people between 20 and 40 years of age. It can be expected to lead to a reduction in population in parts of remote Australia and a likely further breakdown of what society is left in those places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Efforts to prevent this epidemic have been largely unsuccessful in Africa and South-East Asia. However, if any country in the world should be able to successfully prevent HIV transmission, it should be Australia. We have a highly educated medical and paramedical work force, a well developed health system and a great deal of expertise in the area. We only have one chance to control the HIV epidemic in Aboriginal Australia and that is before the disease has entered the community. Given the horrendous costs of treating people with AIDS, any prevention is likely to be cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to address some specific difficulties with a comprehensive national HIV program. There is a lack of data about the prevalence and distribution of sexually transmitted diseases in the Aboriginal population and there is a very large reservoir of untreated sexually transmitted disease in Aboriginal communities, which leads to a very high re-infection rate. These figures are kept secret but in some urban communities in Australia we have rates of sexually transmitted diseases higher than in the slums of Atlanta or New York. The resurgence in ceremonies associated with men's business across the whole of central and northern Australia has real risks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a management level, there is simply no group in Australia looking strategically at this issue. There is no security of funding arrangements. These tend to be for one year at a time and there are numerous examples of a good strategy starting up, having been negotiated and agreed upon, but there being no funding to carry it through. The extreme secrecy of men's ceremonies makes it a very hard area in which to undertake adequate education. The present system of AIDS funding through NACAIDS has served Aboriginal people particularly poorly. There is no coordinated approach, funding is not secure and generally is of 12 months duration. Aboriginal people believe they have been largely forgotten by existing funding sources, even though on a relative risk basis the greatest current risk is unquestionably in the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a clinical level, the following problems exist. There is still considerable uncertainty as to the most efficacious of different treatment regimes, and research is clearly needed in areas specific to Australia. In some parts of Australia over 10 per cent of the population carry dono virus. We do not know how best to treat that and the answer is not going to be found overseas; it is going to be found in research here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are some positive aspects. We are not starting from scratch and a significant body of opinion amongst Aboriginal medical services and in Aboriginal society generally recognises that the problem is growing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To have a nationally coordinated approach I believe there are 10 things that could be done much better than are being done now. For a start, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, need an independent advisory committee. Given the abysmal role of the department in this, the committee has to report directly to the Minister and not through the department. There is enormous scope to have additional trainees working as Aboriginal health workers and to run additional seminars for people from communities. There is still in communities a lack of AIDS and STD videos in Aboriginal languages; clinical services in parts of Australia are exceedingly poor; there is no stand alone walk-in STD clinic in the whole of the Northern Territory and upgrading of local facilities needs to occur. We need to have clinical STD research; we need to have a screening program&mdash;a voluntary program&mdash;with a pilot program first to work out the most efficient method to get it going and then a main program that works very hard. There needs to be a men's program. It is easy to do and it would not take a long time. We need a significant increase in the number of Aboriginal HIV workers. In the end, a program like this over five years needs to be reviewed to see whether we are making any difference. It is easy to do: we have got markers and we have got very objective ways to work out whether we are making a difference or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A program like this cannot simply be given over to ATSIC, to the Department of Health, to the Aboriginal health services or to State or Territory governments&mdash;it has got to be given to everyone collectively. Health is a very political issue in Aboriginal society, and this should not be an issue of politics between Aboriginal controlled organisations and State and Territory organisations; it should be the issue that has these organisations starting to work together. My criticisms today are not particularly a failure of NACAIDS, of AMCA, of the Federal Government or State or Territory governments&mdash;it is a failure of everybody. It is a failure of leadership because this country has seen no leadership on this issue at all. As I said at the beginning, I have waited six years to make this speech and I do it very seriously. Had I been the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs after the last election, I would be seeking to implement this program now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make this speech and put it on the public record because I have got a horrible feeling that in 100 years time my descendants will look back at me and say, `You were in a position to do something and you did not. Why not?'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recently had occasion to view on the ABC, under the program title <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">True Stories</EMPHASIS>, a documentary entitled `Admission Impossible'. As an ardent supporter of the ABC and one who applauds its important role in our society, I find it a matter of deep concern when the ABC puts to air a documentary that consists of old Cinesound news clips which&mdash;like most of the news films made at that time&mdash;when dealing with Aboriginal or immigration issues, were heavily laden with racially stereotyped comments and presentation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with Australia's postwar immigration program, this ABC program chose to give a selective and misleading version of our immigration history and the role of the Hon. Arthur Calwell, who is acknowledged as the founder of Australia's immigration program. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">True Stories</EMPHASIS> program would have led any uninformed citizen to conclude that Arthur Calwell, as a forthright supporter of the White Australia Policy, allowed that policy to dictate all aspects of immigration policy. It repeated as evidence the standard `Two Wongs don't make a White' allegation. It suggested that an extension of this led to a clearly anti-Semitic aspect of the program that improperly discriminated against Jewish immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The White Australia Policy was the plank of all major political parties in the 1950s. The change that has taken place in all political parties was a generational change that commenced in the late 1950s and continued through the 1960s. As a policy, it was based on a community of fear of cheap Asian labour, upon our geographic isolation and upon our Anglo-Celtic origins. It is a gross distortion of our history to suggest, as was implied in this television program, that adherence to the concept of white Australia by our political leaders&mdash;and, I might add, by all political parties&mdash;in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s was the product of individual racist attitudes on the part of those leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arthur Calwell, like other leaders of that period, was a supporter of the White Australia Policy, but he was not a racist. On the question of Jewish immigration, Calwell allowed the Jewish community to process applications to expedite immigration of survivors of the Holocaust and the camps of Europe when they were excluded from immigrating to Britain and the United States. When they had nowhere else in the world to go, Calwell allowed them to come here. The community also arranged for Jewish immigration from Shanghai, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Javanese Prince</EMPHASIS> arrived on 31 March 1946. From November 1945 to November 1946, landing permits were issued to 7,829 Jews out of 14,545 applicants and, from 1945 to December 1949, 21,584 permits were issued to the Jewish community out of a total of 71,679 applicants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Calwell was the subject of ostracism and anti-Semitic cartoons because of these decisions. As was pointed out recently by the distinguished historian, Professor Bill Rubenstein, author of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jews in Australia</EMPHASIS>, the `Are you Jewish?' clause, which featured heavily in this film, was the policy used to identify Jews and speed up their arrival. It was not used to discriminate against them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The affection with which Arthur Calwell is still regarded by survivors of the Holocaust in my electorate is testimony enough. I certainly support Professor Rubenstein's view that that segment of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">True Stories</EMPHASIS> program dealing with Jewish immigration to Australia is nonsense from start to finish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `Two Wongs don't make a White' statement has been not only widely and grievously used in this program but almost continuously used in textbooks to suggest racist attitudes on the part of Arthur Calwell. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 2 December 1947 indicates that a question was asked concerning deportation generally and, in particular, deportation of a Chinaman who had been in the country for many years. That gentleman's name was Wong. It is clear that the department had issued an order for deportation on the wrong person. Calwell was explaining this. During his reply he was subjected to persistent interjections by the honourable member for Balaclava, who was then a Mr White. In concluding his remarks, Mr Calwell said, and I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many Wongs in the Chinese community, but I have to say&mdash;and I am sure that the honourable member for Balaclava will not mind me doing so&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he was responding to the kind of interjection that we are pretty familiar with in this House&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that `two Wongs do not make a White'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was a specific reference at that time to the then honourable member for Balaclava, Mr White. What then occurred was that the newspapers in Australia which were strongly anti-Calwell, excluded the capital `W'. That statement then became `two Wongs do not make a white' a continual repetition which made it a segment of both the attitude of Arthur Calwell and a gross assertion purporting to be the base for our immigration policy. I am pleased to have had this opportunity to correct that piece of Australian history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change in the capital `W' made by the newspapers, changed that statement from a specific response to an interjection and converted it into a statement relevant to the formulation of immigration policy. As his daughter, Mary Elizabeth Calwell, who is equally outraged by this program, has correctly pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My father changed the Immigration category of the `Middle East' from Asia to Europe, tried to relieve restrictions on the Chinese community in 1947 and encouraged people to keep their heritage. He was an Australian, proud of his Irish, American and Welsh ancestry who spoke Gaelic and some Mandarin. He said that `politics is the art of the possible' and it is sad that the reviewer apparently accepted an appalling misrepresentation of the person who ensured the future of Judaism and Jewry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>I was a pallbearer at Arthur Calwell's funeral and I watched as the heart of Melbourne stopped to pay tribute to this great Australian. It was also interesting to note that the nature of politics was such that the then former Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, who was at that time quite ill and who could not physically present himself in the church, sat outside in his car during the ceremony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who talk about this man Calwell as a racist, it is interesting to note that as a tribute, not merely to their local member but to a distinguished Minister of immigration, the Chinese community which is centred in Melbourne in the heart of Little Bourke Street,  closed  their  shops  and their restaurants. That was a tribute of enormous proportions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I am bound to conclude that with a little more research on the part of the producers of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Admission Impossible</EMPHASIS> and, perhaps, with a little more regard by those who were responsible in the ABC for getting this program to air, the community would have been informed of the origins of our immigration policy and the vision of Arthur Calwell, rather than a scissors and paste exercise in the presentation of a film which, one can only conclude, sought to justify the conclusions and inaccurate perceptions of its producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a letter from a distinguished and very senior immigration official, who was responsible for the administration of policy. His letter, which he also sent to the ABC, is in strong support of the role and vision of Arthur Calwell and condemnatory of this program. I seek leave to table a letter from Mr H. J.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, I want to draw to the attention of the Parliament the very serious nature of the agricultural downturn that is facing farmers in this nation. This downturn, I believe, is very much more serious than the cyclical downturns we have seen in the past and it has national implications. It is not only a very serious economic and social problem; it is also a very serious problem for the environment. I would suggest that the response of the Government to date can only be described as pathetic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993-94 the net value of farm production is forecast to be $2.1 billion. This is about half what it was in the late 1980s. I am talking about the average for the 1980s, not just one year. But the situation is very much more serious than just the economic one. It has a much wider effect where it is devastating the families of many individuals. It is devastating farms and it is devastating local communities. The tragedy is that so much of the wider community is largely unaware of just how serious it is and, in particular, what the effect of the lack of investment that has come about through this economic downturn is having right throughout country Australia. It seems that the whole productive base of primary industry, which has been the backbone of this nation for the last 150 years or more, is being eroded and eroded quite rapidly at a time when, frankly, I think this nation needs more than ever before to have a strong, vibrant and healthy, agricultural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the Government's priorities. For example, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) made a lot of noise with his recent announcement concerning the rural adjustment scheme involving somewhat less than $50 million. Putting that in perspective, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) is authorising for his new gazebo, Gareth's gazebo, the new building for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, an amount at least four times that figure. Given past records of government spending, one would suspect that that might even get higher. I think that indicates the priorities that the Government has&mdash;and I would suggest very wrong priorities&mdash;when it comes to dealing with what is a very serious problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things to remember about our farming community is just how much it has increased its productivity. While commodity prices have steadily declined since the 1960s, farmers are becoming more productive and yields are up by about 40 per cent since 1970. In fact, since 1970 the agricultural sector has increased productivity at literally double the rate of other economic sectors. Yet in the last two decades, with an annual productivity growth averaging 2.2 per cent, we still are seeing a decline in agriculture. Total rural debt, for example, has blown out from $10.6 billion in 1987 to $15.6 billion last year and no doubt that figure will be exceeded this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average woolgrower lost almost $40,000 last year and a loss of $34,000 is expected this year. Given the $34,000 that the Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics is forecasting for next year, that is a loss of over $100,000. That person and his or her family have to live as well as try to run a business, and the impact of that loss is very severe. A three-year loss for a broad acre farmer&mdash;that is one who is involved in cropping as well&mdash;is expected to be just under $50,000. Again, a very serious problem is emerging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the problems go further than that. Because of the lack of investment we are seeing problems in three areas. We are seeing a decline in the productive assets, we are seeing a decline in the level of services to the rural community, and we are increasingly seeing a lack of resources available to tackle some of the environmental problems that are degrading many of our farmlands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very long-term problem and one the Government has not tried to address to date. To start with the Government has not recognised the growing lack of competitiveness of Australian farmers partly imposed by the tax regime that currently is there. The Government's own figures confirm that Australian farmers are three to five per cent worse off against our trading partners due to the taxes on inputs into production. We have to recognise that people in the country are also disadvantaged by the fuel taxes that impact very much more on people living in rural areas than they do on people living in the city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question about how we are to continue to match the world's best practice has to be addressed in the light of the lack of investment in new plant and equipment. There was a farm facts assets survey done in 1991 and it found that only eight per cent of the farming equipment was less than five years old and that there was a tendency for machinery age to be related to the declining yield of crops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one goes to other farming areas, one will find that woolsheds, for example, have an average age of 45 years&mdash;and there are many innovations in woolsheds that ought to be adopted and obviously have not been. Sheep yards have an average age of 27 years and cattle yards an average age of 21 years, and all those studied in this survey were in less than fair condition. The number of farm machinery dealers is also indicative of what is happening: 2,400 in 1986; 950 in 1991&mdash;less than half&mdash;with a further fall of 300 expected in the current year. In other words, the number of farm machinery dealers in the last seven years has dropped to one quarter: a staggering statistic! Think of what that is doing, by way of not only its direct impact on farming but also, through that, its impact on local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to look at the effect on the environment. There is no doubt that farmers have been at the forefront in trying to turn around land degradation. In fact, they really are the only people who can do it. Of course, it all costs money. If they are losing money&mdash;for example, a woolgrower may lose $100,000 over three years&mdash;how on earth are they going to be able to afford to do what they know in their own hearts is right? How can they do that if they cannot spare the money just to live, let alone get on with doing some of those other things?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the effect of this decline on the rural communities, we see a decline in the number of people living there and a decline in the infrastructure in the rural towns, with people moving to the cities. Of course there are many assets that are underutilised, at the same time as increasing pressures are occurring on some of the big cities. If one looks at a simple thing like the family home on a farm these days, in many cases those homes are deteriorating and would be considerably inferior to the sort of home that people would expect to live in in one of the major cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of capital investment goes on. This is seen not just in tractors and so on, but also in the fact that farmers cannot afford to employ enough people to keep their farms up to a reasonable standard. In the same survey, 64 per cent of the farmers said they needed more labour, but only five per cent said they could afford it. When we look at the effects of some of the other Government policies on people trying to survive on the land, we find that it all militates against them. Look at the assets test that is applied to Austudy. Sure, farmers may have a nominal value in their farm but, if they have no income, I think that really is an unjust way of assessing eligibility for Austudy. This is reflected very strongly in the number of farming children who go on to tertiary education. If we look at some of the studies that have been done in Victoria, we find that the numbers are about half those of their city counterparts&mdash;a very frightening statistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would suggest that this is a very serious problem, not just for country Australia but for the whole nation. All Australians should be concerned about this long-term decline in our rural sector. It may be largely invisible to many, nonetheless it is very real, very serious, and I believe it should be addressed as a national priority not just for country people but for the whole nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance relates to a matter that was probably discussed earlier today&mdash;country of origin labelling and products sold in Australia. It arises out of an example of misleading labelling brought to my attention by a constituent in my electorate of Oxley. Like most Australians, this constituent likes whenever possible to purchase products which are actually produced in Australia. Most Australians recognise the need to buy Australian in order to help reduce our balance of payments deficit and to reduce our dependency on imports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that all honourable members welcome moves by the Government over recent years to encourage consumers to buy Australian, and it is certainly something that I very strongly welcome. One example of successful Government action in this area has been the buy your kids a job program which the Government has run in conjunction with the Advance Australia Foundation. The Government has also given the foundation financial assistance for its Australian Made campaign. In this financial year, over $4 million has been allocated to help the Australian Made campaign promotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If all Australians made the decision to buy Australian made products wherever feasible and stopped buying foreign made substitutes, it would be a huge boost to Australia's economic development. If we as consumers are to buy Australian made, it should be easy to judge from a product's packaging whether a product is or is not Australian made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, because of the misleading labelling which appears on some products, the task of buying Australian made is not always as easy as it should be. Take the example of the product brought to my attention by one of my constituents, the Sheen video cassette. I have actually got one here with me. I cannot do much with it in terms of incorporating it but I will just explain what it says on the packaging. On the front of the packaging for the video cassette, in large bold printing, it has the words, `The All Australian Video Group', right across the front of it. In the bottom right-hand corner it has the words `Australian Guarantee' and that is surrounded by two boomerangs. One would assume that is an Australian made product with all the identification on the front of it. Any consumer who looked only at the front of this packaging would assume that this product was made in Australia by an Australian owned company, as the packaging uses the words `all Australian' and uses the boomerang, which is well known and easily identified as a symbol of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when we look carefully at the back of the box we will soon discover that this is not the case. Actually, on the back of this product, it actually has `Made in Korea' in one corner of it. Then, when we go a little bit further, we also discover that, rather than being manufactured by an `All Australian Video Group', the product is manufactured under licence for Victor Company of Japan. So we have all the other things on the front of it which indicate that it is clearly an Australian product but when we look at the back it is made in Korea, manufactured under licence for the Victor company of Japan. It is clearly misleading advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst manufacturers of this product abide by the letter of the law by having the words `Made in Korea' on the packaging, they are clearly attempting to mislead consumers by implying on the front of the box that the package is manufactured in Australia by an Australian owned company. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8J4">Mr LES SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly is outrageous, and it has to be stopped. Clearly action has to be taken to stop companies misleading consumers about the country of origin of a product by the manner in which this product has been labelled. The Government has recently begun the process of developing a strategy for more accurate country of origin labelling, and the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) has been working particularly hard in this area. I congratulate her on those efforts. Last October the Government established a working party consisting of a range of representatives from various government departments and agencies to draw up options for country of origin labelling schemes. The report of the working group was released early this week by the Minister for Consumer Affairs. The working group found that the various pieces of legislation currently in force at a federal and State level in relation to country of origin labelling were potentially contradictory, and that many suppliers are not able to work out what is required of them when it comes to labelling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This confusion amongst suppliers then leads to confusion amongst consumers, who cannot determine which country products are actually made in. It is instructive to read the list of descriptions currently in use on packaging in Australia to understand how consumers could easily become confused. The list of descriptors includes&mdash;there is quite a range of them&mdash;made in Australia; Australian made; manufactured in Australia; product of Australia; produce of Australia; produced in Australia; processed in Australia; packaged in Australia; assembled in Australia; servicing Australia; and Australian made from local and imported ingredients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder, with such a diverse number of ways of describing a product, that consumers can easily become confused as to what is Australian made and what is not. The working group's report goes on to outline a proposal for country of origin labelling. This proposal involves amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 to include the descriptors to be used when describing a product and the tests that are to be applied when determining which of the descriptors is to be used for the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the new scheme, any supplier that made a claim about a product's country of origin would have to use the descriptor specified by the new section of the Trade Practices Act. The new scheme will also go some way to addressing the problem that occurs when a product assembled in Australia has foreign made components, another important area. `Made in Australia' would only be able to be used when more than 85 per cent of the cost of producing the product was incurred in Australia. When less than 85 per cent of the input into the production process are Australian, the `Made in Australia' tag could not be used without qualification. Such products would have a qualified statement such as `Made in Australia from Australian and imported components'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee put forward two options for the words that could be used to symbolise that a product was made in Australia. Under option one, suppliers would be restricted to using either `Made in Australia', `Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia'. In the second option terms such as `Produced in Australia' or `Australian Made' could also be used. Also, under option two, the label for a foreign made product would simply state that it was made in wherever was the country of origin. If a manufacturer wished to add additional words such as `Designed in Australia', this could only be done after first stating the product's country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the working groups on country of origin labelling of consumer products is a useful starting point for reform in this area. Clearly, action needs to be taken to ensure that Australians are able to exercise their rights as consumers to purchase Australian made products wherever possible. Only when there is an accurate labelling of a product's country of origin will consumers have the information they need to purchase more Australian goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the moves by the Government to tighten up labelling requirements are a step in the right direction, clearly more needs to be done to prevent false and misleading labelling on products such as the one I have highlighted here this afternoon. The Sheen video cassette would still comply with the letter of the law under the proposed country of origin labelling scheme. Not only should products have their correct country of origin on their packaging, manufacturers such as the Victor company of Japan should not be able to get away with claiming that they are an `All Australian Company', or be able to use well-known Australian symbols such as the boomerang on their products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I welcome the Government's initiatives in the area of country of origin labelling, the measures need to go an extra step to prevent deceptions of the type perpetrated by the manufacturers of the Sheen video cassette. When it comes to purchasing Australian made products, I believe it is one of the most important things that we can look at to actually give jobs to our kids. Given the level of unemployment that we have today, Australian consumers have to become more and more conscious of the need to inspect items and find out if they are Australian goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support very strongly the view that in some stores it would be a good idea to have areas designed specifically for Australian made products and to have foreign made products in other areas. In that way people could go to where they want to go and forget about the foreign goods altogether. It would probably be a better move than labelling and we will see just how many people go to the section in the store that has the foreign made goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a matter that we, as members of Parliament, really need to take a bipartisan approach to and encourage our constituents right throughout our electorates to buy Australian goods wherever possible and be more critical of those products. Sometimes it is not such a bad idea to pay a little bit more for an Australian made product because it may be that it is your son or daughter who is given a job as a result. It is only through developing Australian industries and by purchasing our own locally made products that we can effectively help those people who are unemployed and help develop our industries in Australia, particularly in our manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the House today to this particular product which was drawn to my attention by one of my constituents&mdash;a good friend of mine&mdash;and I think it is important to highlight to the Parliament the problems that consumers face when they wish to buy products. </PARA>

Out of such a debate I believe we will forge a new consciousness of the remarkable democracy which has evolved here&mdash;one of the great democracies of the world&mdash;and its capacity to respond to the challenges we face in a world of accelerating change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will not become more independent either in spirit or in its relations with other nations if we are incapable of acknowledging the uniqueness of our own national experience and the strengths of our institutions. No established nation has advanced its position in the world by apologising for its past or by dismantling what is unique in its institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental weakness of the case of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for a republic is that it is based on an attack on Australia and its past. He seeks to promote his republic by a divisive weakening of our sense of ourselves. The Prime Minister's republic is not the culmination of a history in which we can take pride. It is to be the symbolic slamming of the door on a past which the Prime Minister despises, and the establishment of Australia as an Asian nation which has turned its back on its European heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's republicanism has dark roots in his obsessive hatred of the British origins of Australia's political institutions, law and language. His desire is to expunge every reminder of them, by tearing the Union Jack out of the flag, by writing them out of the constitution and, wherever possible, by rewriting our history. It is also part of his broader agenda to dismantle the checks on his own power which the conventions of our present constitution impose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making his case, he has not hesitated to falsify our history. He has claimed that Australian military forces in the past did not fight under the Australian flag. That is untrue. Australia's soldiers were inspired and uplifted by the flag. This is made clear in Sir John Monash's account of that triumphal and historic moment, when the Australians turned the tide against Germany on 8 August 1918. That day was regarded by the Germans themselves as the turning point of the war, when the Australians and Canadians broke through the German lines. At 1.15 p.m., General Monash recorded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian flag hoisted over Harbonnieres at midday today. Should be glad if Chief would cable this to our Governor-General on behalf of Australian corps.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's identity has been enriched and broadened by the growing number of people who have come from other European countries, as it has by the growing acknowledgment of the importance of the heritage of the Aboriginal people. These, too, are important elements in our identity. But a national leader who seeks to create the future by denying, attacking and distorting, and who is embarrassed by the central contribution of Britain to our institutions, our law, our language and our national identity, is offering an impoverished and inadequate foundation for our future. It is a foundation based on a deep misunderstanding of what Australia has been and is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we owe the strength and stability of our democracy to any source, it is to Britain&mdash;the world's most successful proponent of constitutional government. Even apparently minor conventions, such as the presentation of the Governor-General's address in the upper house, remind us of past victories of Parliament over the executive but which the Prime Minister, in his grab for power, is all too ready and keen to expunge. It is not forelock tugging to acknowledge this; it is honesty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the ugly features of the current debate, indeed, is the promotion of an intolerant and narrow view of what it is to be an Australian, which rests on a denial and distortion of our history, and which demands the rejection and disavowal of long established institutions and traditions combined with the astonishing assertion that, although they have been around for a very long time, they are not really Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most extreme version of this that I have seen is contained within a report on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ethnic composition of the Australian Defence Force</EMPHASIS> by four academics from the Australian Defence Force Academy and the Australian National University. Chapter 10 of this report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Images of the Australian Defence Force</EMPHASIS>, argues that the Defence Force should abandon ceremonies, symbols and celebrations which are clearly British in origin in favour of ceremonies, symbols and celebrations which are, in its words, `truly Australian'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always reasonable to suggest that institutions adjust to change, but this report has features which are deeply disturbing. It does not simply suggest revision of, or additions to, the traditions and practices of the defence forces. It effectively recommends wholesale abandonment of features of the defence forces which have obvious British origins. In doing so, the report adopts a highly restrictive interpretation of Australia's multicultural society. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scottish regalia denies the Australianness of the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA>The millions of Australians of Scottish origin would deeply resent the claim that they are un-Australian. A genuine and broad concept of multiculturalism should not be so hesitant to acknowledge the contribution of the ethnic groups from Britain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the report is underpinned by an untenable concept of Australian identity and a fictitious view of Australian history. What it calls `truly Australian' is, in reality, what is narrowly Australian. While on the one hand supporting the notion of Australia as a multicultural society, it is reluctant to acknowledge as `truly Australian' anything which has its origins elsewhere in the world, particularly if elsewhere is Britain. Its concept of what is `truly Australian' is actually incompatible with the concept of Australia as a multicultural society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Australians fought at Gallipoli, they were proudly Australian, but equally saw Australia's interests as being closely linked with the security of the British Empire, of which they were a proud part.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no Australian defence force wide or even single service celebration of a date commemorating some action in defence of Australia's national sovereignty. The vast majority of Australians then and the vast majority of Australians today would see Anzac Day as such a celebration.</PARA>
<PARA>The attack on Anzac Day in this report is the starkest evidence of the failure of this document to have anything worth while to say about Australia identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the Australian Constitution, the Australian identity has evolved and continues to evolve. Whether the Prime Minister likes it or not, and he plainly does not, the British, Scots and English, together with the Irish, the origins of our national institutions and culture are a historical reality. We do not need to disown these foundations upon which we have built one of the world's great democratic institutions. Indeed, we should not try to sever our history at this point, to draw a veil over the past and reinvent the nation, to gratify the political whims of a prejudiced and narrow man. It is not a grand but a narrow and truncated vision which would deliberately break the threads which link the generations in this country across the years and replace emotion filled symbols as if they were brand names or logos on a packet of biscuits. </PARA>

I visited Noonkanbah, Louisa Downs and Mount Barnett. As a generalisation, I would say that the standard of the stock on these properties and the quality of the improvements on these properties are better than they ever were under white management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that were graphically illustrated to me was how out of touch we are getting with Aboriginals and Aboriginal aspirations. Everywhere I went in these communities, people told me that they were heartily sick of ATSIC and wanted nothing to do with it; that they opposed Mabo&mdash;indeed, two stations have Mabo style land claims on them; and that the high powered meeting that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had had in his office with Aboriginal people did not represent them; in fact they did not know who they were. They were very critical of the museum, which they said was distorting Aboriginal culture for its political purposes. Generally, they said, `We are Australian, we are part of Australia and we want nothing more than what everyone gets. We do not want special consideration, we want to be in the mainstream'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a view overwhelmingly of Aboriginal people; it is not the view that has been disseminated in the cities. I have said, and I am prepared to say again categorically, that any one of those gentlemen meeting with the Prime Minister in Canberra, in what was termed the highest powered meeting of Aboriginal people ever, I would be prepared to stand against at an election in Western Australia where only Aboriginal people voted and I would win convincingly. As Aboriginal people said to me, they voted for me; for them, they did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal particularly with Mount Barnett, because I think this station is a real gem. I want to pay a tribute to Billy King, the chairman of the Kupungarri community and the manager of the station. Billy is a man of the old school. He can still hot shoe a horse, and there a very few people today who could do that, and at 72 he can still ride a damn sight better than I can. I did have some salutary lessons in other places. For instance, when I was at Louisa Downs, I was talking there to Wayne Gordon, who had just finished building a set of cattle yards. The cattle yards were clearly the most workable yards I have ever seen and when I looked at them I thought to myself, `Why didn't I think of that?'. I used to build cattle yards for a living as a contractor and I can tell the House I have never built a set of cattle yards as good as those. I am determined to see that that design is recognised as the Gordon design of yards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to Mount Barnett to bring the Parliament's attention to a situation that occurred there. I have an explanatory letter to read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This paper has been dictated by Mr Billy King, Chairman of the Kupungarri Community at Mt. Barnett Station.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Billy King is a very highly respected elder of the Ngarinyin people and has passed through all stages of tribal law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is speaking out not just for himself but on behalf of other tribal elders who are greatly concerned about the actions of David Mowaljarli and others who claim a status to which they are not entitled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These elders understand that the Government and its departments would not be aware of Ngarinyin Tribal law and can easily be misled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the normal stance taken by the elders is to ignore such happenings, in this case where their own law ways are directly affected they wish to make others aware of the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any decisions concerning Ngarinyin Tribal law and the associated paintings must be made by all tribal elders together. No one person has the right to decide on such matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This arises because Mr David Mowaljarli, much feted by the press, named Australian Citizen of the Year and feted generally, received a grant from the Commonwealth Government through the State museum in Western Australia to restore Aboriginal paintings. The paintings he had in mind were very significant paintings on Mount Barnett station. So he collected some Aboriginal kids from Derby, went up there,  completely whited out the paintings and had these kids redraw them. The community knew nothing about this and was greatly affronted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This act of vandalism, for which he apparently got the Order of Australia, was just horrendous. A white person who did that would be in gaol. The community was concerned about it and actually wrote this paper, which I will not have time to read in its entirety. The community wanted the paper read out at the Congress of the Australian Rock Art Research Association which was taking place in Queensland at the time. Although they made two attempts to have it read out, that congress ignored the pleadings of these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people have set out quite clearly the traditional method of restoring those paintings. When they explain their tribal ways one is astounded at the commonsense that exists. They say that the custodian of the paintings would regularly inspect the paintings. If he himself was not an artist, he would take one with him and that artist would touch up the paintings in a traditional manner under the direct supervision of the custodian. Mr Billy King also tells how, as a youngster, he went to art class training and the elders would have all the Aboriginal kids draw pictures continually. Those that showed promise were encouraged and the others were discouraged. It is quite clear that this community has been greatly disadvantaged. A tourist attraction has been greatly reduced in value and all at the expense of taxpayers. I believe this matter does need investigating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was fobbed off at the time by the University of Western Australia, but I think one must look at the history of the University of Western Australia. The University of Western Australia in its prehistory and archaeological departments is corrupt&mdash;intellectually corrupt and maybe corrupt in other ways. For instance, I have in my possession two documents from the university's prehistory department in which it seeks to tender its services commercially to the mining industry. One of these documents says of a particular area that `it was so sacred you could not touch one single stone'. The other document says of another area that it was of so little significance that they could not get any Aboriginals interested and that they were going to clear it within 10 kilometres of the mine site. That was the Giralia goldmine site. Unfortunately, the Yakabindie mine and the Giralia mine overlap. So the University cannot have it both ways. On the one hand, they are saying, for purely political reasons, that Yakabindie was so sacred that it could not be touched but, on the other hand, that there was no interest at all in the other one. The map reading was certainly not as strong as the political agenda. That is the sort of thing we have to put up with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been approached by Aboriginals at Meekatharra who are claiming that they are being disadvantaged by what they see as the Aboriginal industry. The museum has given instructions that any mining company seeking to work in the area must consult with a particular Aboriginal. The tribal elders say, `This Aboriginal has never been initiated, knows no Aboriginal law and does not come from the area; why should he be consulted?'. They say, quite rightly, that that consultation process diminishes the status and the authority of the traditional lawgivers. I know that everywhere I go in my electorate, and I suspect it is the same Australia-wide, Aboriginals are saying, `We want to mine, we want to talk directly to the mining companies, we do not like the land councils, we want no part of them'. Yet what we seem to be doing is entrenching the authority of the land councils. Why would we not? When one looks at the Aboriginal industry in Australia one looks at a $2 billion industry&mdash;a bit more than $1 billion from the Commonwealth Government and a little less from the States. If one is to ask whether the policy of Aboriginal Affairs has been for the benefit of Aboriginal people, one would have to be very dubious about it. Indeed, it is my view that the policy of Aboriginal Affairs was never designed for that purpose. It was designed to placate affluent, urban, white middle-class guilt, and to that end it has been highly successful. It has been so successful that people are now saying, `All this money we spend on Aboriginals and nothing gets better; they are hopeless, they are no-hopers'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I pay tribute to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I think it is the finest and most rational address on Aboriginal affairs I have heard since I listened to Fred Hollows some six years ago when I did not even know who he was. I watched him on television one night and thought, `This bloke really knows what he is talking about', and so did the previous speaker. I am here to give an identical speech, strangely enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We passed land rights legislation in Queensland in 1984 and God was good to me in giving me the privilege of being the Minister when those laws were passed. I want to read some names into the record: from Hopevale we got advice from the Rosendales, the Gibsons, the Pearsons, the Deerals and the Deemals; from Pormpuraaw the Shortjoes and the Holroyds; from the Torres Strait the legendary George Mye and Getano Lui; from Yarrabah the Alfie Neals, the Roy Grays and the Mick Connollys; and from other places the Eric Laws, the Les Stewarts and Tommy Geias. We also got advice from Frank Brennan, the very prominent priest who has been active in these areas, and from the Anglican, Catholic and Lutheran churches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we passed the legislation in Queensland&mdash;the community services Act 1984 and the Land Act (Aboriginal and Islander Grants) Amendment Act 1984&mdash;we were not criticised in any way as the Queensland Government, but we were not praised either. What we had done was viewed with very great suspicion because we had a history of not getting on well with people of Aboriginal descent. However, as time went on and people began to understand the implications of what had happened, we were lauded. In fact, some 20,000 people turned out for the handing-over ceremony when the Aboriginal people, after three, four and five generations, once again owned their land. We are talking about a very significant amount of land in Queensland&mdash;seven million acres&mdash;and it is not desert country. Almost all of it is country with an above 40-inch rainfall, and it is some of the most valuable land in Queensland&mdash;Yarrabah adjoins Cairns, of course&mdash;so it was an extremely valuable resource that was being handed over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that we were not in the business of land rights in the sense that we were taking land off somebody else and giving it to these people. This was land that they had traditionally and legally owned, as was recognised by successive governments in the State of Queensland. No-one could argue in any meaningful sense that this land was not theirs. We passed those laws and the net result was that in the community stores the profits went from a loss of $408,000 a year to a profit of $924,000 a year, and the cattle turn-off leapt from 965 a year to 5,835 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crayfishing industry&mdash;and I must stress that these are soft but I think accurate figures&mdash;went from $0.3 million to $7 million. The turnover at Masig Island in fishing went from $14,000 to $291,000. The number of privately owned businesses operated by people of Aboriginal descent went from three to 52. The number of community services employees&mdash;those were predominantly people of white descent&mdash;was cut by some 21 per cent, and the number of jobs created in the building program alone was 328. So it was a magnificent success story. The trauma rates halved. The rioting stopped completely. In fact, in the last five years that I was Minister not one single riot took place in any community. Let me make a very valid comparison and put teeth in the remarks made by the previous speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two examples are Aurukun, which was under total white control and effectively under the control of the Federal Government, and Pormpuraaw, which was effectively under the control of the local council and black people. Aurukun started with 12,500 head of cattle. In five years there was not one solitary head of cattle left on Aurukun. Pormpuraaw started with 326 cattle on the books. In five years they ended up with 6,000 head of cattle on the books. That proves two things: one, that if people are given a fair go and if they are given the same rights and privileges as other Australians, they can perform just as successfully. That is living proof of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who question what I am saying, let me point out that we had the honour&mdash;to some degree, I suppose&mdash;when the Pope visited Australia of an address from him at Alice Springs, in which he advocated the introduction of the laws that existed in Queensland with respect to lands. Of course, the person drafting those laws was Father Brennan, whom I referred to earlier, who would have made the recommendations in the notes for the Pope's speech. Our Premier, Joe Bjelke-Petersen, who was not always an admirer of the Pope, I might add, rather coyly observed that everyone should take the Holy Father's advice and implement the same laws as Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not what I want to talk about today. What I want to talk about today is what happened. What happened to this success story? What happened to the vicious venom and hatred that now abides in the community?

To explain that I must quote from the Queensland <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the current financial year the Federal Government will spend some $800m on Aboriginal affairs throughout Australia.

I refer to the case of Mabo and Others v. the State of Queensland and the Commonwealth of Australia, which is currently before the High Court of Australia and the Supreme Court of Queensland. I am advised by the Crown Solicitor that the plaintiffs' instructing solicitor in this case is Mr Greg McIntyre, who is no less than the principal legal officer of the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia. Mr McIntyre is now recognised in Western Australia and in the High Court's jurisdiction as barrister and solicitor. He continues to act as solicitor for the plaintiffs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Watch the blood pressure. I have a number of community health centres in my electorate; and there are three, in Collingwood, Fitzroy and Carlton, which recently, as a result of the actions of the Kennett Government, have suffered a combined cut in their funding of over $1 million out of a total funding level of $1.9 million. In other words, these centres, which perform a</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>very valuable role for the people of those communities, have suffered funding cuts of over 50 per cent. If one takes into account the fact that there is a significant fixed cost in running any organisation of this nature, the real funding cut is probably of the order of 70 per cent or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This funding cut has been based on a totally spurious analysis of the distribution of services in the health sector across the metropolitan area, based on a dubious notion that the inner suburbs are overserviced. What the analysis it is based on has failed to recognise is that there are a substantial number of State-wide or regional services located in those areas and they are assumed to be, in effect, the same as a purely localised service. It also ignores the fact that, in areas like Fitzroy, Collingwood and areas of that nature in my electorate, there is inevitably a substantially high level of demand for the sorts of services that community health centres provide. There are in-built extra costs, for example, because of the need for interpreters to be provided because there are substantially higher levels of non-English speaking background people using those services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it was put to me in a meeting the other night by one of the key figures in the Fitzroy health service, what this exercise illustrates more than anything else is that if you torture the figures for long enough you can get any result you like; they will confess to anything. That is precisely what is happening in Victoria under the Kennett Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These health centres play a very important role in their local communities. They are crucial to the pursuit of preventive medicine strategies in a variety of areas. They play a very important role in education on issues such as nutrition and fitness, on the reduction of smoking, on prevention of AIDS and a variety of other issues, and they manage to reach communities that are very often impervious to other education strategies in these sorts of areas. So, although the effect of these educative programs will not show up in any accountant's analysis of the budgetary provisions for the health sector, in the long term we are going to see in our community substantial improvements in many areas in cases of heart disease, lung cancer and the like, because of the work of these community health centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They operate often in areas that are very poorly serviced by the private sector. In Collingwood, for example, there is a very limited presence of the private medical sector and the Collingwood health service plays a dominant role in the provision of GP services in that area. They are staffed universally, in my experience, by people who are dedicated to the work that they are performing, who are not there to make a buck, and the doctors in particular are deserving of the highest praise for the long hours and the hard work that they do for remuneration that ultimately ends up being less than what they can get elsewhere, in many cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, they provide a very important focus of integration of people of recent migrant origin into our community. In the case of the Fitzroy community health centre and the Hmong people who have recently migrated in substantial numbers to Australia, involvement with that health centre has been an important focus through which that particular people have managed to reach out to other areas of the community and other sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community health centres account for only a tiny proportion of the total health budget in the State of Victoria and yet you have got a situation where some of the heaviest cuts, far out of proportion to what is occurring in many other areas of the health budget, are being imposed on these centres. Recently we saw over 500 people demonstrating on the basis of the cuts to the Fitzroy community health centre in the streets of Melbourne. That illustrates that these centres do have strong community support and there is certainly strong activity going on within my electorate to seek to turn around the actions of the Kennett Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many conservative elements in the health bureaucracy, in the medical profession and elsewhere that do not like community health centres. They were, of course, an initiative of the Whitlam Government&mdash;one of the greatest governments this country has ever seen. They pursue an ethos of preventive medicine, in contrast to the pursuit of high technology toys that seems to be all the vogue in many areas, and they pursue an ethos of community involvement that is critical in many of those disadvantaged communities in the inner suburbs. </PARA>

They would like some response back from the Government, if it can provide such a response, as to whether funding is being provided. It is a concern to the electorate and the Vietnamese community in the electorate because they do care about their previous homeland and they do care about the human rights that are lacking in that country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell honourable members that today will represent the 10th day on which the House of Representatives of Australia has sat in a total period of eight months. It is a measure of the Keating Government's respect for the institutions of Australia&mdash;and parliament and Question Time are great Australian institutions. This Prime Minister's contempt for the great institutions of the Australian nation is represented by that unassailable statistic that in a total period of eight months&mdash;at a time of this country's greatest economic crisis since World War II, with our highest level of unemployment since the years of the Great Depression and when the Australian people are wanting sensible, moderate, intelligent, modest leadership&mdash;the House has sat only two weeks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a very interesting session; it was a fascinating session. I remember it very well. That was an occasion where we did not have a Question Time because there was a precise, atypical reason for Parliament being convened. But today's sitting of Parliament is part and parcel of the regular pattern of parliamentary sittings under the Keating Government. We on this side of the House&mdash;and I believe many hundreds of thousands of Australians&mdash;want to know why government members are so gutless that they will not face Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have those opposite got to hide from? Are they concerned that they will be asked more questions about the Auditor-General's report? Are they frightened that those Ministers in their Government who want to dump the income tax cuts, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> this morning, might say so under questioning? Are they concerned about a Question Time that will expose the further incompetence of their Ministry on such matters as pay television and other communications issues? Why is it that they are so scared of having a Question Time? Why are they junking something that they know, as well as I do, is an inviolate part of the normal pattern of normal sittings in a parliamentary system of government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House, who is at the table, knows better than most in this Parliament that there are certain conventions and traditions. We can cop in proper circumstances a situation where a government will say, `Look, we can't give you a Question Time', but there can be no earthly justification according to the conventions of this Parliament for the Government to knock off Question Time today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only explanation can be found in the attitude of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, be it remembered, is the man who, 2 1/2 years ago, stood opposite where I am at the dispatch box and said, `Mr Speaker, Question Time is a courtesy extended by the Executive to the Parliament'. I repeat: `a courtesy extended by the Executive to the Parliament'. That was a measure of just how contemptuous the Prime Minister of this country is towards the great institutions of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is the great destroyer of institutions in this country; he is the great divider of Australia. He is never happy until he divides one Australian against another. If ever a leader of this country had no natural instinct for unity and healing, it is the present Prime Minister of this country. If ever a Prime Minister of this country believed in setting interest group against interest group, class against class, people of different ethnic origin against people of another different ethnic origin, it is the Prime Minister of this country. He is the greatest trader in division and contempt for the great institutions of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, surely if you believe in an essential democracy, what earthly right, what earthly objection can anybody possibly have to the proposition that the majority party in the Parliament will respect the right of the minority party in the Parliament for 45 minutes every time the Parliament sits to question the Leader of the Government and to question the Ministers in that government? But not even that fundamental right is respected by this man because he believes that when you have got the numbers you use those brutally, without any care for the rights of those who have not got the numbers. That might be popular in Sussex Street; it might go down well at a meeting of the Right Wing caucus of the ALP, but I do not think it goes down very well in the highways and byways of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is redolent of a man who believes in bringing Australia together; I do not think it is redolent of a man who believes in uniting and healing and not dividing and wounding. That is what the Prime Minister of this country represents&mdash;he represents the wounding of people and the dividing of people, and unutterable contempt for the great institutions of this country. And he has demonstrated it again today by his jackbooted approach to Question Time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to remind the House of a couple of parallels to this situation. Not so long ago in this Parliament a Prime Minister was carved up by his own Caucus. That was Bob Hawke. That was a pretty critical, moving and historical day. It happened during a call back session of the House of Representatives in December 1991, on the very day that those opposite carved up Bob Hawke as Leader of the Australian Labor Party, as Prime Minister of Australia, at their Caucus meeting that afternoon; nevertheless, the Government proceeded with Question Time on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Prime Minister, that man who was less than arrogant compared with the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that person who had spent less time in parliament but who awards and acknowledges the convention of parliament far more than most, allowed Question Time to proceed that day as the honourable gentleman that he was whilst those opposite were carving him up behind his very back. During Question Time some of them walked across to him, shook his hand and said, `Bob, I am sorry, I am now switching to the Keating camp', as the countdown went on that very afternoon. The Government allowed Question Time on that red-letter day, but it will not allow Question Time on this the 75th day after the polling events of 13 March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that the Government won the election on 13 March. But I also accept that the Government has lost the plot on just about every day since 13 March. This arrogant Government is at a stalemate, in hibernation, unable to produce an agenda to deal with the economy, unable to produce an agenda to deal with the unemployed, unable to produce an agenda to deal with the record drought ripping apart so much of country Australia, unable to produce an agenda to deal with the wool industry crisis on a long-term strategic basis and unable to really provide united and cohesive leadership to this great country Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say, `Shame on the Government for its tactics here today'. Those opposite should hang their heads in absolute shame for having taken this course of action. I know how much it will annoy them, but try one more dimension as to why they did not have Question Time today. Overnight Brigadier Alf Garland put on record the absolutely correct happenings when the Prime Minister came off that stage at that Battle of the Coral Sea function.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dick Cheney was nowhere near the Prime Minister or Brigadier Alf Garland. Dick Cheney was being escorted around by Sir Eric Neal. Yesterday, the Prime Minister effectively misled the House. He in fact bumped into Alf Garland. Alf Garland took a proper action. I must say it is a regrettable occasion when the Prime Minister of this country cannot even support the flag of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I simply say to the House that it is time that the Government thought again about its arrogance, that it allowed Question Time to resume and that it allowed the MPI to proceed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me just assist the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), the previous speaker, on a couple of technical details before dealing with the arguments, in so far as they can be characterised as arguments, put by him and the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Howard). That the daily program says what it does is what happens whether or not there is to be a Question Time. If he actually talks to the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), whom I know he has a difficulty sitting down and having a civil chat with, he would point out that, whether or not Question Time were going to take place this day, this is what would have appeared there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am surprised at him because he is his pea. He is the person that he was rather hoping would come through and replace his leader in the fullness of time. He no doubt hoped very much that he himself&mdash;indeed, if the National Party had been sensible it would have been the case&mdash;would have been in leadership until the time came to pass the baton to himself. He has a very high opinion of him, and that is not an unreasonable assessment on his part. But he should not feel he needs to get in behind his leader on this occasion because his leader, despite his lengthy service in the New South Wales Parliament and his reasonably lengthy service here, has absolutely no understanding of how an agenda paper is prepared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a technical argument. I will go through the technical details of it and answer the points he made. Far from the Government at the last minute racing in and panicking about Question Time&mdash;which is the point he is trying to make, I assume, by starting off with that technical point in his statement&mdash;that is merely the way all these matters are handled. The normal process of the day is left standing and when it comes to Question Time the Leader of the House stands up and asks that questions be placed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. That is normally how you suspend Question Time. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, normal. I will talk a little bit more about the normality of suspending Question Time when I get on to that. The honourable member also alleged that I had promised him a Question Time. In answer to the Opposition's spokesman, let me read exactly what I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is likely that there will be two Question Times, but I am not absolutely certain about the Thursday. It would depend a bit on the pressure of business from the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the point that I made at that time. I did not give him an undertaking that he was going to have two Question Times. No reasonable reading of that statement would indicate that that would be the case. That is the second technical point the honourable member decided to raise in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now deal with a third point that he decided to put forward. He spoke in glowing and friendly terms of the former Prime Minister of this country&mdash;terms that he was unable to manage, I note, when he was in office; nevertheless, he did speak in glowing terms of him earlier. Let me mention what happens at this point of time when we have these two days of sittings at the conclusion of the period when we come back to clean up items of business that have been handled by the Senate for us. On 17 December 1992, that was the case. Of course, he was not in office then. That was last year. It also occurred on 21 June 1991, 21 December 1990 and on 16 June 1989. In fact, ever since the implementation of the Macklin motion in the Senate&mdash;even though that has now been removed from the Senate it has been effectively maintained in the conduct of the business of the Senate&mdash;we have been put in a position where we have these two clean up days at the end of the process. That Macklin motion has been in place since 1988 or thereabouts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why, somewhat innovatively I suppose, these two days of sittings have grown up. By and large on these two days there is one Question Time. So do not come into this place and say that this is some sort of unprecedented move by the Government disturbed about what the Opposition is doing in this place. Do not think that in the period of office of the Opposition that there were automatic Question Times when the pressure of business in the House dictated that there should not be. Let me go through the record from 1976 to 1982: 79 days sittings in 1976 and 73 days Question Time; 68 days sittings in 1977 and 62 days Question Time; 75 days sittings in 1978 and 68 days Question Time; 68 days sittings in 1979 and 63 days Question Time; 51 days sittings in 1980&mdash;that was a vintage year&mdash;and 50 days Question Time; 62 days sittings in 1981 and 58 days Question Time; and 53 days sittings in 1982 and 46 days Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just because the Opposition has missed out on one day of Question Time in this block of sittings, it need not come into this place thinking that somehow or other the Government is acting in some terribly deceitful, frightened and unprecedented fashion. It is not as though the practice has not been previously adopted in this House by this Government or by those opposite when they happened to be in office and it suited the convenience of the House not to have a Question Time on particular days.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not dealing with any unprecedented behaviour on the part of the Government. We are dealing with a government operating as it normally does when it has to clean up the legislation at the end of a sitting period and it wants the opportunity to devote its time to the consideration of government business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a difference between what is happening now and what happened in the period to which I referred earlier&mdash;when those opposite were in government and we sat without the benefit of Question Time about a tenth of the time&mdash;and the difference is this: this debate has been preceded by 4 1/2 hours of private members' business. Even though the Government has basically called back the Parliament to deal with government business&mdash;important government business&mdash;for the remainder of this day, we did not touch that 4 1/2 hours of time set aside for private members. Throughout that 4 1/2 hours of time it was possible for private members on both sides of the House and for frontbenchers on the other side of the House to raise issues connected with the economy, pay TV, or any feature of government business they would like to raise. In that 4 1/2 hours there was massive opportunity for that to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government would now like a few hours for government business in order to clean up material forthcoming from the Senate, and we will assume for ourselves exactly the same privileges that those opposite assumed for themselves when they were in government and had to deal with the exigencies of government legislation from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further reason for the arrangement, and that is the reason related to the position in the Senate. Ever since the adoption of the Macklin motion, this type of pressure has been exerted even more intensely on the government. Because we have respect for the parliamentary institution, that puts us in a double-squeeze play; once, because we acknowledge the force of the Macklin motion and have a parliamentary sitting that responds to that; and, twice, because we have allowed the time allotted to private members' business to be inviolate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody could have sat in this chamber for the 10 years that this Government has been in office&mdash;nobody could have sat in here&mdash;and said that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is fearful of Question Time. Nobody could have sat in this chamber yesterday and said that the Prime Minister was fearful of Question Time. As I recollect the events of yesterday, the Prime Minister stood up and had members of the Opposition so agitated that they went positively feral for the bulk of the afternoon. Far from the Prime Minister being fearful, they were feral. As a result, we did not get all the business done that we might have yesterday, nor as expeditiously as we might have got it done, and that was thanks to them. That was not the Prime Minister being fearful; it was the Prime Minister driving them feral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that. We understand why they should feel feral about it. They have not asked him a question since he has been on the front bench. They have directed questions to everyone else, but they have been leaving him alone. Why? Because, far from him being frightened by them, they are frightened by him. No questions about the Auditor-General were raised; nothing about the Auditor-General was directed to the Prime Minister&mdash;nothing at all. The matter was directed to everybody else but not to the Prime Minister. The Opposition had seven questions to put to the Prime Minister about the Auditor-General but it did not feel like putting them to the Prime Minister yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is relief across the Opposition's front bench because they do not have to have another discussion with the Prime Minister about the shenanigans that they have engaged in with the legislation in the Senate.

<PARA>In January 1988 the Government established the Defence Housing Authority as the first step towards providing a better standard and an increased choice of housing for defence personnel and their families.

<PARA>HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterhen</EMPHASIS> is the national mine warfare base for the Royal Australian Navy and is located at Balls Head Bay at Waverton in New South Wales, some four kilometres north of the Sydney central business district. Existing facilities and services date back to late 1940. A number of demountable buildings and transportable containers have been provided over the years to supplement facilities pending modernisation. The age and poor condition of existing facilities necessitate replacement or major specific repair to continue operational activities and to provide for future mine warfare capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various proposals have been considered and developed for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterhen</EMPHASIS> site over a period of about 10 years. In May 1991 the Defence Force structure programs and policy committee endorsed a high priority for the modernisation of the existing <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterhen</EMPHASIS> mine warfare base. This proposal is to provide purpose-built facilities for the developing Royal Australian Navy mine countermeasure capability. The scope of the work provides for continuous Navy operations throughout the construction implementation period and includes an operations and administration building, supply and diving centres, a workshop building, a transport compound, flammable materials and explosives storage, and all associated site works and services. The estimated total cost of the works is $73 million at December 1992 prices, which equates to an out-turn cost of $79 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report, the committee recommended that the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterhen</EMPHASIS> facilities modernisation at Waverton, New South Wales, should proceed, but raised the following specific issues. The final design of the proposed car park will need to reflect its environmentally sensitive location. Defence should ensure that personnel to be employed at the redeveloped base use public transport to the maximum extent possible. Defence agrees with the conclusions and recommendations of the committee. Construction work on the site is expected to commence by January 1994 and, due to the need to keep the base operational, construction will be staged with completion due by August 1997.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not a new or unique happening in this place, as the Assistant Treasurer seems to understand. However, it does serve once again to point out the folly of the way we legislate in this chamber as distinct from what happens in the Senate. I have said it before, and it is equally true in this context: the Senate is the only true legislative chamber in the Parliament. Despite all the denigration that is heaped upon it by those opposite who would like to see it cease to exist, we can be thankful that it does legislate conscientiously. Mostly, that conscientiousness is due to the very fine work of the coalition in opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

The committee will be aware, of course, that when the Bill first came in it was debated under the guillotine. There was no possible chance that we could go into committee to suggest precise amendments, although I did forewarn that what is happening now would in fact happen; that is, once again the tax legislation, after it had been considered in the Senate, would come back here for amendment. It should not be necessary for that to happen. It is a most inefficient way of going about getting tax legislation through the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the immigration area there are certain fundamental entry requirements which apply across all immigration categories. These requirements include health character screening and, for some cases, assessment for settlement purposes. In all these classes, except diplomatic or short-term medical treatment categories, the criteria for entry or stay include a health requirement; and these are very important requirements for ensuring that the Australian public interest is protected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry by the committee focused on applicants for migration or permanent residence who were refused entry or stay on grounds that they suffer from a prescribed disease, medical condition or a disability. The committee's main brief was to determine whether or not any such applicants could be allowed to enter or remain in Australia on a conditional basis. The committee considered at length the adequacy of the existing health rules as they pertain to migration and consulted with a wide range of community organisations and individuals as well as government agencies responsible for administering the migration program and its health components. In particular, the committee considered the various concerns which were expressed about the lack of flexibility in the existing health rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report, the committee has made a series of recommendations aimed at clarifying the existing provisions on the health requirement and, in particular, the committee sought to remove the perception that the health rules operate against disabled persons in a discriminatory way. The committee did seek that the Minister exercise a greater judgment in terms of his capacity to make discretionary decisions on waiver of these health conditions in particular cases. The committee was of the view that there ought to be greater flexibility in the way in which the existing system operates. The committee has emphasised the need to take into consideration the likely contribution which individuals and families make to the Australian community as well as their ability to meet the costs of treatment and care arising from the medical condition or disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also came to the view that, associated with this latter matter, where discretion was inappropriate for exercise, the Minister might be in a position to impose a charge upon the likely applicant to meet the costs which would be independently ascertained and which would be paid up front to enable people to be able to access Australia if they had come under a category of, say, business entry or family reunion; and, where one person within a family unit suffered a particular disability that might impose a cost, that cost could be quantified, met, and then the person allowed entry to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These suggestions are very helpful. I am aware of many more cases that have been brought to public notice of individuals where the application of this discretion or the implementation of these particular suggestions would give the department greater flexibility and would enable, I think, the Government to respond in a way which was seen to be more humane and sensible. But I would have to say also that during the course of the inquiry issues related to the management of the health regulations, such as screening for diseases and fraud within the Medicare system, were also brought to the committee's attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was very alarmed at the way in which some sections of our health system, and particularly the Medicare arrangements, could be utilised by people who were temporarily in Australia and have no entitlement under the rules to access the system. The committee made a number of suggestions as to the way in which that might be addressed. It is a matter of urgent and pressing need if there is any concern about the cost of health to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say on behalf of the committee that its thanks go to its subcommittee chairman, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), for the amount of work and effort that he put into this inquiry in particular. The committee was particularly grateful also for the committee specialist adviser, Dr Kathryn Cronin, whose valuable advice and assistance was appreciated greatly. Thanks are also due to the committee secretary, Andres Lomp, as well as Clifford Lawson and his predecessor, Cheryl Samuels, as well as Cassandra Paulus, and Dianne Fraser, who were involved with this work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of the committee's recommendations in this report will contribute towards a fairer system which is flexible enough to allow conditional entry for some who have a disability or a medical condition, without endangering public health or placing an undue burden upon Australia, its facilities and resources. I commend the report to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945. The amendments will allow the Governor-General in Council to make regulations allowing for more comprehensive implementation of Australia's obligations under the United Nations charter than existing legislation permits. They also provide for the imposition of fines for breach of the regulations and allow the Attorney-General to seek injunctions to restrain such a breach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Cold War era, the rivalry between the Soviet Union and the Western powers meant that the Security Council was seriously hampered in addressing international crises. The end of the Cold War has seen the council begin to function in the way the founders of the United Nations envisaged it would. It has taken action in regard to a number of the world's most troublesome conflicts&mdash;in the Persian Gulf, in Cambodia, in Somalia and in the Balkan conflict, to name some of the most prominent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases the Security Council has determined that the imposition of economic sanctions is necessary in order to bring to an end a breach of international peace and security. In recent times, such sanctions have been imposed against Iraq, Libya and Yugoslavia&mdash;Serbia and Montenegro. A failure by member states of the United Nations to implement those sanctions would inevitably erode respect for and the authority of those decisions. It is therefore important that Australia play its part in strengthening international peace and security by placing itself in a position fully to implement obligations that may arise from measures mandated by Security Council decisions. Further, Australia, as a member of the United Nations, is required as a matter of international law by article 25 of the charter to implement those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions generally decide that `states shall prevent' specified transactions with the offending state. Australia's obligations under such resolutions have previously been implemented by way of the making of regulations under the Customs Act 1901, the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Banking Act 1959 and the Migration Act 1958 and by way of appropriate directions issued by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Until now, the Australian Government has been able to use those methods to implement, directly or indirectly, sanctions mandated by the United Nations against Iraq and Libya and those mandated against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&mdash;Serbia and Montenegro&mdash;last year. However, recent events have shown that this ad hoc utilisation of legislation designed to be used for other purposes is no longer adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Security Council adopted resolution 820 on 17 April 1993. The resolution provides for the imposition of strict new sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as from 26 April. The Government has been advised that Australia lacks a legislative basis by which it could ensure compliance with the obligations imposed by the resolution in a number of important respects, for example, the freezing of funds held in Australia by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or companies based in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Nor, under existing legislation, can the Government prevent Australian individuals or firms from providing services&mdash;such as accounting services or the installation of computer software&mdash;to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The High Court held as long ago as 1973 that the Commonwealth did not have the executive power to cut off the telephone and mail services of the Rhodesian Information Bureau in Sydney, pursuant to a Security Council resolution. A failure to comply with the resolution would place Australia in breach of its international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In examining its options in relation to the implementation of those sanctions, the Government had regard to the ways in which other countries have done so. The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand have had facilitating legislation in place since the 1940s designed to allow a quick response to an obligation to implement Security Council sanctions. The Canadian and New Zealand legislation are particularly close in their wording to that proposed in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central provision in the Bill before honourable members is the insertion of a new section 6 in the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945. The section will enable the Governor-General in Council to make such regulations as are necessary or convenient for applying measures adopted by the Security Council pursuant to chapter VII of the charter. The Government will thereby be able to implement promptly by way of regulation economic sanctions introduced by the Security Council. As honourable members would be aware, the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances agreed in its 93rd report of December 1992 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Scrutiny of regulations imposing United Nations sanctions</EMPHASIS> that it was appropriate that Australia's obligations under Security Council resolutions be implemented by way of regulation. The reason for their conclusion was the need for speed and flexibility in the implementation of the sanctions and the fact that the regulations merely filled out the details of Australia's existing international legal obligation to comply with the sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will be based on the external affairs power of the Commonwealth. It is not intended that the legislation replace existing regulations: rather, it will enable the Governor-General in Council to make regulations dealing with situations which fall outside the present regulatory framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will not have the effect of taking away from the Government or the Parliament the power to decide whether the imposition of sanctions against a particular foreign state is in Australia's national interests. It would only be after the making of regulations under the legislation, which would be subject to the normal provisions regarding disallowance in the Parliament, that sanctions would be implemented. It would be open to persons aggrieved by a decision to make particular regulations to claim that their making was neither necessary nor convenient for applying measures adopted by the Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments to the Act are directed to ensuring that regulations made under the Act as amended will properly implement Australia's international legal obligations. The proposed section 3 will ensure that regulations implementing Australia's obligations under the charter can be enforced in Australia's external territories. The proposed section 4 makes it clear that the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth and of the States and Territories is bound by any regulations made pursuant to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Security Council resolutions may provide that member states of the United Nations shall prevent their nationals from engaging in specified conduct. Section 7 will allow the Government to implement such provisions effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wording of section 8 reflects the fact that the sanctions introduced by regulation are those currently mandated by decisions of the Security Council. Once the Security Council decides that sanctions against a particular state are no longer necessary, it would obviously be inappropriate for the regulations implementing those sanctions to remain in force. Whilst prompt action will be taken to repeal or amend the regulations formally in line with the decision of the Security Council, this section will make it clear that they cease to have effect as soon as the sanctions are lifted by the Security Council. It also makes it clear that the Government may decide, consistent with the position regarding the introduction of sanctions, that the continued implementation of particular sanctions is no longer in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the position that we are obliged by international law to give effect to decisions of the Security Council, the proposed new sections 9 and 10 are intended to guarantee that regulations implementing sanctions are not read subject to existing legislation nor later found to have been accidentally repealed by subsequent legislative action. Unless such provision is made, Australia could inadvertently find itself in breach of its international legal obligations and be subject to international criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated earlier, the Government has previously implemented, and will continue to implement, United Nations sanctions by way of regulations under the Customs Act, the Air Navigation Act, the Banking Act and the Migration Act. Doing so confers substantial advantages in regard to the administration of the regulations and the imposition of more appropriate penalties than are available under this Bill. This Bill is intended to supplement, not replace, that existing pattern of legislation and regulation. Section 11 makes it clear that regulations made under the legislation referred to above will continue in force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill includes provisions for penalties for breach of regulations made under it and for the Attorney-General to seek injunctions to prohibit prospective breaches of the regulations. The Bill will come into force on royal assent. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is facilitating the passage of the Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill by debating it now rather than seeking to adjourn it to another day. This course is being followed because of the measure of agreement in relation to the Bill and its purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that, unlike many other debates, it is no longer incumbent upon me to try to explain what the legislation is about in order for it to be seen as a coherent discussion; save for me to say that the Bill does authorise changes to the Charter of United Nations Act 1945 which will allow the government of the day to implement fully, by regulation, sanctions agreed to by the United Nations Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition welcomes a reinvigorated role for the United Nations. With the ending of the Cold War and superpower rivalry as we knew it, we have seen a revival in relevant and useful international organisations. UN members will be expected to assume greater responsibility for maintaining and enhancing global stability. To achieve this goal the United Nations needs to have a structural and bureaucratic system coupled with our own. There is an increasing demand for the UN, in exercising its peacekeeping function, to be able to respond in a prompt and efficient way and there are growing demands upon Australia, many reports of which we have seen of late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a difficult time for the international community. In this period after the Cold War it has been much more difficult to establish the `new world order' than many of us might have envisaged. Many ethnic, communal, religious and national conflicts seem to have broken out and replaced the former major superpower tensions in a way which has had quite unfortunate repercussions upon individuals. Nevertheless, we have seen a great deal of ingenuity in trying to deal with these situations. There has been a great deal of effort to minimise some of the brutality that has emerged in quite highly complex and difficult situations which are the result of many past international circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the coalition supports the international community, through its international body the United Nations, in doing all that it can to cope with these difficulties. Therefore, we support strongly the commitment of Australia as a part of the United Nations. We have often commended Australia's contribution to the peacekeeping forces throughout the world. It is timely to note that Australian military forces have made a very worthwhile contribution in Somalia, from which they are just now returning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have personally witnessed the work of our defence forces in Cambodia. My parliamentary colleagues the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) are both presently in Cambodia monitoring the process by which elections are being undertaken. Hopefully, the outcome of those elections will restore some element of stability to that country. No matter what we think about the process and the effectiveness of the plans of many individuals who have tried to bring about a peaceful outcome, it is important to recognise Australia's contribution to that peacekeeping function through its defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I visited Cambodia last year and met with some of the defence personnel who were stationed not only in Phnom Penh but also in many quite difficult locations. I travelled north-west to Kompong Thom where people have been injured and shot and where there has been a contest between the Khmer Rouge and the forces of the state of Cambodia. In the middle of that difficult situation Australian forces are playing a part in ensuring successful communication between the combatants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Opposition accept that the international community has a number of different tools at its disposal to try to bring conflict to an end. Inducements can be offered and diplomacy can play a part; but in some circumstances the international community needs to apply pressure in the form of arms embargos, economic sanctions and the placement of forces, as we saw in relation to Somalia. Ultimately, that pressure might involve a substantial military force, as we saw in the case of Iraq. It is important that the Government of Australia have a reasonably free hand in meeting our international responsibilities in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that sense, we support the provisions which move us beyond the old regulations in the Customs Act, the Air Navigation Act, the Banking Act and the Migration Act, which have served us well but no longer prove adequate to enable a new sanctions regime to be fully implemented. This Bill is also intended to ensure that sanctions-related regulations are enforced in our external territories, that the States and Territories are also bound and that the Government has the power to prevent Australian nationals from engaging in conduct prohibited under its sanctions obligations. They are an important part of a total regime if it is to be put in place. I notice that the legislation which operates in other countries is similar to this legal regime that the Government has in mind to implement through this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill has come about largely in response to the recent developments to which Australia has found itself unable to respond in a timely fashion. On 17 April 1993 the UN Security Council adopted resolution 820, which provides for the implementation of reinforced sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&mdash;that is Serbia and Montenegro&mdash;as from 26 April. If we are to respond to those provisions it is important that this regime be in place. That is part of the reason why we are facilitating discussion in relation to this legislation. I make the point also that its broader application will enable the Government to respond rapidly and with flexibility in the implementation of other possible sanctions regimes. That, I think, makes it a desirable objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will not only close gaps in the sanctions regime that has previously applied using the Acts that have been mentioned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) but also allow future government to move rapidly on sanctions once they are imposed. This is an increasingly important consideration as national economies are even more interlocked than in the past; also in an environment of instantaneous international economic transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcomed the Minister's emphasis that this legislation had been the subject of comment by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances which, in its 93rd report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Scrutiny of regulations imposing United Nations sanctions</EMPHASIS>, agreed that it was appropriate that Australia's obligations be implemented by way of regulation. The explanatory memorandum to this Bill quite properly emphasises:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation will not have the effect of taking away from the Government the power to decide whether the imposition of sanctions against a particular foreign state is in Australia's national interests. It would only be after the making of regulations under the legislation, which would be subject to the normal provisions regarding disallowance in the Parliament, that sanctions would be implemented. It would be open to persons aggrieved by a decision to make particular regulations to claim that their making was neither necessary nor convenient for applying measures adopted by the Security Council.</PARA>
<PARA>In the wisdom of the Parliament, if there were not a unanimity of view it would be possible for either House&mdash;the Senate or the House of Representatives&mdash;to deny those regulations. This may impose a greater obligation upon us as members of parliament to scrutinise what goes on here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that sense, I welcome the advice as to disallowable instruments that is now provided on a regular basis by the Clerks. It enables us to monitor accurately the timetable which permits the moving of a motion to disallow a regulation. In that sense, it enhances our skills in being able to fulfil our duties effectively where these matters are involved and there is frequent recourse to regulations because of the need for flexibility and speed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the Parliament itself maintain an ongoing interest in these matters and that the people who have a particular concern&mdash;and numbers of people do&mdash;about the scope and activities of the United Nations are aware that there is this potential to be able to move in relation to these matters should such a situation arise. I am sure, in the knowledge of the importance of these matters and Australia's reputation, that the Government will move in this area only with due diligence and after appropriate inquiry. But the assurance that these matters cannot be dealt with without public scrutiny is an important one&mdash;one which I note the regime permits to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have foreshadowed, the Opposition does not oppose the passage of this legislation. It is important, in view of the need to implement resolution 820, that we are able to act on these matters promptly. Because of what has been happening in the former republic of Yugoslavia, I have an ongoing concern that Australia is playing as full a role as possible. I do not think any Australian would not be moved by the events that have taken place in that tragic group of countries and not want to see Australia playing a very positive role&mdash;albeit whether one considers that the steps taken by the international community to date have been either adequate or appropriate. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join with my colleagues on both sides of the House in supporting the Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill 1993 and recommending it to the House. The purpose of this Bill is basically to tidy up and tighten the capacity of the Australian Government to implement sanctions decisions that are made by the United Nations Security Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill amends the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 and, through this amendment, gives the Government power to regulate for the implementation of sanctions. At the moment the Government has the power to implement sanctions, but it must utilise a range of other legislation&mdash;the Customs Act, the Air Navigation Act, the Banking Act and the Migration Act&mdash;and within those regulations there are still loopholes in areas of commerce, industry or business dealings between Australia and other nations that cannot be fully covered. Through the amendments in this legislation, we are able to tighten that up. Of course, it does not replace the regulatory process of those other Bills; it is designed to complement them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important that we record in this House some comment about the United Nations and Australia's involvement in it. Australia has had a very long and proud history of involvement not only in the work of the United Nations but also in its formation. It was the Labor foreign Minister&mdash;or External Affairs Minister as I think he was called at that time&mdash;Dr Evatt who played a very important role in the formation of the United Nations and in fact was the first President of the General Assembly. I think he earned that honour because of the important role that Australia had taken in establishing the United Nations and getting it up and running in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since that very first meeting and very first General Assembly, Australia has taken a strong and active role in the United Nations in implementing our foreign policy principles, in our work and our dealings with countries around the world, and in the work that we have sought to have the United Nations achieve. But it is fair to say that the United Nations has reached its full potential only in the last four to five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was preparing to make my few comments on this Bill today, I asked the Parliamentary Library to give me some details about when the United Nations had previously utilised economic sanctions so that I could get a picture of how often we have done this and what need there would be in future. It was interesting to note that in its first 45 years the United Nations adopted measures to impose sanctions only twice, and those two instances were in relation to Rhodesia and South Africa. Of course, in South Africa a lot of those measures are still in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This partly reflected the reality of the world political situation at that time where we had fallen between two global entities which were competing with each other. Whenever the concept of sanctions came up, it usually involved one side's ally or the other side's ally. The United Nations Security Council was powerless to act because one of the countries in the Security Council whose ally was the subject of the possibility of sanctions would always veto that move. The Security Council virtually became a powerless instrument in enacting any real political pressure on countries that were perpetrating crimes against other neighbouring countries or against humanity in some form or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only where those global interests of either the East or the West were not being directly challenged that the United Nations was able to implement some form of sanctions. In many cases they were reasonably limited. Sanctions were imposed on Rhodesia by Security Council resolution 232 on 12 December 1966 and called on all member states to break economic relations with Rhodesia. Although those sanctions were imposed, it would be fair to say that a lot of countries within the world community and member states of the United Nations did not implement those sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note that at the time Rhodesian sanctions were implemented the Australian Government did not approve of the policy of imposing sanctions. The Liberal Government at that time and its Attorney-General, Mr Nigel Bowen, stated in 1966 that `very many Ministers found sanctions distasteful'&mdash;his party did not support the concept of economic sanctions&mdash;but that Australia would adhere to the sanctions once they had been formally adopted by the UN. It is important to note that although there were political differences about the concept of economic sanctions, Australian governments of both persuasions have implemented decisions of the United Nations&mdash;even though they might not necessarily have agreed with them&mdash;because they felt they were decisions of the international community and they should abide by them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second instance of the adoption of sanctions by the UN Security Council relates to South Africa. Resolution 418 of 4 November 1977 imposed an arms embargo on South Africa which is still in operation today. The Security Council determined that the acquisition of arms by South Africa constituted a `threat to the maintenance of international peace and security'. In 1977 the Australian Government and the Opposition fully supported those measures. After that there was quite a gap. Since that time there have been four further instances where decisions have been made by the Security Council to introduce economic sanctions. Firstly, sanctions were imposed on Iraq because of its invasion of Kuwait in 1990; secondly, resolution 748 of 15 April 1992 of the UN Security Council imposed an air and arms embargo against Libya because of the refusal by Libya to cooperate in the attempted trial of two men in relation to the bombing of a Pan American Airlines aircraft over Lockerbie in Scotland; thirdly, in Yugoslavia economic sanctions and arms embargoes have been imposed on various components of the former Yugoslavia in an attempt to bring about peace&mdash;unfortunately, that has still not succeeded, and most recently a hardening of those economic sanctions has been implemented; and, fourthly, sanctions were imposed on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge in an attempt to ensure that all parties to the dispute and the civil war in Cambodia abided by the United Nations peace agreement with Cambodia. At that time Australia again was a strong supporter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about the use of sanctions as a general principle, it has to be said that they are a very important instrument. If the United Nations Security Council has no power to impose trade sanctions or arms embargoes, then it is a toothless tiger. No matter how much chest beating and pontificating might occur in the General Assembly or the Security Council of the United Nations, if there is no weapon of a non-military nature to force countries to carry out the wishes of the international community, then we may as well not have a United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I support very strongly the reforms embodied in this legislation which will improve Australia's capacity to respond to decisions of the UN Security Council to impose sanctions. Sanctions are a weapon that the United Nations can use to force countries which are not abiding by international opinion, not observing the rule of international law, and not observing the rights of peoples to live in peace and freedom without being terrorised by their neighbouring states. If we do not have powers to implement that rule of law, then rogue nations will be able to get away with what they like and the international community will have very little means of controlling them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is very important is the fact that there needs to be a lot more consistency in the application of these economic sanctions. There are two other places on this earth where member nations of the United Nations have engaged in invasion, takeover and military suppression of other peoples, of neighbouring states, yet they have not been the subject of economic sanctions or arms embargoes by the United Nations Security Council. I believe most firmly that, if the United Nations is to maintain any form of credibility in the implementation of its work and in the use of economic sanctions, it has to impose them equally on all member countries which engage in those types of breaches of international law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning there was a private member's motion on East Timor. In that debate I made some comments about the actions of Indonesia and the fact that Indonesia perpetrated a military invasion on East Timor and took over that territory against the wishes of the people of East Timor. Since that time, it has imposed a reign of terror on the people of East Timor to maintain its military control over that territory. Yet there has not been one move in the United Nations to impose any form of economic sanctions against Indonesia. There have been some 12 resolutions of the UN General Assembly and of the UN Security Council telling Indonesia that it should get out of East Timor, that East Timor does not belong to it, and that it should stop its persecution and harassment of the people of East Timor. Yet there has been no effort by the UN Security Council to follow up those resolutions with any sort of firm action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat the call I made this morning on East Timor: it is now time for the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on Indonesia if it is not prepared to abide by the decisions of the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly. The people of East Timor do not wish to be part of Indonesia; they never have and they never will. They want the right of self-determination. The UN espouses the principle of self-determination as one of its founding principles and yet, in the case of East Timor, it is prepared to ignore it. Unfortunately, our country ignores that fundamental principle, which is a plank of our foreign policy and the foundation of all our dealings with other countries all around the world. But when it comes to countries in our near north, we allow them to get away with what they like. I think we face an unreasonable and unrealistic situation. It brings the UN into disrepute in that it is not prepared to implement fully the powers it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue which is often debated in this House is China's takeover of Tibet. In this instance a large superpower has taken over a small, defenceless country and it continues to persecute and rigidly control those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, China has not faced economic sanctions and arms embargos against its actions on the takeover of Tibet. The people of Tibet still suffer today under the hegemony of Chinese military rule in that country. So there are two instances which need addressing. If the United Nations with all its new power&mdash;with the new world order, which I do not believe exists; with this concept that is constantly being floated of a new world order&mdash;wants to maintain any sort of credibility around the world, it needs to start looking back on those other instances where it has failed to take action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Australian Government to raise these matters in the UN Security Council and in the UN General Assembly. If we do have any sort of commitment to the United Nations charter and the principles under which the United Nations was founded, we have a responsibility to act on those two places as well as all the other places where we have rightly sought involvement by the United Nations in places such as Cambodia, Iraq, Somalia and those other places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important Bill which strengthens Australia's capacity to respond to economic sanctions when they are decided. However, I urge the Australian Government to take up the challenge to also exercise its authority in the other areas around the world where the UN has failed to meet its true obligations to protect the interests of people who have been the subject of military takeover and invasion by larger countries. </PARA>

However, the Government and, I ought to say in fairness, the Opposition, particularly some of the older members who were here in about 1975, find it all so difficult. They do not want to offend our great northern trading partner, Indonesia, which&mdash;dare I suggest&mdash;could down the track somewhere be a military threat. We do not want to get on the wrong side of Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, as the honourable member for Moreton observes, we have done nothing. But he is now in the Government; so when he talks euphemistically about `our country's response', surely he needs to put pressure on the Australian government of the day to take Indonesia to task and go through the United Nations channels to ensure that its resolutions, as he rightly says, that have been moved in respect of East Timor are properly implemented. But, of course, as he mentions, they have not been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The  honourable member broadly canvassed the issues of economic sanctions, and that to a large extent is what the Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill is all about. The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) indicated the Opposition's total support for this legislation. But we must wonder how effective economic sanctions are, particularly in the short term. For instance, we saw economic sanctions imposed on South Africa for many years. The effectiveness of those sanctions on that particular country was always controversial and debatable. In the context of this Bill, the immediate trigger for this legislation is to allow a better response to United Nations resolutions. When talking about the United Nations response in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, we must also wonder how effective economic sanctions have been there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One must observe that those sanctions have been notoriously unsuccessful in preventing the mutual genocide in that country. We would all be aware of that, having seen so much over the past 12 months of what is actually happening in the former Yugoslavia. So I do not think that economic sanctions work effectively anywhere in the short term. Of course, those sanctions were not given a chance to work in Iraq because they were promptly followed up with a strong military response&mdash;at the time I am sure the absolutely correct response. That was certainly our position in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the immediate intention of the Bill is to allow for the full implementation of Australia's obligations under the United Nations Security Council resolution 820, which provides for the implementation of reinforced sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. I have taken quite an interest in the situation in the former Yugoslavia. I have now spoken in this Parliament on two or three occasions on that situation. In fact, I have a notice of motion today on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> in respect of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. </PARA>

<PARA>It goes on from there. Ironically, in so far as this legislation will help the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is almost obsolete at this point of time. It is almost all over for the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Western efforts, United Nations efforts, to halt Serbian aggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina have failed comprehensively. Worse now, it appears that territorial gains made through aggression by the Serbians in particular and, to some extent, the Croatians will actually now be legitimised. So much for the new world order. The honourable member for Moreton expressed his doubts about how effective it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw the world react to the invasion of Kuwait, but Kuwait had oil. There is no oil in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I have said it in this Parliament and I will say it again: six months ago the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and I were in Sarajevo and spoke with the legitimate Government of Bosnia. That Government made the point to us, `If we had oil here or something that was important to the Western world, the response would have been immediate and strong'. In respect of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the world has stood by and, once again, to use the description of the honourable member for Moreton, the United Nations has shown itself to be a toothless tiger. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to support the Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill, but I do so with some concern. I want to raise a few of what I see to be the problems. I am concerned that the central contradiction at the heart of this Bill is the conflict between supposed international legal obligations and the claim that we are free to disregard such obligations when they are deemed not to be in our own interests. A legal obligation means something that is binding by law and if breached is subject to some sort of sanction. If Australia was really legally obliged to act on resolutions of the UN Security Council or strictly according to United Nations conventions, then failure to do so would enact a legally enforceable penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government and others who continually cite our supposed international obligations want to have it both ways. On the one hand, they say that we are internationally obliged to act in a certain way as though there is no choice in the matter. On the other hand, they claim that we have the freedom to ignore these obligations when they are not deemed in our interest. The Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner), on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, said in his second reading speech that Australia, as a member of the United Nations, is required as a matter of international law by article 25 of the charter to implement the decisions of the UN Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading also states that, given the supposedly imperfect local mechanisms which exist to bring about Australian compliance with a Security Council resolution, this amendment is necessary. Without it we would find ourselves unable to meet our international obligations. With it we would have the speed and flexibility needed to comply. Once again this legislation turns upon the use of the Government's external affairs power. However, the second reading speech also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation will not have the effect of taking away from the Government or the Parliament the power to decide whether the imposition of sanctions against a particular foreign state is in Australia's national interests.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely, if Senator Evans places so much stress upon our international legal obligations, such an outlandish expression as national sovereignty would be a breach of those obligations, no matter what our reasons. By giving the supposedly international legal obligations such high status, how could we safely and independently express our national sovereignty in such instances? Surely the Government, by its constant harping about international obligations, by its constant use of the term as a sort of overriding moral authority, has placed this country in an invidious position and compromised our national sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were so bold as to refuse to comply with the United Nations Security Council resolution, the Security Council itself could accuse us of a flagrant breach of obligations our own Government has appealed to in the highest and most moralistic terms. So, by such continual appeals to international obligations, our own freedom to act as a sovereign nation in such matters is compromised. Also by a lap-dog willingness to follow a body dominated by the United States, we risk embroiling ourselves in overseas ventures against our better interests. We also, by tagging along with the UN whenever it decides to intervene in the affairs of sovereign nations, allow ourselves no defence should the UN ever decide to intervene in our own. There are more than enough internationalists in Australia virtually inviting foreign intervention already for our supposed breaches of international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine some of the UN interventions. The Gulf War intervention was led by the US for economic reasons. The Somali intervention was for supposedly humanitarian reasons, although US oil companies hold exploration rights to two-thirds of the country. The media got a lot of United Nations arranged photo opportunities in Somalia&mdash;but what happens once the troops leave? In spite of this, the disaster will unfold again. We have in the past got off lightly with our interventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what if the United Nations led Security Council should decide to send ground troops into a dispute involving heavy fighting? Do we follow them? Surely our international obligations, according to the constant moralistic use of the term by the Government, would demand it in spite of any reservations we might have to the contrary. The media would urge us to do so and would be the first to condemn us when the body bags started coming back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If our leadership was truly nationalistic, as it is claimed, it would be continually emphasising our national sovereignty; that we act in such and such a way because we have a right to do so and we as a nation insist upon it; that we intervene in the domestic affairs of a foreign country only with the utmost circumspection and not at the whim of other governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where we act in international accord with other nations we do so without in any way ceding our national sovereignty. We reserve the right to act according to our national interests, no matter what international documents we have signed or no matter what the Security Council has decreed. It may be that we most often find ourselves in agreement with the United Nations resolutions, but we must always make it firmly understood that we will not be intimidated by supposedly international legal obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is this bad for local morale; we supposedly have to follow where the bigger nations lead, as though we were hardly a nation at all&mdash;and that could lead to unforeseen circumstances. One day we may find ourselves at the end of such intervention, especially given the fact that so many supposed humanitarians and others seem to want that. No matter what the Government and others, for reasons of their own, might say, we are a sovereign nation. We have no obligation to either follow blindly the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council or to enact legislation based upon United Nations conventions, even where we have signed these conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the new Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) is likely to introduce racial vilification legislation in the spring session of the Parliament. This legislation is also justified in terms of our international obligation in supposedly meeting the requirements of the United Nations convention. These days Gough Whitlam is taking credit for laying the foundations of this legislation and, apparently, he cannot wait for it to be enacted. He claims that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has a mandate for the legislation. The first I heard about Gough saying all this was on a Melbourne radio program on April Fools' Day. How appropriate, for there is no fool like an old fool. He repeated all this recently. So Gough claims both a local mandate and an obligation under the United Nations convention as reasons why legislation should be passed. This is, of course, a double misrepresentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no obligation at all, internationally or otherwise, for Australia to pass such legislation. Even Lionel Murphy&mdash;a strong United Nations man&mdash;was not in favour of just transcribing a United Nations convention into local law. His own Bill of rights, which, as Attorney-General, he attempted unsuccessfully to have passed, was inspired by the United Nations covenant. Nevertheless, he found that the covenant, as it stood, would `greatly reduce the contents of the rights guaranteed by the articles'. These rights included free speech. In other words, where highly priced freedoms would be compromised by our adoption of a United Nations model, it was the United Nations model that would have to give way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, those comments were made by Lionel Murphy, who was strongly in favour of following the lead of United Nations agreements. He is not one of my favourites, but he clearly had a strong commitment to freedom of speech. It is unfortunate that those who regard him as an inspiration and who are so determined to have this Bill do not have a similar commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from all this, there is a great deal of misinformation and disinformation about what our international obligations really are. It is commonplace for internationalists, when it suits their purposes, to claim that we are in breach of international obligations. The Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, claimed on ABC television's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, and at other times, that Australia had breached its United Nations obligations in the processing of the Cambodian boat people. This was a blatant untruth, and Brian Burdekin, of course, knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission gains its moral legitimacy from a United Nations instrument, Mr Burdekin is obviously prepared to misrepresent the position of the United Nations when it suits him. It is not mentioned that lawyers representing the boat people were largely responsible for the delays in processing. In fact, the relevant United Nations authority is happy with Australia's processing of refugees. It is only people such as Burdekin, and people involved in the immigration industry and the churches, who make such claims. In other words, it is locals, often paid by the public of Australia, who misrepresent the position of the United Nations in order to put pressure on their own government by using the very rhetoric of the government. That is one clear example of how the Government's continual harping about `international obligations' can be used against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is done, of course, to exert pressure domestically, but by their actions those people continually invite international disapproval of their own country. In the past, church leaders in particular have made similar claims to those of Burdekin. The Catholic Archbishop of Perth, Bishop Hickey, has done so. The Anglican Archbishop of Perth, Dr Peter Carnley, in his 1992 Easter Day message, called the treatment of the refugee Cambodians `one of the most shameful events' in the history of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reporter actually bothered to seek a response from an appropriate United Nations representative to these claims. As reported in the 20 June edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, the head of the Bangkok office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees stated that Australia's record of processing asylum applications was well balanced, fair and deservedly reputable. I defy Brian Burdekin to get a UN refugee official to state that Australia is in breach of United Nations conditions in its treatment of refugees. If the ABC were doing its job, instead of acting as a propaganda unit, it would have inquired of the United Nations itself rather than taking the word of Brian Burdekin for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Anglican Archbishop of Adelaide, the Rev. Ian George, also claimed on 24 May at a BIR immigration conference that the message being sent to our neighbours about our treatment of asylum seekers is one portraying us as a selfish society. It infuriates me when people as privileged as he, bishop or not, accuse Australia of being selfish in immigration or refugee matters. Australia has one of the highest per capita intakes of refugees in the world and has been traditionally generous towards them. Now that it has decided to crack down on obvious refugee rorts, people such as the archbishop accuse Australia of being selfish. He claimed that our immigration policy was sending confusing messages to our neighbours. What rot! We are indeed sending confusing messages to our neighbours. Principally, they are that we&mdash;or, at least, our leaders&mdash;do not know who we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has constantly claimed that Australia is part of Asia but, after the Asians themselves ridiculed the idea, he backed off slightly and now claims that Australia is not an Asian country but a country in Asia. Increasingly, he will avoid saying that Australia is part of Asia and will say that it is a country in the Asia-Pacific region. No doubt, he will claim in the long run that that is what he has always said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our bishops and others want to play the good Samaritan as long as others bear the cost.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another person to use the international obligation argument is the well-known humanitarian, Hugh Morgan of Western Mining Corporation. He called for an immigration intake of 500,000 per annum, which&mdash;to quote from the July 1992 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Business Monthly</EMPHASIS> magazine&mdash;he said would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . satisfy growing international criticism that we have too much land for too few people. The alternative is damaging interference in our national affairs as increasingly interventionist bodies like the United Nations pressure Australia to increase its migrant intake, with the aim of creating a target population exceeding 100 million.</PARA>
<PARA>People such as Hugh Morgan, and his friends in the churches and human rights lobby, seem determined to provoke such a scenario. The pressure is coming from them, invoking a presently mythical standard of international obligation and international pressure which may very well become real, particularly if they continue to invite it. Morgan, the bishops and Burdekin all have one thing in common: a very comfortable lifestyle, in contrast with that of the bulk of ordinary Australians who bear the consequences and the cost of increased immigration and who want immigration cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the humanitarians and people like Morgan effectively promote open borders. Among other things, Morgan is president of the Australia-German Chamber of Commerce. He was at the same October meeting in Dusseldorf as German industrialist Dr Eckhard Rohkamm, who told the meeting, as reported on 28 October in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;no doubt at Hugh Morgan's prompting&mdash;that Australia needed to import cheap Asian labour. He told the conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia must be prepared to open up its borders and not live in splendid isolation.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to boast of how German industrialists were subcontracting work to surrounding central European nations, where wages are about 15 per cent of those in Germany&mdash;all this in spite of the high unemployment in Germany. He said that much lower wages were needed to make Australia an attractive place for investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extraordinary, is it not, how the multinational industrialists are as high-minded as the multiculturalist churches and human rights commissioners? It is extraordinary that their opinions coincide and that they use the same rhetoric. It is interesting to note that the New Zealand Foreign Minister has said that there cannot be free trade without free movement of labour, and that both our Prime Minister and New Zealand's Prime Minister Bolger see the Australia-New Zealand arrangement as a model to be extended into the Asian region to our north. This would virtually lead to open borders and would send local wages and working conditions through the floor. Is this part of Australia's international obligations to big business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the dictates of international economic interests are increasingly imposing themselves upon the sovereignty of nations. There was a very interesting article in the May edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Charter</EMPHASIS>, the journal of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia. The article, entitled `The world's biggest bank', encouraged Australian accountants and law firms to pursue opportunities as foreign consultants to the World Bank. Increasingly, the World Bank, which mainly lends to Third World countries, has been responsible for fundamental overhauls of the institutions of countries in order to make them safe for international investment. </PARA>
<PARA>The article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Charter</EMPHASIS> quoted Austrade's resident trade commissioner at the World Bank, Bruce Coyne, who acts as an agent for Australian firms seeking work with the bank. He states that, in order to get investments, countries such as Venezuela have handed over their judicial system for reform to the consultants of the World Bank. Coyne said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, the bank may be financing a transport project in the Philippines that involves development or restructuring of the local authority. This could lead to the bank bringing in accounting and management experts skilled in the transport sector, together with a legal expert to, for example, draw up new laws on tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA>After quoting Coyne, the author of the article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mountain-moving stuff, you might think, and you'd be right. It happens frequently when the World Bank is involved in a project: if local laws or procedures get in the way, change them.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what is stated, `If local laws or procedures get in the way, change them'. It does not occur to the writer of the article, who makes this statement with approval, that the interests and wishes of the citizens of the countries concerned may not coincide with the wishes of consultants to multinational investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement is made, however, that such projects are in the `national interest' of the countries involved. This is a concern to people of Third World countries whose conception of the national interest may be different from the economic elites of their own countries who borrow from the banks and gain by far the most, along with the banks and their agents, from the investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sort of international economic imperialism has implications for Australia as well. Quite apart from the danger of a decline to Third World status, it is clear that many in Australia's power elites embrace a destiny of laissez-faire economic internationalism, incorporating the breakdown of national sovereignty to better facilitate foreign investment. They are actively assisted by `humanitarian' internationalists. High immigration, the weakening of border controls and `free movement of labour' are part of the agenda. Many of these people stand to personally gain financially from such an agenda, at least in the short- to medium-term, but we will all lose out in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Though there has been a great deal of emphasis about the supposed quest for national independence through becoming a republic, our capacity for national independence has declined, not increased, in the last decade. True independence, as a number of more thoughtful commentators have pointed out, can be sustained only by a strong economy as well as national self-respect. Our present course will lead us to neither. While our debt continues to increase at such an alarming rate, we make ourselves more and more financially dependent upon foreign nations. At the same time our leaders cede our sovereignty to foreign bodies over which we have little control, as much as they may love to posture before them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The common thread in all of this is that we must act according to international obligations. Where is the national independence in that?

It is clear that on 26 April, following the failure of the UN Vance-Owen peace plan&mdash;which was rejected by the self-styled Bosnian-Serbian Parliament in Pala in Bosnia-Herzegovina&mdash;tough new United Nations sanctions came into force against the rump of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations Security Council, which passed the resolution on 17 April, had delayed its implementation to give the Bosnian-Serbs time to ratify the plan and to avoid jeopardising the chances of the Russian President, Mr Yeltsin, winning his recent referendum. As a consequence of this, we find ourselves today in the position of debating the Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill. I support the intent of the sanctions. I believe that it was necessary for the sanctions to be tightened. It was clear from the actions of the Bosnian-Serb Parliament after the eligible electors voted to reject the Vance-Owen peace plan that more stringent action was required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been considerably interested in the crisis that has affected the Balkans as a consequence of the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, and I want to see the quickest possible end to the enormous damage, bloodshed and loss of life that has been wreaked upon Bosnia-Herzegovina since the outbreak of hostilities. I refer particularly to the aggression perpetrated against the Muslims. On our television sets we have seen the bloodiness and the bitterness of the fighting in the epicentre of Bosnia-Herzegovina which revolves around the capital city of Sarejevo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In principle, I support the implementation of the sanctions against the rump of Yugoslavia, and the Serbian and Montenegran republics. Pressure must be placed on the transport of goods through Yugoslavia, its financial assets overseas must be frozen and shipping on the Danube and in the Adriatic must be blocked. Strict fines should be imposed on those organisations, individuals or nations that violate the particular sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Momcilo Krajifnak, the Speaker of the Bosnian-Serb Parliament said, `We must not hesitate to mobilise for the defence of the motherland, tighten our ranks and fight to the end'. Another member of the same parliament said, `If the Vietnamese can survive a war conducted by the Americans, we can too'. General Vlajic, the officer-in-charge of the Bosnian-Serb forces, indicated that there would be a campaign of terror conducted around the world if the rest of the world dared to try to implement more stringent actions, and in particular to deploy ground forces or air attacks designed to try to prevent the bitter fighting that has been going on for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a problem with this Bill, and that concerns the extent of the legislation and its consequences in relation to the powers of the States. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) indicated in the second reading speech in the Senate that the Bill was designed to provide for the States&mdash;in other words, that there would be overriding States legislation in achieving the implementation of sanctions. As a consequence of that, the Attorney-General of Western Australia, Cheryl Edwards, wrote to the Federal Attorney-General on 5 May indicating the concerns of the Western Australian Government. In her letter she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill has enormous scope, particularly in its potential to extend into areas of State concern and State law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the Bill proposes to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)bind the Crown in right of the States (proposed section 4);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)enable Commonwealth regulations to give effect to United Nations Security Council decisions including, for example, Security Council sanctions (proposed section 6);</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)enable such Commonwealth regulations&mdash;because of section 109 of the Commonwealth Constitution&mdash;to render subsequent inconsistent State laws or regulations invalid;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)allow Commonwealth (but not State) legislation passed after the commencement of this proposed Act (if it expressly so provides) to be interpreted as amending or repealing such Commonwealth regulations&mdash;clause 10.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is, only the Commonwealth&mdash;but not the States&mdash;will be able to amend, repeal or effect the operation of Commonwealth regulations implementing United Nations Security Council decisions. Therefore, there is an express and direct inconsistency between the positions under paragraphs (4) and (5); and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6)vest federal jurisdiction under this Bill in State Supreme Courts&mdash;proposed section 13(8)&mdash;which may well have important consequences in adding to the already very heavy work load of those courts.</PARA>
<PARA>As she indicated, the Bill also raises serious legal and constitutional issues concerning the extent of Commonwealth legislative power, in particular concerning the external affairs power under section 51 subsection 29 of the Constitution. The use of that power, particularly as contemplated by this Bill, has important and often detrimental political and legal consequences for Commonwealth-State relations. She concluded in her first letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the above matters, the timetable (of the Bill's introduction in the Senate next week) is far too short to enable appropriate and adequate consideration of the political consequences, merits and constitutional issues involved.</PARA>
<PARA>This is particularly so when the Commonwealth has provided no reasons for such urgency. The only suggestion is in paragraph 2 on page 2 of the facsimile from the Federal Attorney-General, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date, Australia has given effect to. . . sanctions [imposed by the United Nations Security Council] under existing legislation eg the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. However, the Security Council has in recent times begun to impose sanctions for which Australia has no legislative means to give effect.</PARA>
<PARA>The nub of this particular argument is, as the State Attorney-General, Mrs Edwards, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there is no supporting documentation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>or there was no supporting documentation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or reasons provided to suggest that factual premise correct.</PARA>
<PARA>She asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, has all State legislation been examined to ascertain whether it might be able to implement even some such sanctions?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if that paragraph two assertion is correct, it does not justify such an urgent unilateral Commonwealth legislative response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore that:</PARA>

<PARA>She asked that, because of the proposed timetable, she receive an early reply. The Attorney-General did reply on 18 May, to which Mrs Edwards replied subsequently on 24 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I mention the reply that Mrs Edwards made to the letter from the Federal Attorney-General, I might point out where some of those difficult Commonwealth-State political issues arise. Of course, we are in the process at the moment of a tremendous debate in the community, particularly in the media, as to the future of our Constitution and obviously the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally Western Australia always has been concerned about the extent to which Commonwealth legislation or the Commonwealth authority overlapped or overrode the State authority. There is considerable interest in Western Australia as to the extent of any proposed changes, so that there is going to be an opportunity for the Western Australian State Government and for other interested parties in Western Australia to be able to assert their case in a fundamental and forthright way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some suspicion, I might say, which is supported by some of the comments made by members on the other side of this chamber, that the real agenda for these proposed changes to our Constitution and the way in which we run our system of government is designed to eventually abolish the States. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner)&mdash;who was nominated by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as one of three members to prepare the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's speech&mdash;indicated earlier today in the members' 90-second statements and in his maiden speech that the abolition of the States was part of this process. At the time, there was quite rapturous acclaim from other members opposite&mdash;and I see a smile on the face of the sole member in the back bench  opposite me at the moment&mdash;for what I believe is a hidden agenda that will eventually see a movement towards the abolition of the States. I must say that, although it is probably a bit of a long bow to draw, there are some elements of this in the relationship of this Bill and its effects to State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention some of the matters raised in the letter from Mrs Edwards on 24 May to the Attorney-General. She said in relation to Security Council resolution 820 in the 1993 Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your facsimile states: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"The obligations under Resolution 820 were not able to be implemented in full under existing Commonwealth or State legislation.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>She asked the question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would you advise:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)  what obligations under that Resolution were able to be implemented under existing Commonwealth and/or State legislation; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)  what obligations could not be implemented under such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the scope of the 1993 Bill, she asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your facsimile indicates that the Bill was introduced to "fill the gap" in Commonwealth and State legislation in relation to Resolution 820.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, your facsimile also recognises that the Bill is intended to enable Commonwealth Regulations to implement future UN Security Council sanctions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your facsimile states: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"it was recognised [by the Commonwealth] that other Security Council sanctions might be imposed in the future which are not able to be given effect through existing legislation. The Bill therefore enables Regulations to be made to give effect to the obligations that arise in those circumstances</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is, a very considerable extension from the implementation of Resolution 820 to the implementation (by Commonwealth regulations) of all Security Council Resolutions.</PARA>
<PARA>She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your facsimiles do not suggest any justification for such an extension either in terms of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)  identifiable gaps in the existing Commonwealth and/or state legislation; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)  the inability of Commonwealth/State consultation to address the issue of the implementation of future Security Council Resolutions.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your facsimile of 18 May does, however, claim that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"the urgency with which Security Council obligations arise does not lend itself to detailed consultations with the States over their implementation."</EMPHASIS> I presume that this assertion is meant to apply to all future sanctions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She mentioned two matters which indicated the 1993 Bill ought not to extend as far as it is extending. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)there will be sanctions where urgency is not a prime or even important consideration; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)particularly in view of the new Security Council practice outlined in para 2 of your facsimile of 18 May 1993, the implementation of sanctions may need to be carefully considered on an individual basis, including the need for Commonwealth/State  consultation.</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, there are a number of issues raised by the later letter of the State Attorney-General, Mrs Edwards, in relation to the extent of the provisions of the Bill. I think that, under the circumstances, those issues need to be addressed and resolved as quickly as possible. As a Western Australian member, someone who is very keen to ensure that the authority and prerogative of the Western Australian State Parliament are not infringed unnecessarily or improperly by the Commonwealth, I am anxious to see that there is a proper consultation process between the Commonwealth and the State Government in relation to the Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill and, in particular, to ensure that there are no unnecessary infringements of the rights and the prerogative of the State Parliament and, of course, the State of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicated earlier that I do support the general principle of the Bill because I believe that the sanctions were necessary and there are some conceded foreseen difficulties&mdash;they are indicated in the correspondence of the Attorney-General and in the second reading speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;in relation to the implementation of the sanctions which are quite wide ranging in their effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In supporting the Bill, I would like to register my concerns about the issues raised by the Attorney-General of Western Australia and I would like to see those concerns addressed as quickly as possible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was indicated in the second reading speech of the Foreign Minister, it is clear that in the changes that have occurred in the international community&mdash;and, in particular, in the United Nations&mdash;since the breakup of the former Soviet Union, the opportunities for Security Council agreement to sanctions have improved considerably. As a consequence, a lot more resolutions of that sort have been introduced and thus it is necessary for Australia to fulfil its international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that Australia's membership of the United Nations and its participation in the implementation of sanctions is an important part of Australia's foreign obligations; there is no doubt about that at all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I support the Bill. I hope that resolution 820 and the sanctions imposed as a consequence have some salutary effect on aggression, and the opportunity to perpetrate aggression, against innocent civilians and others.

<PARA>The Bill will amend several laws including the income tax legislation and the Corporations Law.

Those measures included abolishing the existing priority of the Commissioner of Taxation for debts in relation to certain unremitted amounts which become payable after 30 June 1993.

The Bill will remove the commissioner's priority for debts in respect of those deductions, as well as certain other deductions such as those made from prescribed payments under the prescribed payments system. The amendments will apply to unremitted amounts which become payable after 30 June 1993.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the theme of the recent amendments to the Corporations Law, this measure will ensure solvency problems are confronted earlier and the escalation of debts will be prevented.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Insolvency (Tax Priorities) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 Bill seeks to give effect to the Government's announcement on 2 December last year to abolish the Australian Taxation Office's priority when an insolvency occurs. The announcement was made, as has already been pointed out, in a joint statement by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the then Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present arrangements the Australian Taxation Office has priority over employees and other unsecured creditors to claim unremitted group tax deductions and some other payments in the event of a company becoming insolvent. As the situation now stands these arrangements can cause considerable hardship for employees as a result of an insolvency because the ATO's priority means that there is often little or nothing left for employees and other creditors following the payment of these outstanding taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Bill sets out to remove the commissioner's priority for debts for those deductions including deductions made under the prescribed payments system. Under the proposed new arrangements debts due to the Commissioner of Taxation arising because of a failure to remit amounts deducted will be treated in a similar manner to debts payable to other unsecured creditors. This will put the Tax Office on an equal footing with other creditors, as might be expected. The amendments will apply only to unremitted amounts which become payable after 30 June 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Bill will remove the commissioner's priority in these matters, it will also facilitate the recovery of unremitted amounts by a new process of estimating those amounts which become payable after 30 June next. Recovery action may then be commenced on the basis of such an estimate. The estimate is to be made when the due date for the payment of the deductions has passed without deductions having been paid. However, opportunity will be given to allow those who have not remitted these deductions to inform the commissioner of the actual amount deducted, thereby obviating the need for the estimate process to come into play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Bill makes company directors liable for deductions made by the company and not subsequently remitted to the ATO. This measure is designed to allow a more efficient means by which reparations can be made for the amounts deducted but not remitted. It will force companies to confront their solvency problems more quickly and thereby prevent a rapid increase in their debts which might adversely affect their ability to make payment. Such a rapid increase in debts can easily occur because of the penalties imposed for late payment and the ATO's slowness in demanding payment of moneys that under the existing arrangements it is guaranteed to receive ahead of other creditors. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in his second reading speech indicated that the revenue effect will be neutral, whereas I am of the opinion that the penalty factors will mean that the commissioner may collect far less than he now collects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Under these new arrangements, a company will be forced to either make the payments due or go into voluntary administration or liquidation. Generally, directors will only become liable for unremitted amounts when one of those options is not taken by the taxpayer company. The commissioner will be required to notify directors who become liable to pay any unremitted amounts. However, liability is avoided if one of the options is exercised within 14 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of defences available to directors in recovery proceedings undertaken by the Commissioner of Taxation under the terms set out in the Bill. These provisions allow a director to establish that he did not take part in the company's management at the time the company failed to take one of the options to avoid liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these arrangements for the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Bill also makes a number of consequential amendments to the Corporations Law, the Bankruptcy Act and the Crown Debts (Priority) Act. The amendments to the Corporations Law contained in this Bill put the Commissioner of Taxation in the same position as other creditors, with the commissioner having access to the same remedies available to other creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The removal of the commissioner's priority, as proposed, brings these provisions into line with the new insolvency provisions in the Corporations Law that will begin operation in June of this year. The Bill thus brings the tax law into harmony with the new Corporations Law. The measures contained in the Bill have been in the pipeline for some five years now, it being that long ago that proposals along these lines were first recommended by the Law Reform Commission in its general insolvency inquiry in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Despite the long gestation period we are dealing with legislation in the now traditional mid-year rush, this Bill having only been tabled in the Senate on 19 May and dealt with in that place a few days later. As far as this House is concerned, the Bill has been introduced and is being debated within a day or so of it being debated and passed in its present form by the Senate. This is clearly an unsatisfactory state of affairs, particularly given some of the complex matters involved. The outcome of this rushed legislative process will be that the Bill will probably be passed without many of the coalition's concerns being satisfactorily addressed or explanations obtained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be pointed out that the coalition is not alone in having concerns about the rushed legislative process. The Law Council of Australia has written to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in a letter dated 24 May 1993 recommending that consideration of this legislation be deferred until such time as the Law Council can examine and comment on the Bill. This is an eminently reasonable request, coming from one of the peak law bodies in the country, and one which the Government would be expected to accede to; but apparently Labor does not care about the council's request or what it might have to say. It thinks it knows better than the Law Council of Australia in these matters and so we are debating the Bill today without knowing what that council thinks about the legislation. Of course, what we do know is that the council obviously has grave reservations; otherwise it would not be requesting that consideration of the Bill be deferred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this legislation falls into the now infamous pattern of legislating established by Labor in government. Important measures take years to get off the ground and be embodied in legislation. Yet, when proposals finally reach this place in the form of a Bill they are rushed through the Parliament in the mid-year or end of year rush and often debated under the guillotine. The result is that we get inferior legislation despite the enormous amount of time expended in putting the proposals and the legislation together in a way designed to meet the Government's own objectives. There is no excuse for legislation and for making law in this way. Yet, the Government does it time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these reservations, the objectives of this Bill are worthy and these measures are for the most part to be welcomed as useful improvements to the administration of tax law and corporate insolvency law. One of the many problems with the existing arrangements is that the size of the debts owed to the Tax Office is allowed to grow to ridiculous proportions because the Tax Office is so slow to recoup the money that is owed by the insolvent entity. The ATO now has no incentive to take quick and decisive action in these cases because its priority under the existing arrangements guarantees that it will get its money regardless of the consequences that might have for other creditors and, most importantly, employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the unpaid funds which are the subject of this Bill are not assets of the company, there is always the temptation for companies to make use of deductions on behalf of employees as emergency working capital which can be ultimately disastrous for the employees. There is also a problem with the existing arrangements and the new insolvency procedure of voluntary administration under the new corporations legislation. This procedure allows for the possibility that a company can trade out of its difficulties under the supervision of an administrator. But creditors will not agree to the use of this procedure if the only or principal beneficiary for such an arrangement is the Australian Taxation Office because of its priority under existing arrangements. Clearly, the ATO needs to be put on an equal footing with other creditors to permit some entities to trade out of difficulty and do so effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this Bill debts due to the commissioner as a result of failure to remit amounts deducted are treated on the same basis as debts payable to other unsecured creditors upon the entity being placed into insolvency administration by the rateable application of the insolvent estate's assets. The provisions dealing with the new recovery procedure based on the estimation of unremitted amounts gives rise to a number of concerns about the discretion that these provisions afford the Commissioner of Taxation. The Bill provides that the commissioner may have regard to anything that he thinks is relevant in making an estimate, a discretion similar to that afforded the commissioner in so many tax laws and the administration of those laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only restriction on the commissioner's discretion will be the requirement that the estimate be reasonable but, as we all know, that is a very loose restriction that affords little protection to the company or the entity concerned. Attempting to define what may be reasonable, and bringing the commissioner to account for his definition in any given case, is far more difficult than the word `reasonable' might be thought to imply. This is particularly so when it is realised that the Bill explicitly excludes the decisions of the commissioner from judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, effectively putting the commissioner's judgment in this matter and related matters above the law and increasing the onus of proof on companies and entities challenging the commissioner's estimate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no requirement in the proposed legislation that the estimate be based on an extrapolation of what reasonably would be due predicated upon past remittances of the particular taxpayer. The ability to pay the amount of the estimate which arises immediately upon the issuing of a notice is created by section 222AHA(1), with subsection 2 of the same section providing:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)  A liability to pay an estimate is separate and distinct from the liability to which the estimate relates.</PARA>
<PARA>However, payment of one liability will correspondingly reduce the other. If the amount paid to discharge the estimate exceeds the unpaid amount of the actual liability, then the commissioner must either refund the excess or apply it against any other liabilities that that entity might have. This last option may allow the commissioner to avoid having to seek to execute a judgment for a debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is accepted that the issuance of an assessment creates a liability, then this provision is of even wider benefit to the commissioner. Section 222AHC provides for an affidavit from the defendant if it attests to certain things that would constitute defence to recovery of the estimate. An estimate will be provable in a bankruptcy or a winding up. The penalty regime will operate if an estimate remains undischarged after seven days from the issuing of the notice. The penalties will be on the same terms as would apply to failure to pay the underlying liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioner is also given a wide discretion to make an agreement for the discharge of the liability by payments in instalments. The Bill provides that the relevant payments should be made or the company is immediately forced into liquidation or voluntary administration. As we should realise, these provisions are intended to prevent the use of PAYE money being used as emergency working capital. The directors become personally liable for the company's failure to pay if none of the three options of payment, voluntary administration or liquidation are taken up. These provisions are necessary to make the estimates procedure workable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A difficulty arises from the fact that these provisions also provide that any person who was a director at any time during the period from when liability to remit arose until the date when payment is due will be liable to pay the commissioner an amount equal to the unpaid amount of the company or entity's liability. This is despite the fact that the director may have resigned from the board, having failed to convince it to take one of the options required under this Bill. This individual could still be liable for the whole amount of the unpaid tax despite having attempted to do the right thing and having acted in good faith if the liability cannot effectively be applied to the other directors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the defences available to directors provide little effective protection in contingencies such as these. The defences themselves are under-specified, creating a great deal of uncertainty in the application of these provisions. For example, one available defence is for a director to show that he took all reasonable steps&mdash;there is that word again, `reasonable'&mdash;to ensure that the deductions were remitted or that there were no such steps that the director could take in the circumstances. Whether this section also protects a director who has acted in good faith is far from clear. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem with the Bill is its failure to address the ATO's duty under section 221Q of the Income Tax Assessment Act to credit an employee with an amount of tax equal to the amount deducted from that employee's salary or wages when the employer has made such deductions but has failed to issue a group certificate for the employee's salary or wages. The interaction of the new estimates procedure with section 221Q has not been dealt with and it is not clear whether the issue of an estimate will grant the benefit of the estimated amount due in tax to employees in the way that it should. This is potentially a very serious problem in that it is not clear exactly how one would go about bringing section 221Q into line with the new provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already indicated, the coalition supports the broad thrust of the legislation. The intentions behind the Bill are unobjectionable. They put the Australian Taxation Office on a more equal footing with other individuals, which is important for the rule of law in the administration of taxation law and corporate insolvency laws. The provisions of this Bill also seek to encourage companies to address their insolvency problems in a timely way and to facilitate the ATO's recovery of deductions made on behalf of employees. The Bill also affords these employees a greater measure of protection than is available under current arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, however, the coalition, both here and in the Senate, has brought the Government's attention to a number of apparent deficiencies in the legislation which may compromise its effectiveness. It is unfortunate that the Government's overly rushed approach to this legislative program means that these concerns will be left unaddressed, at least for the time being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have pointed out, the coalition parties are not the only ones with reservations about the specifics of the legislation. The Law Council of Australia has requested that consideration of this Bill be deferred until such time as it has had an opportunity to pass comment on the provisions. The Law Council obviously feels that it has not had enough time to scrutinise the legislation to its satisfaction, and any objective examination of the timing of this legislation through both Houses would bear testimony to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In debating this legislation this evening, rather than deferring its consideration as requested by the Law Council, the Government continues to show its disregard for sound law-making practices. If the peak law body in this country cannot persuade the Government to legislate in the correct manner, it would seem unlikely that the Opposition will ever be able to persuade it, given the Government's arrogance in this Parliament and its attitude towards debate and sensible discussion of measures such as this. It is a sad state of affairs that this Labor Government's most recent term of office is only a few months old and already it is back into its bad old arrogant habits. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the Opposition, this Government has a commitment to reform and to progressive reform. The Opposition has never seen fit to talk about the injustice of the current legislation or the previous legislation because it would not deliver justice to workers, through the delivery of their wages, and to small business. It has only ever been concerned with one particular side of the fence in taxation reform: it believes only in flat taxation, and it has always been quite happy to let the Commissioner of Taxation exercise his privilege against the wages of workers and the bills of small business people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot find, in doing my research into this matter, any comment from the Opposition on this matter over the previous decade or so. The pressure has come from this side of the House as well as from people in insolvency. It has not come from the Opposition, and that is the usual state of affairs when we look at taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get down to the main parts of the Bill. There are two in particular that I want to talk about today. The first one deals with the removal of the priority of the taxation commissioner in respect of bankrupt and insolvent businesses to collect unremitted PAYE and similar deductions made from the salaries or wages of the employees of businesses. It takes the priority of the commissioner away&mdash;that is a good thing&mdash;and it also sets up a mechanism to ensure that the taxation commissioner can collect PAYE taxation, in particular, promptly and fairly. As I said before, these changes rightly place the interests of workers and others at the head of the queue of unsecured creditors and ahead of the taxation commissioner. So essentially this Bill gives workers and others a better go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we should forget that what we are dealing with here is employees' taxes held in trust by the employers prior to their remittance to the Australian Taxation Office. Currently, if a firm becomes insolvent what net benefit is there to the community to give priority to the Tax Office while employees miss out on wages and other entitlements? Of course, the answer is that there is no justice in that arrangement, which is why this Bill is before the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point about this Bill is that employees of bankrupt or insolvent businesses will have much improved prospects of being paid their outstanding wages. For that reason alone, it is an historic reform&mdash;and should be acknowledged as such by the Opposition&mdash;and the Government should be congratulated by the Opposition for bringing this matter forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition cannot have it both ways. It cannot on the one hand argue that the principle is fine but that there should be more debate, because if the principle is fine one would have thought there was some urgency about putting this Bill into practice. Given the inequities that are taking place in the community, given the number of insolvencies which the Opposition constantly talks about, I would have thought that it would have seen some urgency in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is always the case, the Opposition does not care about the employees in particular who are left out in the cold by the current arrangement. This is legislation which has been called for by most sectors of the community, including the legal profession, but not called for by the Opposition. In fact, it is pretty hard to find many people who have a bad word to say about this legislation, except the Opposition. Let us say goodbye and good riddance to the old legislation and welcome the new legislation as a very substantial reforming achievement. It is simply a false economy to put the Commissioner of Taxation ahead of employees and other small businesses in terms of insolvency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of this legislation that I would like to deal with is the provision of a new method whereby the commissioner may receive unremitted amounts by estimating the amount due from a firm. The situation at the moment is that the taxation commissioner has no real way of estimating what a firm may owe the commissioner should it fall behind in its payments. This legislation provides a mechanism so that the Commissioner of Taxation can make an estimate of what is owed, and it provides a mechanism for the Commissioner of Taxation to commence recovery of that amount. That is a very welcome initiative because it will ensure that many of the problems that currently emerge will not get to the stage that they currently do and result in the insolvency of the firm. The terms and conditions of this mechanism are set out in proposed section 222AGA, and I do not intend to run through them at any length this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, I would like to talk about the other significant aspect of the Bill, which extends the liability for unremitted amounts to company directors. I concede this point: there is some cause for concern that if these sections were applied harshly there might be some disincentive for company directors to seek to continue to have their firm in operation whilst they were trying to sort out their problems. But I believe that there is sufficient scope within the Bill for company directors not to be concerned that they will be treated unduly harshly by the taxation commissioner. I believe that there are sufficient mechanisms within the Bill whereby company directors can ensure, through the Commissioner of Taxation&mdash;if they are acting properly and fairly and in the interests of their company and employees&mdash;that the taxation commissioner will take those considerations into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Bill provides that in a number of ways. Firstly, a director cannot be held liable under the new provisions unless he or she has received a written notice of failure to remit which points out the options that need to be taken by that company director. That is a very significant provision. Secondly, if the company is going through a short-term liquidity crisis, it is open to the company to enter into an arrangement with the Commissioner of Taxation. I believe that is a significant section of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the company is having major liquidity problems, the company can either enter into a scheme of voluntary administration or wind up voluntarily. Either way it means that the company does not continue, as is the case now, to accumulate huge debts to the Taxation Office, thereby prolonging and creating an even bigger problem for itself and for its employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In winding up, I would also like to make the comment that, given that this is such significant legislation that does change significantly the way tax law has operated, I believe it is incumbent upon the Taxation Office to spend some time and resources in educating the business community as to the effect of this new legislation. I do not believe at the moment the current legislation is well understood in the business community, but when we have a new initiative as significant as this one, which imposes significant obligations upon company directors, I believe it is important that the Taxation Office engage in that public education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ostensible object of this Insolvency (Tax Priorities) Legislation Amendment Bill is to remove priorities enjoyed by the Commissioner of Taxation in proving for certain debts and insolvencies of persons and companies in priority to other creditors. There are four types of debt involved. Firstly, there are tax instalment deductions made from salary or wages under the PAYE scheme; secondly, there are deductions made from prescribed payments under the prescribed payments scheme; then, of perhaps less day-to-day significance, certain natural resource and other unattributed income payments not remitted; and certain withholding tax payments not remitted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a long history to this. It goes back prior to 1978 when the Crown exercised a right of priority in proving in insolvencies, but it was a prerogative rather than a statutory right in the main. In 1978 the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs recommended the total abolition of all crown priority in its 1978 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Priority of crown debts</EMPHASIS>. This report was partially accepted when the extensive priority given to debts due to the Commonwealth was significantly diminished under the Crown Debts (Priority) Act 1981 of the Commonwealth. These were primarily directed at removing priority of personal tax debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as the Australian Law Reform Commission in its 1988 report mentioned, the priorities which relate to employers and other persons being required to collect tax money and remit it to the commissioner were largely left untouched. It is this second stage that we are now at. The Australian Law Reform Commission studied the subject of insolvency quite extensively and, in its report delivered in 1978, recommended that the commissioner's priority under sections 221P, 221YHJ, 221YHZD and 221YU of the Income Tax Assessment Act should be abolished. It is that recommendation which is in effect implemented by this 1993 Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very good reasons for the abolition of the priority which the Law Reform Commission articulated based on submissions to it. The commissioner's priority assures that he receives payment and consequently that he is under no pressure to recover unremitted taxes in the normal commercial manner. Secondly, by allowing taxation debts to accumulate without real risk to his position, the commissioner may seriously disadvantage other unsecured creditors. He may decide to let an employer continue trading even though group tax is owing, and other creditors who will not be privy to this information may be ultimately disadvantaged if the business later goes into liquidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the taxation debts of insolvents are insignificant in terms of total government receipts, but the amount forgone by a private creditor may be the difference between the creditor surviving or failing. If one wants to put that in terms of looking after workers, employees, and looking after small businessmen, we agree wholeheartedly with that proposition. The Opposition supports the principle of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am not going to address the merits or demerits of the further provisions in the Bill, but the manner in which they arrive at this House. Let me first mention what they are. The second part of the Bill introduces a procedure to facilitate recovery by the commissioner. Because the commissioner is not aware of circumstances within a company, he is enabled under the legislation to make an estimate of the liability. This is a detailed innovation about which there has been no consultation. I accept that in the joint press release of 2 December 1992 the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the then Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), both mentioned that there would be a range of measures brought forward in legislation. No detail of any sort was provided and none has been provided until this Bill was brought to the Senate last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One significant interested group, the Law Council of Australia, which has already been mentioned, reserves its opinion on those provisions because it has not had proper opportunity to study them, but it does suggest that it is undesirable that the process of recovery should be based on an estimate rather than on an inspection of the company books by the commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further amendments proposed in the Bill derogate directly from the basic principle under which the Government brings this Bill forward. The fact of the matter is that under the Bill it is proposed that the commissioner have significant advantages that other unsecured creditors would not have. We can see that much even in the explanatory memorandum. Page 45, `Background to the legislation', dealing with the Corporations Law, provides that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the Corporations Law are relatively minor and technical and support measures to be included in the Assessment Act. Broadly, they seek to put the Commissioner in the same position as other creditors, so the Commissioner has clear access to all the remedies enjoyed by other creditors.</PARA>
<PARA>If one believed that, there might be little to cavil at, but one need only turn four pages to page 49 where there is a subheading which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the liability of a director is avoided through a preference payment by the company, the position of Commissioner will be made equivalent to a guaranteed creditor</PARA>
<PARA>That is not putting the commissioner in the same position as any other unsecured creditor; it is giving him an advantage over unsecured creditors. The same reasons that make the basic principle supportable, put the commissioner in the same position as other unsecured creditors and do not give rise to an encouragement to an insolvent to continue trading, apply to that provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These proposals are all new. They seek to impose personal liabilities on directors in situations where other creditors are not entitled to a similar liability. The effect is, as is mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, that the commissioner is in effect a guaranteed creditor, and if he is a guaranteed creditor he has security. Instead of being an unsecured creditor he becomes a secured creditor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of very serious concern that this legislation, which had its genesis in 1978, had its actual initiation in 1988, and was foreshadowed in December 1992, should have been introduced precipitately in the Senate last week without any consultation with relevant interested groups. When we talk about corporate law reform, we talk about interested groups who number hundreds of thousands, if not millions. The daily activities of millions of people are affected by corporate law. Any amendment, however insignificant it might appear to those sitting in Canberra, affects people in every city and every suburban street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incumbent upon the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) to explain the urgency of this Bill. We accept that it affects small traders and employees. As suggested, the provisions under which the commissioner will in effect waive his priority can be brought into effect without introducing all the new paraphernalia that has been introduced along with it. The interested groups that are normally consulted on corporate law reform include: the Business Council of Australia, the Institute of Directors, the Law Council of Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Society of Certified Practising Accountants, and the Insolvency Practitioners Association. In this case none of them were consulted. Why not? Why the rush?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who even looks at this Bill can discern that it is very detailed. The explanatory memorandum requires very careful reading. This Bill gives the appearance of being Treasury driven. Will we see a trend in which things like competition policy and corporate law reform become the bailiwick of Treasury? Or will we continue with the previous very satisfactory arrangement under which there was wide consultation in the corporate community regarding corporate law reform? Surely we will not have a recovery in the Budget deficit linked to the personal liability of directors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But is the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) abandoning the consultation process that has worked so well in the past? Is the Attorney-General bowing to his more experienced Cabinet colleague the Treasurer in allowing this Bill, with its significant amendments, to be rushed through without consultation with the corporate community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council of Australia requested that the Bill be deferred to enable the council to study it. I received a letter today from the Business Council of Australia expressing support for the relevant provisions of the Bill so far as they absolve the commissioner's priorities for unremitted group tax. The council said, however, that it had concerns about other provisions of the Bill. It said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prime beneficiaries of this initiative are likely to be the former employees of those firms that face either bankruptcy or insolvency.

It is not only employees who stand to gain by the Government's actions in this Bill.

We are talking about money which at no stage was the employers' money. We are talking about funds which were gross wages for the employees from which the employer was required to make a deduction for remittance to the tax commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, employers faced with a liquidity problem have in some cases found the need or the desire to hold onto that money and not remit it to the Tax Office. Equally regrettably, it would appear that for some time the Tax Office has not been particularly efficient in its perusal, policing and collection of that money, although it does appear from some recent events in which I and the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) were involved in Brisbane that the Taxation Office has markedly improved its methods of collection and that we now have in place a system which quite speedily ensures follow-up where that group tax payment has not been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, employers who decide to solve their short-term liquidity problems by dipping into the employees' pockets, which is effectively what they do when they hold onto that group tax, should face the force of the law. It is not their money, never was, never will be and should not be held by them in that way. That payment is made by them on behalf of the employees out of the employees' income. It should be seen fairly and squarely in that light. In that light, it is appropriate to say to company directors, `You have a responsibility to ensure that those funds which you are transmitting but which are not your funds are passed onto the Commissioner of Taxation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some circumstances in which they would not be liable. A company director would not be liable where his or her company has obviously made its group tax payments to the commissioner or has been placed into voluntary liquidation. In those situations, the directors would not be liable. Where that is not so, the director may be held liable for the unremitted tax. That seems to me not to be unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides some measures to assist the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in recovering those outstanding amounts. It allows the tax commissioner to make an estimate of the amounts not remitted and to commence a recovery action on the basis of that estimate. This replaces the requirement for the tax commissioner to accurately assess the outstanding amounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new provisions give the tax commissioner a good deal more latitude. It is important in this debate to add that in exercising that new authority which the Bill confers the tax commissioner needs to ensure that the assessments are made carefully. The officers of the Australian Taxation Office, as with the great bulk of public servants, do an earnest job in the best interests of the nation and in accordance with the legislation within which they work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I think every honourable member in this place would have had enough representations from individuals who have had difficulties and, of late, employers who have failed to make group tax remittance payments. We would have had enough representations from those people to know that the Tax Office makes its fair share of mistakes as well. One of the things that concerns me is, while supporting this legislation, to ensure that the procedures within the Australian Taxation Office result in employers who are in all fairness and reasonableness undertaking the repayment of outstanding remittances being dealt with fairly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that has concerned me of late about remittances and the way in which the Tax Office has gone about collecting them is the transition. I spoke earlier about the fact that the Australian Taxation Office has not had a particularly effective record in collecting the group tax payments, which is why we now see group tax payments outstanding for two and three years. That should not be the case. It should not have occurred in the first place. It did occur for whatever reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have in place, though, a system in the Australian Taxation Office where those people who thought they were playing by the ground rules, even if they were not the legal rules, and had not remitted their payments for some time have had the full force of the law brought upon them. I think in those situations it is good public policy and good commonsense for the Australian Taxation Office to exercise some careful consideration when it looks at that transition so that it does not come down like a ton of bricks on top of those employers who are now quite genuinely endeavouring to make payments to make up for those payments which they have not previously made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that point because of the experience that I and other honourable members have had with group tax remittances and the way in which the ATO has dealt with them, particularly in view of the new authority which this Bill will afford to the tax commissioner: the opportunity that it presents to the tax commissioner to proceed on the basis of estimates rather than actual calculations of figures. That is an appropriate provision to ensure compliance. I simply put it to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Australian Taxation Office that they need to do that with some compassion and consideration, particularly in this period of transition where its own administrative procedures have now been far more effectively honed. I hope that the Treasurer and the Australian Taxation Office will take those matters on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I repeat my earlier comments in respect of the payments in toto. They are employees' wages. They should never have been used by employers for any purpose other than payment of tax. Those employers who did that were not only breaking the law but also breaking the confidence and trust that their employees had in them on those occasions where it has occurred. I will not pursue the issue any further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think anybody could disagree with the stated prime objective of the Insolvency (Tax Priorities) Legislation Amendment Bill, which is that the Commissioner of Taxation should get in the queue with other creditors when a bankruptcy occurs. The Commissioner of Taxation should not have a prior claim, and there would be few people in business who would not recognise the fact that the commissioner at times has, by initiating a claim, been to the fore in seeking to recover tax by creating a situation where a bankruptcy or liquidation has occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is necessarily the role of an agency of the Australian Government to be at the forefront in creating closures and losses of jobs in Australia. The commissioner will say from time to time, `We do not initiate these processes', but the commissioner can be very pressing and almost coercive in the way in which he applies pressure in order to recover taxes, whether it be unpaid tax, unremitted tax from PAYE, prescribed payment tax or any other tax that has not been paid. It may be company tax itself. Those with experience will recognise that the commissioner, once set on a course of action, is very hard to deny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House is considering the removal of the commissioner's priority and his claim to recover tax in the specific areas of pay-as-you-earn tax, prescribed payments tax, natural resource and other unattributed income payments and withholding tax. On those four basic heads of taxation owed to the commissioner where there is trouble with a company, the commissioner will have to get in the queue with everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a laudable objective, but I think that when considering laudable objectives it is necessary to get behind the screen and the statement first expressed by the Government and enunciated by members of the Government as a `win for workers'. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in a press release made on 19 May claims in the headline , `Workers rights are elevated'. I think few workers would recognise or know whether a company or an organisation had failed to make a payment of the deductions that had been made from wages and salaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner of Taxation, however, has got into the queue ahead of those with claims for the first payment of wages and salaries. In that way workers' rights have been denied, as have the rights of a whole range of other people&mdash;whether they be suppliers, people leasing property, landlords or others&mdash;who come together when there is difficulty in a company and make a decision about whether a settlement can be reached or whether a closure is warranted. The commissioner has said, `We will get in the queue with the rest and not claim a priority'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a laudable objective but concerns about its operation have been expressed by many notable lawyers and people familiar with the application of the Corporations Law Reform Bill and knowledgeable about the practice of insolvency in Australia. During the month of April the newspapers were filled with speculation about the provisions being considered under the Insolvency (Tax Priorities) Legislation Amendment Bill: are they fair; do they create more problems than they solve; should not the Government delay the introduction of the legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Government needs to approach the matter with care. Since there is so much uncertainty about the proposals, a period of consideration is warranted. The prime objective is stated up front, but I have doubts about other measures proposed in the Bill. The first relates to the estimation of unremitted amounts. For some time the commissioner has expressed concern for the fact that, in order to make a claim when an insolvency occurs, the commissioner must receive an accurate estimate of the amount of money to be withheld before a claim can be made. This legislation will allow the commissioner to estimate the amount of unremitted funds held by a company. Provided the commissioner is careful, most people would agree that that is a sensible approach; but the commissioner is not always careful and not always accurate. For example, the commissioner is not always careful towards the end of the financial year, when there is a requirement to make the deficit look good. The commissioner is not always careful about the needs of companies and individuals employed by private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan), in his second reading speech, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main objective of the new regime is to recover the actual deductions made. Ample opportunity will be provided to the person who did not remit the deductions, as required under the tax legislation, to inform the commissioner of the actual amount deducted.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a laudable commencing statement. However, we find that where wide discretion is allowed&mdash;and the tax commissioner is allowed wide discretion&mdash;the commissioner does not hesitate to change the rules. He will make a finding or determination that will suit the operation of the Tax Office but will not always necessarily be in the best interests of the Australian community. As has been mentioned by speakers on both sides of the House, the estimation of unremitted amounts is an area which needs to be approached with great caution. That alone is a reason for a more detailed examination of the precise section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area which seems to me to unwind the basic thrust of the Bill is the provision requiring directors to be responsible for unremitted amounts. The proposition is that when the commissioner cannot get at funds that he wants he can make an estimate. Then, if the company does not fulfil certain requirements within 14 days, the commissioner can go behind the company to the directors and demand from them payment within 14 days. The careless or unjudicial application of this provision, to my mind, completely overcomes or turns on its head the original proposition that the commissioner get in the queue with the rest. Pressure on directors to find funds will ensure that payment is made to the Tax Office first of all. In my view, this overturns the original proposition by putting pressure on individual directors to meet the payment of outstanding amounts from their personal funds, and it will mean that the commissioner has first chop anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the Minister to acknowledge that the pressure, stated or unstated, on directors to pay up overturns the proposition that the commissioner's priority in the queue has been removed. Certainly, there is pressure on directors to pay the Tax Office ahead of anybody else, and the proposed legislation would allow the commissioner, ahead of anybody else, to go to directors and require them either to pay up personally within 14 days or see that the company pays. That is an area which I would like to see drawn out and examined carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill contains defences for directors involved in recovery proceedings instituted by the commissioner. That is proper. If a director is sick, unaware or uninformed then there is a cop-out for the director. Many Australians believe that directors of Australian companies have at times been cavalier in their approach to their responsibilities, and I do not encourage that. However, I do believe that the extraordinary powers given to the taxation commissioner, in this instance, for the recovery of unremitted amounts, puts the commissioner back at the head of the queue. I believe that the commissioner already puts himself in that position completely and that this legislation will ensure that he continues to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conditions under which the commissioner can go to the directors are in themselves of interest. The commissioner can go to the directors if, within a period of 14 days after notice is given, the company has not done certain things. The company will stop the commissioner&mdash;or the process of the commissioner going to the directors will be stopped&mdash;in the following circumstances: if the liability for the unremitted amount has been discharged, meaning that the funds have been paid out; if an administrator has been appointed; or if the company is being wound up. Those are the three grounds upon which the commissioner may not go to the directors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the expiration of the 14 days notice given by the commissioner to the company, the directors are given 14 days notice of the penalty incurred and their requirement to remit the penalty. I think that is too short a time. It is only a 28-day period, involving notification of the company and notification of the director, before the commissioner moves in and recovers the funds. Meanwhile, the suppliers and other creditors are lined up waiting for their money, as they have always had to do. I do not see the change being brought into effect that was intended by the legislation. Although the intention seems to be to make the directors responsible&mdash;an intention with which I agree&mdash;there are shortcomings in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government and the Tax Office need to be careful in the application of the legislation. We have debated in the House many times, particularly before the election, the impact of the recession on private enterprise and its capacity to employ. In 1990 there were 8,500-odd bankruptcies; in 1991, 30,000; in 1992, over 16,800; to the end of the March quarter of the 1993 financial year, 11,123. The number of bankruptcies in Australia have skyrocketed, and that has been brought about by the recession. It is my view that care is needed&mdash;fairness but care. We do not want cavalier behaviour and we do not want the cowboys, but the Tax Office must be careful because not in every instance has it enjoyed a good reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by summarising the main thrust of the legislation, as I see it. Firstly, there is the proposal for the removal of the commissioner's priority, which is well-intentioned. Secondly, there is the proposal for the estimation of unremitted amounts, which is another reasonable proposition, particularly if the affairs of a company are confused and not properly known. But I am worried about the requirement to be placed on directors which could see the commissioner's willingness to forgo priority overturned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the last few days the Parliament has received the Auditor-General's report on the Australian Government. I am not saying that if the Government were a private undertaking it would be declared bankrupt, but statements by an auditor of this type would cause any company grave concern. We are talking about bankruptcy and the attitudes and financial good management of the Australian Government. Here we are legislating in regard to private enterprise when the Government itself needs to take note of statements from the Auditor-General such as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding decisions taken by the Government lack the benefit of the information that would normally be available in any well run company which manages the level and impact of its obligations on future cash flows, costs and investment decisions so as to protect its future viability and maximise its return to shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty serious statement from the Auditor-General. The Government should be careful when pontificating on the insolvency of others. The Government has to be careful that it is meeting all its obligations under proper management procedures. The Australian National Audit Office also has something to say about the management of Australian business&mdash;Australian Government Inc. One of the opening paragraphs says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO considers that the information currently provided is deficient to such an extent that the Parliament and the taxpayer is not in a position to assess the Government's management of its obligations and whether, in the management of programs, the Government has considered the impact on the level of obligations and the consequences to both existing and future taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a serious statement. If that were a prospectus, nobody would buy a single share in the Australian Government. If it were a statement before the tax commissioner, he would be starting to worry about whether there were some claims he should be making for unremitted funds against that company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government has been writing laws in a very fast fashion. The statement was produced on 2 December 1992&mdash;into the Senate, no discussion&mdash;and eminent lawyers saying, `We don't think you have got it right; we want to stop and look at this', and, bang, it is through, and it has not demonstrated its competency to run its own company, the great company of Australia. The directors of the Australian company, the Australian Government, have been caught short by its own Auditor-General's report which clearly states that it is not up to it and it has not done the job. The tax commissioner, the liquidator or the assessor ought to come in and look at the affairs of the directors to see how they are going and see how good they are at their job. For that matter, they might investigate the personal affairs of the directors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many hints that the Government is struggling to establish a proper framework and a proper Budget to help solve these problems. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has hinted that we are to have cuts in government expenditure, yet the head of Treasury has said, `We don't know whether we can make the necessary cuts'. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has said that the report of the Auditor-General is hardly worth the paper it is written on. He further says that the Government would keep its promise to provide tax cuts. Mr Willis says that the Government is going to do other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is all over the place on this issue. This is a bankruptcy Bill. The comments of the Auditor-General have been such that they would raise concern in any private company. I will not go into further details about what other people out in private enterprise have said about the management of the Australian Government, but I will reiterate my concern that this legislation appears to be overturning the details that the Government enunciated through the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) when he made his statement on 19 May. I think the Assistant Treasurer has overstated the benefit to the Australian community because he has not really assessed the commissioner's powers under this legislation. No-one else has been able to make a full assessment of what this legislation will mean. </PARA>

The announcement on 2 December last year allowed quite a bit of time for negotiations. I am sure all interested parties have had ample time to make their concerns known to government. Anybody who has been in Parliament for some time knows that people are fairly quick out of the box in getting their views known when they believe that there is a piece of legislation that may affect them.

The third concern was that the estimate should not be used to allow the commissioner to start proceedings to collect the tax. The simple fact is that without this procedure it can be dragged on. As we all know, the slippage in tax means that the tax is not paid on time, and that is a cost to the revenue. I believe the Government is fully justified in bringing forward this legislation today. In years to come we will look at the points made in this debate and we will see that many of the fears that have been raised were unfounded. </PARA>

The process by which the heads of jurisdiction are responsible for the administration of a court or tribunal is known as separate administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the commencement of separate administration it was agreed that the operations of the tribunal should be reviewed to assess the delivery of services by the tribunal and the effectiveness and efficiency of the tribunal's existing administrative operational arrangements and structures. The review was conducted by representatives of the tribunal, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Finance. Similar reviews were undertaken in the Federal Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review was deferred until the new president, the Hon. Justice O'Connor, had the opportunity of familiarising herself with the operations of the tribunal. Justice O'Connor was appointed as president in June 1990 following the death of the former president, the Hon. Mr Justice Hartigan. The review was undertaken between October 1990 and November 1991. The report of the review made some 200 recommendations for reform. Many of those recommendations related to the internal operation of the tribunal and have been implemented by the president of the tribunal. The review also made a number of recommendations for amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments are directed at streamlining the procedures of the tribunal and clarifying the powers of the tribunal in procedural matters. The amendments will enable the tribunal to operate more flexibly and will assist the tribunal to achieve maximum efficiency. The amendments to section 20 of the Act will provide a clearer statement of the president's role and functions in relation to the arrangement of business of the tribunal and will provide that the president may give directions as to the procedures to be followed generally in proceedings in the tribunal and in particular to enable directions that members shall sit at particular places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, subject to any provision to the contrary contained in an enactment conferring jurisdiction on the tribunal, the tribunal may be constituted in any one of the five ways as listed in section 21. Clause 6 will amend section 21 to provide for two additional combinations of members, three deputy presidents or two deputy presidents and a non-presidential member. This will give the president greater flexibility in constituting the tribunal in important or complex cases. Section 29 of the Act specifies the manner of applying for a review. Clause 9 will amend section 29 to provide for an address for service where an applicant has failed to provide an address for service in the application. This will ensure that the processing of such applications is not unduly delayed by uncertainty as to the appropriate address for service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the recent decision of the Federal Court in Angus Fire Armour Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (1988) 83 ALR 449 the court held that, on the proper construction of section 29, an application to the tribunal for a review of a decision is validly lodged notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to pay the application fee prescribed by the regulations. In these circumstances, although the application would be deemed to be validly lodged, there would be no obligation on the tribunal to process the application. Clause 10 will insert new  section 29A which provides that an application is not taken to be lodged unless the prescribed fee has been paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tribunal currently makes extensive use of directions hearings. Section 33 of the Act provides for the procedure to be followed by the tribunal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 34 of the Act provides for conferences to be held. The tribunal has developed the practice of convening preliminary conferences to determine the matters in issue prior to the hearing. As a significant proportion of cases are resolved at the preliminary conference this practice has proved an effective means of dealing with the workload of the tribunal. Clause 12 will amend section 34 by giving the president a discretion to determine whether or not a conference should be held. It will also amend subsection 34(1) by deleting the reference to consideration of the material lodged so that the president may direct the holding of a conference without doing so. These amendments should further enhance the use of preliminary conferences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsection 34(2) provides that where the parties reach an agreement at a preliminary conference, the tribunal must, subject to certain procedural requirements, make a decision in accordance with the terms of that agreement. The Bill inserts new section 42C which will replace subsection 34(2). This section gives the tribunal a discretion to decline to make a decision in terms of the agreement if it appears to the tribunal that it is appropriate to do so. This discretion is consistent with the role of the tribunal to review decisions on their merits and to substitute its decision for that of the decision maker. In making a decision the tribunal, in effect, stands in the shoes of the decision maker. It is inconsistent with the role of the tribunal to require it to make a decision adopting the terms of an agreement between the parties where it considers that, in the circumstances of the case, the agreement would not result in the correct or preferable decision being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 the tribunal began to consider the introduction of mediation as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism. A feasibility study recommended that participation should be voluntary, that mediation should be confidential, that cases should be selected on the basis of their suitability for mediation, that mediation should be conducted by suitably trained and accredited mediators and that there should be ongoing evaluation of the mediation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A pilot program was introduced in September 1991 and has been extensively evaluated. The result of the evaluation is that the tribunal has extended the scope of the program. Further extension of the program is expected following further evaluation. In mediation, a neutral third person assists the parties to arrive at their own solution to their dispute. The essence of mediation is that the parties are empowered to produce the result that is best suited to their own circumstances. In the tribunal, mediation provides an efficient and cost-effective method for the resolution of many disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government supports the availability of a greater choice of methods of dispute resolution and to this end has already provided the legislative framework for mediation and arbitration to be provided in the Federal Court and in the Family Court. The Courts (Mediation and Arbitration) Act 1991 amended the Family Law Act 1975 and the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to provide a framework for those courts to develop alternative forms of dispute resolution, in particular mediation and arbitration. The Act amended the Family Law Act and the Federal Court Act to allow those courts to refer suitable matters to mediation and arbitration and to make rules of court defining the procedure to be followed. This Bill provides a similar legislative framework to facilitate the use of mediation in the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tribunal actively encourages the use of mediation. However, it recognises that not all cases are suitable for mediation, such as those where the matter in dispute is of sufficient public importance for a decision to be made by the tribunal on the merits of the case, or where there is a degree of animosity between the parties which would inhibit the mediation process. The tribunal has developed procedures to ensure that only suitable matters are referred for mediation. Mediations are conducted only by members or staff who have been accredited as mediators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tribunal has made extensive use of the telephone for hearings, parts of hearings and for conferences. Clause 15 of the Bill will insert section 35A which expressly provides that the tribunal may allow a person to participate in proceedings by telephone, closed circuit television and any other means of communication. This provision will also allow persons to participate by means of video conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 18 of the Bill will amend section 42A to expand the tribunal's powers to dismiss applications. The new powers to dismiss matters include the power to dismiss matters for delay in pursuing the application, where there is not a reviewable decision, and for failure to appear at a directions hearing or mediation. Section 42A will also expressly provide where a matter has been dismissed the applicant may apply for a reinstatement. </PARA>

It seeks to implement some of the recommendations of a review of the operation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

The final report was provided in November 1991. As was also indicated, most of the recommendations, of which there are many, have apparently been implemented administratively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While some of the provisions of the Bill might be regarded as matters of procedural detail, it has to be remembered that unlike most courts and some other tribunals, the tribunal does not have rules of procedure separate from the Act which establishes it. All the procedure is dealt with in the Act itself. Of particular note in this Bill are the provisions dealing with alternative dispute resolution. Mediation is introduced to the tribunal's repertoire. It will be interesting to see to what extent this method of resolution is used and to what extent its use is successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In its 17 years the tribunal has broken many barriers.

He was involved in the creation of the tribunal and as Attorney-General from July 1977 to March 1983 was closely involved in its early years.

<PARA>It is reported in the AAT's annual report for 1991-92 that the AAT began to offer mediation as an alternative dispute resolution procedure within the AAT during 1991-92. A pilot mediation program was commenced in the social security and customs jurisdictions in Brisbane and Melbourne in September 1991 and in Sydney in March 1992. Following evaluation of the pilot program the AAT decided to adopt mediation as part of its pre-hearing process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that parties are not compelled to take part in mediation. Those participating in mediation are required to sign an agreement of confidentiality. Mediations are only conducted in the AAT by members and staff accredited as mediators. As at 30 June 1992 the AAT had held 64 mediations. Of the 55 mediations held in the social security jurisdiction, approximately 85 per cent resulted in a settlement agreement. Of the four mediations held in the customs jurisdiction, two were settled. Mediation currently occurs in conferences conducted under section 34 of the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Proposed new section 34A, which expressly authorises the AAT to use mediation will be inserted into the principal Act. Proposed subsection 34A(1) will allow the president, where it is thought desirable and the parties consent, to direct that a proceeding or any part of a proceeding or any matter arising out of a proceeding be referred to a mediator for mediation. Proposed subsection 34A(2) provides that a mediator is to be a member or officer of the AAT directed by the president to mediate in a particular case. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is a positive way to go. Frankly, in a number of jurisdictions it is the only way to go. Our society today is becoming more and more litigious and that litigation is becoming more and more expensive. Alternative dispute resolutions need to be explored by government and encouraged so that the log jams in our tribunals and courts can in some instances be removed or alleviated. As an example, community justice centres in New South Wales have proved very successful in resolving neighbourhood disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that, if the figures I have quoted this evening are carried through after this legislation is enacted, there will be considerable cost savings to the community. In addition, if it is deemed that the merits of a case could establish useful guidelines, that is not the sort of case that will be sent off to mediation; that will remain in the mainstream. But it is the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that we as a parliament need to address is giving people access to tribunals and courts. That is the big problem at the moment. One needs to be very, very rich or very, very poor. In New South Wales the Legal Aid Commission has now declined to grant legal aid in civil cases, irrespective of the merits. That cost cutting measure has been introduced by the Legal Aid Commission. It is a policy decision that I personally do not agree with, but it is one that members of the commission argue was their only alternative, because the legal aid dollar has not been matched at a State level because of other factors and priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My experience in the legal system in New South Wales is that alternative dispute resolution is the way to go with many neighbourhood disputes and local court matters. The same can be said of the AAT. It is pleasing that these amendments tonight do have opposition support. We are really talking about motherhood stuff and for that reason I will not keep the House much longer save to say that I applaud this aspect of the Bill. It is something that we as a parliament should look to more and more in other levels, tribunals and pieces of legislation. We need to remove people from this adversarial system that is being encouraged with every piece of legislation we introduce into this place and into the State courts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill which we support and commend gives legislative backing to a revised Murray-Darling Basin Agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia for the improved management of the land, water and environmental resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. It was originally introduced last year but, because of the election and so forth, it was not followed through in this place and it has now been reintroduced for debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background, the Murray-Darling Basin covers about one-seventh of Australia and produces about half of Australia's agricultural and forestry output. The area supports 25 per cent of Australia's cattle, a higher percentage of Australia's dairy production, about 50 per cent of its sheep, lambs and crops and almost 75 per cent of its irrigation land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach adopted and extended tonight has seen a genuinely holistic approach to the management of the basin's resources increasingly become a reality. That is important, because the production from this area is very substantial. It is about $10 billion a year and that needs to be seen in the context of very depressed commodity prices. The future in terms of potential production and value&mdash;which I will say a little more about later&mdash;is almost unlimited. We have both an economic and very strong cultural and environmental reasons for looking after this resource to the best of our ability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1914 the first River Murray waters agreement was signed and the River Murray Commission established. It divided and regulated the river flow between the three States and this was particularly important for South Australia as a State at the bottom end of the river system. In 1987 the River Murray waters agreement, which established a ministerial council and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, was signed by New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Commonwealth. Complementary legislation was passed shortly afterwards by the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministerial council was to provide effective planning and management for the equitable, efficient and sustainable use of the water, land and environmental resources of the basin, while the Murray-Darling Basin Commission was to assume regulatory responsibilities and to act as an advisory body to the ministerial council. To allow the people in the basin itself&mdash;and of course that involves many farming communities; the people at the coalface, so to speak&mdash;a greater say, a community advisory committee was established to provide a better communication link between the council and the people. Again, I think its work has, by and large, been commendable. I have had the good fortune to attend meetings held by that advisory committee. I can think of one in particular in Moree which all who attended would agree was of great value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Murray-Darling strategy aims to reduce the average salinity levels in the Murray River by 20 per cent and, at the same time, to drain and dispose of waste water on some 500,000 hectares of land affected by waterlogging and salinisation. Since 1988, more than $74 million has been jointly spent by governments on salt interception schemes and joint government and community based drainage and salinity management plans. Major interception works have been completed at Woolpunda and others started at Mallee Cliffs and other places. Drainage programs are under way in the Shepparton, Deniliquin and Murrumbidgee regions. Currently new strategies for irrigation management and water quality management are being developed, and I think it should be noted that there is no doubt that water quality is improving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us is a result of a review of the Murray-Darling Basin by the ministerial council. The most significant amendments to the agreement are the inclusion of the salinity and drainage strategy. This has been achieved by intergovernmental cooperation, which has now reached the point where it can be given legislative backing by all partners to the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amended agreement provides for water allocation through a system of continuous water accounting. This will allow New South Wales and Victoria to draw on their annual water allocation according to need. Unused allocations will be carried forward as credits and above allocation drawings will be carried forward as a debit against future entitlements. By allowing unused allocations to be carried forward, it removes the incentive for people to use irrigation water which perhaps they might not need at any given time. The Ministers involved believe this will facilitate the optimal use of a shared resource without disruption of fundamental access guarantees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also gives the commission more financial flexibility by allowing it, with council approval, to carry over limited funds from one year to the next. The legislation also empowers the ministerial council to modify the agreement through the approval of additional schedules to incorporate new strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following a successful passage of this Bill, the first schedule to be brought forward for approval will be one authorising the addition of Queensland. It is always desirable to lock in the Queenslanders if we can. Almost 25 per cent of the basin&mdash;a very substantial part of it&mdash;lies in Queensland, very productive country, and that includes the headwaters of the Darling River, which is the major tributary to the Murray River. Queensland's presence will ensure a whole-of-basin approach. </PARA>

The group wants greater emphasis on flood mitigation and land management in order to prevent land degradation, which it believes is caused by high regulated flows and flooding. It wants the Hume Dam to be filled not beyond 96 per cent of its capacity so that, if necessary, it could handle another four per cent which would lessen the impact of flooding. It would also like to see land-holders between the Hume Dam and Albury notified of the release of water, and the flood level at Albury to be reduced from 4.3 metres to 3.65 metres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The submission also calls for regulated flows to be kept at no more than 23,000 megalitres a day; the establishment of a body to advise the commission on total flood plain management; more research into shrubs and plants to protect river banks; and the prohibition of recreational boating and waterskiing in certain areas. The group says that if water management is improved, it will assist with Landcare management of the river banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the commission sympathises and agrees that flood mitigation works would assist this particular problem, it is a matter of cost. It is also a matter of undertaking works which might well have unforeseen implications for other irrigators. In short, it is not a straightforward matter. For example, the cost of the riverbank stability works would run into many millions of dollars and, in the view of the commission, the people in Deniliquin and on the Victorian side of the Murray might well suffer a reduction in their water supplies. I am told that this could mean that $20 million to $30 million worth of production would be lost in these areas, which is more than is lost through the current flooding in the Hume to Mulwala area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the answer is not simple, but I hope and trust that the commission will study this submission and undertake whatever practical steps it can to at least minimise the damage from flooding. For example, it seems to me that warnings of release could be made in accordance with the desires of the action group without any significant cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that this new agreement between the States and the Commonwealth allows the commission to take matters other than the quantity of water for farm irrigation into account, and many people hope to see an allocation of water for environmental purposes, particularly to the regular watering of the magnificent Murray River red gums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall objectives of improving water quality and managing the resources in the basin&mdash;this huge and very productive area of Australia&mdash;are, of course, totally desirable and we all support them. But I would like to touch very briefly on the problem created by the current very poor terms of trade and difficult circumstances&mdash;particularly relating at the moment to many people in the basin in seasonal terms&mdash;and the effect that this is having on the environment in the basin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entire length and breadth of the system sees environmentally conscious farmers&mdash;and the great bulk of Australian farmers today are only too conscious of the need to look after the resources they manage&mdash;who cannot do everything that they would like to do on their own farms in relation to water and soil conservation works and the like to address land and soil degradation. Land and soil degradation are surely our greatest peculiarly Australian problem&mdash;as opposed to the global environmental problems that we all face together. I am concerned that this lack of financial capability on the part of many farmers is holding back their desire, which we would want to support, to get on with certain environmentally wise actions they would like to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to hold out a bit of hope. It is my belief that the terms of trade problem that has so restricted farmers' incomes will, in the next couple of decades, in all likelihood turn around. We have had something like nine decades&mdash;or 90 years&mdash;of declining terms of trade for farmers when the real price of agricultural product, food and fibre has been dropping. But for a variety of reasons&mdash;some of them unhappy&mdash;that may be coming to an end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the rapidly expanding world population, given the increasing urban sprawl and its effect on the world's rich agricultural areas, given environmental restrictions on what can be produced and the quantities that can be produced in some agricultural parts of the world and, above all, given the rapidly expanding prosperity of the Asian nations to our immediate north, in my view it is quite likely that real agricultural prices will start to lift in the next few years. This is significant. Regardless of our political persuasion, we would all like to see farmers and farm communities benefit from increased returns in their current most unfortunate financial situation, but it does have environmental and major economic implications for the nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we look at the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, I think it is worth contemplating for a moment that we have two apparently conflicting needs: on the one hand, there is the economic imperative of ensuring that there is enough water to keep agricultural production up and in the future to take advantage of expanding opportunities and, on the other hand, there is the need to ensure that sufficient water is in the system to be able to ensure regular flushing of the river. That will not solve the blue-green algae problem or the salinity problem, but it may be a necessary and integral part of any long-term solutions to those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consideration of these quite weighty matters, on the surface, with some apparent in-built contradictions, has led to a considerable revival of interest in some parts of the State for a northern inland water transfer plan. This is not a new idea. It centres on the idea that we can build perhaps a junior version of the Snowy Mountains scheme and divert some water from the coastal river systems in the northern part of the State into either the border river system on the New South Wales-Queensland border or the Copeton Dam on the Gwydir River. The engineering aspect would represent a task of only a third of the size of the Snowy Mountains River scheme, as I understand it. At the moment the cost puts it out of economic range; it does not add up in terms of its potential for increasing production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point is that we are talking about a total transfer of perhaps 750,000 megalitres a year compared with the two million megalitres currently drawn from coastal rivers in the Snowy Mountains River scheme. I think the time may be ripe for a re-examination of this proposal for two reasons: firstly, the need for increased water in the Murray-Darling Basin for environmental reasons and, secondly, farmers terms of trade are changing and the pure economics, cost-benefit analysis, of such a construction project may very well change in the future. Nobody is suggesting that this might not have enormous implications for environmental matters and a great deal of study and research would need to be undertaken before anybody could take the proposal any further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention that tonight because we do have to grapple with our economic problems and with the likelihood that increased agricultural production, premium food exports into Asia and so forth, may well present us with opportunities we cannot afford to be without in the future. We need to examine all possible solutions on river flow in the inland system. We support the legislation and wish those involved all the best in seeking the best possible outcome for our Murray-Darling Basin. </PARA>

As the Deputy Leader of the National Party has said, I was part of the group which formulated the agreement between the three Labor governments and the Commonwealth, which we are amending tonight.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say a couple of things to the Deputy Leader of the National Party about the addition of Queensland in the agreement. I can assure the honourable member that for about four years we encouraged Queensland to become part of it. It feared that a cost would have to be borne by it. When I chaired the meeting in 1986 I was pleased to invite Queensland to participate as a delegate, which it did, and its interest has grown. It has finally realised that water pollution does not stop at a particular State's border&mdash;it is something that all States, in conjunction with the Commonwealth, have to take steps to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When mentioning farmers, I am concerned about the change of crops over the 90-odd years of settlement along the Murray and Darling rivers. Years ago cotton was not seen to be the basic crop that it is now. Cotton requires a regulated water flow. I remember very vividly visiting the irrigation areas but we did not see the growing of rice such as we have now. I know many rice growers do not agree with me, but I have always regarded rice as a weed in this country because we seem to percolate the ground for approximately 140 days a year and then we have problems overcoming salinity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In future we should have more consultation and government agreement. We should also go through an education process with our farmers in our environmentally suspect areas. Perhaps we will have to look at changing crops and the way in which those crops are fertilised and watered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill before the House will revise the Murray-Darling Basin agreement between the Commonwealth and three States: New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The history of joint government action to manage the great resource of the basin goes back to soon after Federation. The Commonwealth Government and the State governments in New South Wales&mdash;my home state&mdash;Victoria and South Australia first joined together in a non-legislatively based agreement in 1914. This was the first River Murray waters agreement and it established the River Murray Commission. The agreement principally encompassed a cooperative approach to the use of the water from the river for agricultural irrigation purposes. Finally, it was the subject of Commonwealth legislation in the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1983. The Bill before the House tonight will repeal the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The River Murray waters agreement faced a significant test in the 1980s as community concern regarding environmental issues facing the basin was brought to the foreground. The four governments&mdash;and I am pleased to say at that time they were all Labor administrations, which made it easier to consult and get agreement&mdash;strangely enough were all party to the original 1914 agreement. We took decisive action and entered into a new agreement to adopt a cooperative approach to the broader management issues&mdash;the management of the land, water and other environmental resources of the basin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That cooperative approach is a feature of our Labor governments and is consistent today with the approach that the Keating Government is now taking in addressing the issues facing our nation. There is no better evidence than in our Government's reform and restructure of our economy when we look at the consultation which has occurred with all sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Minister for Natural Resources in the Wran Labor Government in New South Wales I was privileged to take part in forging that wider agreement we are debating here tonight. This work culminated in an amended River Murray Waters Agreement in 1987 which led to enabling legislation in all parliaments at that time. The new agreement created a ministerial council and the River Murray Commission was replaced by the new Murray-Darling Basin Commission which was responsible to the ministerial council. I am pleased to say that this work laid the foundations for the impressive achievements to date in redressing environmental damage to the Murray-Darling Basin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill tonight annexes a fresh agreement regarding the Murray-Darling Basin. It sets out the natural resource management policy of the Commonwealth and the three State governments for Australia's most important agricultural region. It is a region which is vital to all Australians, producing approximately 50 per cent of Australia's output from natural resource based industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill reflects that the governments involved are taking serious action in meeting the challenges that our community faces regarding the Murray-Darling Basin. The region is facing the legacy of environmental degradation, including rising levels of salinity and other pollution which has culminated in the algal blooms of recent times. Reflecting this, the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts in its December 1992 discussion paper noted, `In 1991, algal blooms extended over 1,000 kilometres of the Darling River'. This, of course, resulted in the declaration of a state of emergency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern over the degradation of the basin as a whole led to our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) including major programs to address these problems as a critical part of his 1992 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Statement on the environment</EMPHASIS>. The statement reflects the real concern that our Labor Government demonstrates for the environment. It is a recognition of the international need for protection of the environment. I would like now by way of background to reflect on the environmental concerns of our Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very few of us would willingly reduce the standard of living that we enjoy. However, it is a sad fact that our lifestyle is underpinned by what is often claimed to be excessive use of our natural resources with which our nation abounds. One significant area where we pay a high price for our standard of living is through the pollution of our oceans and waterways. There has been no more disturbing example of this than witnessed in the widespread algal blooms experienced last summer. The Prime Minister recognised this in his 1992 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Statement on the environment</EMPHASIS>. In the statement he highlights that, for Australians living on an island continent, pollution of our waterways must be our prime concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protection of our environment is essential for a vast number of reasons. First and foremost, we have an obligation to preserve our environment for posterity, for our children and grandchildren. The quality of life which we enjoy is one which is based on enjoyment of the natural environment. One of the most defining features of our nation is that we have ready access to some of the most beautiful seas and waterways in the world. On a wider scale, we have an obligation to the world to ensure that we play a part in the international protection of this vast asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environment is also critical to our economic survival&mdash;for agriculture and for tourism. Agriculture is an extremely large employer and, despite the broadening of our economic base, rural exports still comprise 22 per cent of our exports. Protection of our natural environment is also critical to the ongoing growth of our tourism industry. It is no mistake that the major tourism campaigns for Australia provide a view of Australians and visitors enjoying themselves by the water; indeed, the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the harbour area have become one the world's best known attractions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Government has a proud record of achievement in the protection of our environment. In 1983, as one of the Labor Government's first decisions, it moved to protect Tasmania's Franklin River which was World Heritage listed. In 1984 the Kakadu National Park was doubled in size, protecting internationally significant waterways. Significant areas have been World Heritage listed to protect them for our grandchildren. These include: New South Wales rainforest areas, Uluru, the Queensland wet tropics, Kakadu National Park stage 2, Shark Bay in Western Australia, Fraser Island in Queensland and the Great Barrier Marine Park which made the reef the largest marine protected area in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Government has also taken a leading international role in protecting the environment through opposing mining in Antarctica. The international significance of this area can be gauged through realising that it and the seabed are the world's only two remaining frontiers. Also, I am proud to say, as a nation we participated in the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and all Australian governments adopted interim planning targets for greenhouse gas emission reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where this has been appropriate, our Government has ratified relevant conventions. Many have been ratified and one of particular concern in the context of this debate is the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter which was ratified in 1985. Protection of our rainforests has also been a major achievement of our Government. The rainforest program was established in 1986 as a comprehensive $22 million project. Importantly, tax deductions have also been made available for measures to address land degradation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year, the Prime Minister made his historic <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Statement on the environment</EMPHASIS>, to which I have referred a number of times tonight in this speech, which consolidates and builds on the progress we have already made. Its focus is on programs to combat the degradation of our land and our waterways. It commits a massive investment of $426 million to rehabilitate huge tracts of land. A key element in the statement is a major effort to reclaim the Murray-Darling river system which we now know is in a state of degradation. The Prime Minister in his statement outlines how this degradation has cost the nation dearly in money terms and poisoned vast areas of formerly productive land. The action that will be taken as a result of the passage of this Murray-Darling Basin Bill will be a key step in dealing with these challenges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters set forward in the Bill reflect that the Government is serious in encouraging community wide involvement and change which will continue to result in better management for the basin. There are several features of the Bill which I wish to particularly mention and applaud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revised agreement will bring into legislation the salinity and drainage strategy. It recognises that the proper management of these issues is vital to the productive future of agriculture in our nation. There have already been impressive achievements in redressing salinity and drainage through the salinity and drainage strategy, which is a key element of the natural resources management strategy of the current agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over $74 million of joint government funding has been expended on schemes to manage and reduce salinity levels in the river. There has been major progress towards the goal to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in river salinity. The governments involved have recognised that the development of this strategy has advanced to the point which enables it now to be formally included with the authority of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passing of the Bill will also give another significant outcome. Queensland, in which over one-quarter of the basin is situated&mdash;including the headwaters of the Darling River&mdash;will be authorised to accede to the Murray-Darling Basin initiative. Following passage of the Bill, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has indicated that the first schedule to be brought forward will authorise this accession. In a 13 May 1993 press release the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, the Hon. Edmund Casey MLA, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Goss Government recognises that major catchment areas cannot be managed in isolation from other States. The former National Party Government refused to recognise this and would not join any basin agreement for decades.</PARA>
<PARA>How true those words were. The Bill also allows a more flexible approach to the management of water resources through a system of continuous water accounting. It provides that the signatories to the agreement will be able to draw upon their set water allocation on a flexible basis; to draw more or less than their current entitlement&mdash;if circumstances require. Such increase or decrease in allowance will be carried forward to future accounting periods. This flexibility&mdash;under controlled circumstances&mdash;cuts through the red tape which could have had undesirable consequences for the major agricultural users who depend upon the waters of the basin. In this way this amendment permits governments to deal with the fluctuating demands of agriculture while protecting our environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is one that I commend to the House. The Government has a proud record in protection of the environment in Australia and this Bill will ensure that Australia can continue to uphold its international reputation in the forefront of nations regarding this important work for our nation's heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the National Party commented on what we should be doing with our waters and how we should be diverting them. I have a tremendous worry about that. I believe it is possible through engineering to solve these problems.

Perhaps one day there will be a solution to overcome that so we do not see continual waste during floods when we do not have adequate storages. In times of drought we would feel that we should have really better preserved that water.

This will allow these vehicles to compete against other vehicles, mostly imports, which currently qualify for these allowances. By way of explanation, to illustrate, one of the vehicles involved is the Ford Longreach.

If tax has been paid on the containers at the time of purchase and the value of the containers has been included in the taxable value of the contents, a credit for the tax paid on the purchase of the containers will be available to avoid double taxation of the containers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) for his earlier information. I am sure that he understood that we were operating in a bit of a vacuum. With respect to the sales tax on containers, I see that the Government, albeit in a very limited way, has picked up the coalition's GST principles, which attracted so much controversy, and will allow tax on a container of finished product&mdash;presumably, manufactured or processed food&mdash;to be credited in exactly the same way as it would have if the GST operated. I mention that only by way of general comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition supports the amendment, and that is one reason why we did not object too much to the earlier motion and saw no reason, given the absence of earlier advice, to question what the Speaker had to say on the matter. We are in his and the Government's hands on that matter, and I want the committee to understand that we in no way endorse the procedure that we are about to adopt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, as I have already indicated, we accept the amendment as it has been outlined by the Assistant Treasurer. Indeed, the amendment was one of those which generated from the Senate, largely but not entirely on the initiative of the coalition. The fact that it has been brought into effect, albeit perhaps with some imperfection, is a tribute to the way the committee system works in that place. Indeed, a Senate committee took the time and trouble&mdash;something not taken by any committee of this chamber&mdash;to look at the proposals in total and to point out to the Government where the original Bill was deficient. Consequently, the amendments were agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am still not quite clear about the matter, it is my understanding that certain taxpayers may elect to pay sales tax at the time the containers, which are ultimately used and which include food for sale, are purchased. My first impression&mdash;and this is what led to my difficulty in understanding what the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was getting at&mdash;was that we were really only substituting the time at which taxation was paid rather than the amount of it. On the face of it, and from the information I have been given, that would still seem to be the case. The Assistant Treasurer is shaking his head. I will accept his assurance but I must say that I was relying on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of the Senate debate when I arrived at that apparently incorrect conclusion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have an opportunity to participate in the debate on the Murray-Darling Basin Bill. I am particularly pleased because I referred to this Bill and to the basin in my maiden speech in this House 10 years ago. As one who has had a lifelong involvement in the Murray-Darling Basin, I have a particular interest in any legislation that comes before the House which has an impact on the basin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All speakers in this debate have focused on the enormity of the basin and the impact it makes on the economic viability of our nation. In his second reading speech the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), as did subsequent speakers, referred to the fact that 75 per cent of Australia's irrigated land is caught up in the Murray-Darling Basin. Twenty-five per cent of our cattle and dairy herds are also contained within that basin. It is the predominant horticultural area in Australia and, as other speakers have said, it generates in excess of $10 billion annually for Australia. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me take that one step further. To keep the whole debate in perspective, and to let Australians appreciate just how important this basin is, we need to be aware that not only is it one-seventh of the area of Australia&mdash;I know that the electorate of Maranoa is a large one but even it is not one-seventh of Australia&mdash;but it is as large as the Republic of South Africa and six times the size of New Zealand. So the importance of the basin and the importance of the legislation before the House cannot be overstated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basin has been characterised by its dependence on its rivers, particularly the Murray and Darling rivers. We are all aware of the impact that development of the basin has had on our environment, a point that was made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). Most honourable members know that, as a result of the Murray-Darling Basin having once been part of an enormous inland sea, no matter what the people of the 20th century do by way of development in this basin there will be an ongoing salinity problem. If there were no irrigation at all in the Murray-Darling Basin, and if there had been no European development, there would still be an enormous salinity problem as the remnant of what was once an inland sea makes its way via the Murray and Darling rivers to the ocean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that the Murray and Darling rivers carry 1.4 million tonnes of salt to the sea every year. If someone sat at a property on the border between New South Wales and South Australia and watched the Murray River flowing past, that person would be watching the equivalent of a semitrailer load of salt go by every 12 minutes. That sounds unbelievable. I suppose that it is a figure that applies when the river is at its most saline, but the point that needs to be made to keep this debate in perspective is that the salt load exists, not because of irrigation development and not because of European settlement, but because the area was once a vast inland sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to some of the implications made by the honourable member for Prospect, there has been a bipartisan effort to address the problems of the basin. Over two decades successive governments have recognised the importance of pouring money into rehabilitation in the Murray-Darling Basin scheme. Whether it was the Fraser Government, the Hawke Government, or the Keating Government, there has been a commitment to do something about the salinity of the Murray-Darling Basin. This salinity occurs both naturally and as a result of European settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to take a negative view of the basin. We have all seen those classic television documentaries showing dying red gums and vast areas of dry land salinity highlighting the problems that have occurred in drainage areas as a result of flood irrigation and, in recent times, making so much of blue-green algae infestations. They have left us with the impression that the Murray-Darling Basin was some sort of disaster area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in reality it is rather an idyllic place to live, with salinity levels largely under control&mdash;thanks to the joint efforts of governments over the last two decades. A point I want to make, which I think was overlooked by the honourable member for Prospect&mdash;I do not say that critically&mdash;is that it is not a matter of the way we may manipulate rivers in the future or choose to make water flow inland. The reality is that the River Murray&mdash;and to a lesser extent the Darling River&mdash;has already been manipulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a continent like Australia rivers normally have a high flow in the wintertime and a low flow in the summertime, and that was characteristic of the Murray. As a result of astonishing engineering efforts, and as a result of people's enthusiasm for development, we now have a Murray River that has a discouraged flow in the wintertime through locks and an encouraged flow in the summertime. The vast lagoons and billabongs of the Murray that once filled up in winter and emptied out in summer now remain as enormous lakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether we like it or not, in order to sustain the  lifestyle we have and in order to generate $10 billion worth of exports annually, we have created an environment in which the Murray and the Darling, rather than being perpetually flowing streams that have high rivers in periods of high rainfall and low rivers in periods of low rainfall, are now a series of lakes locked in place by the weirs and locks that cross them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the environment has changed. It may not have changed for the better in ecological terms, but change is inevitable. We all depend on the changes that have occurred. Horticulturalists depend upon them in order to have a reliable supply of irrigation water. Cities in the eastern States and in my State of South Australia are totally dependent on this water source. If it were not for the series of lakes that we now call the Murray-Darling Basin, there would be no development in the iron triangle cities of South Australia, and very little development in the city of Adelaide. People from South Australia and the eastern states depend upon the river for recreation, and rely on the fact that it will always have an adequate flow not only for recreational purposes but also to sustain the lifestyle that we now take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This area was once a huge inland sea and there is still this huge salt load in the catchment area of the Murray-Darling Basin. This salt load is endeavouring to make its way to the sea and is being caught in this system known as the Murray-Darling Basin which we have now successfully locked into a series of lakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To their credit, this Government and previous governments have gone out and identified where these natural highly saline inflows exist and intercepted them with pumps and bores which have picked up the highly saline inflow. I am familiar with the Wilpunda and Waikerie areas. The Wilpunda scheme has 24 interceptor bores already completed, discharging saline water into an evaporation basin deliberately set well back from the river in a relatively impervious clay area in order to minimise the natural saline inflows that occur in the Murray-Darling system. This has involved an investment of $74 million in salt interception in order to meet the target jointly recognised as ideal by all governments&mdash;reducing salinity in the Murray-Darling Basin by about 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the interception of the natural saline flows, other initiatives have contributed to the environment of the Murray-Darling Basin. Irrigators are now much more selective in the irrigation techniques that they apply. The widespread use of flood irrigation that provided all sorts of inherent drainage problems has been replaced by overhead sprinkler irrigation, microjet irrigation where a small sprinkler is apportioned at low level to each tree or vine, or dripper irrigation which allows an even more accurate use of water. The more accurately the water is apportioned to each plant the less the drainage build-up and the greater the opportunity to keep this water from flowing back into the river and picking up salts on its journey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the role of governments, both State and federal, and of irrigators in endeavouring to do something about the state of the Murray-Darling Basin. Only last week I visited Renmark with Senator Sherry who is conducting an inquiry into the citrus industry. At Yandilla Park the growers have deliberately chosen not to plant some areas that would automatically have been planted as recently as a decade ago. They are providing an even soil type and irrigating the plants only with sufficient water for their needs, thus minimising potential drainage run-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of the Murray-Darling Basin Bill is that it provides for a revised agreement on the way in which the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia go about the management of the Murray-Darling Basin. For the first time it includes legislative recognition of salinity and drainage strategies deliberately designed to improve the environment of the Murray-Darling Basin. In addition, for the first time the States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia will have continuous water accounting so that a State that uses less than its allocation of water can claim a credit, and it can use up that credit in a dry year when more water is needed&mdash;presuming more water is available without robbing other States of their allocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system of deliberate water accounting is a credit to the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), a former premier of South Australia. He put his political career on the line in order to initiate the present negotiations between the States that allowed the States to recognise that the River Murray particularly, and the Murray-Darling area in total, was an area that could not go on sustaining the development that was being demanded of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well recall the debate that ran so furiously in South Australia over the future of the Dartmouth Dam and the provision of sufficient water, and I recall the honourable member for Boothby's determination that South Australia should have a guaranteed allocation of water. It is to the credit of the honourable member for Boothby and my State that the government of the day was prepared to legislate to ensure that South Australia got its allocation of water. It is somewhat to the discredit of the New South Wales and Victorian governments of the day that they were not prepared to take similar steps, and so now in some seasons and in some instances they find themselves making a greater demand on the Murray-Darling Basin than it is able to meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Government and I endorse the changes that are currently before the House for continuous water accounting, but I would put this codicil in: as a South Australian, I want assurances from the Government that my State will not ever be denied its allocation of water&mdash;I guess that is fairly obvious and the Government would say, `No, that won't happen'&mdash;and that my State will have the opportunity to continue the practice of having from time to time the sort of high river that allows South Australian irrigators to flush out some of the lagoons and backwaters with a flushing flow that carries what would be a saline build-up in those lagoons and backwaters out to the sea, so minimising the total salt load being borne by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important result of these legislative changes will be the opportunity for Queensland to be included in the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. I do not want particularly to focus on the comments of the honourable member for Prospect, but she was just a shade critical of the former National Party government in Queensland for its reluctance to participate in the Murray-Darling Basin area. I think that was a little unfair. It is this legislation that allows Queenslanders to participate. It is this legislation that gives teeth to what we would want the Queenslanders to do: that is, give them a legislative platform on which to become involved totally and legislatively in the Murray-Darling Basin area and ensure that the Queensland Government&mdash;in this case, the Goss Government&mdash;passes legislation that will be complementary to the legislation passed in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, thus encouraging four-State management of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On my way to Canberra this week I visited Albury to see some of the work being done in the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre. For all that has been negative in this debate and for all of the concern that has been expressed about such things as blue-green algae, at the Murray-Darling research centre in Albury, in the electorate of the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), I saw some very encouraging work being done on the control of blue-green algae. I pay tribute to the director of the centre, Dr David Mitchell, and to all of his staff, but particularly Dr Terry Hillman and Dr Rod Oliver, whose work I found particularly interesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to two particular areas of research currently being undertaken by the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre. The first is the work being done in monitoring the outflows of the newsprint mills at Albury. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), who is to follow me in this debate, will be very familiar with this matter and the concern that has been expressed about the development of the newsprint mill. As a result of the consultancy work being done by the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre, there is now an opportunity to monitor the river both above and below the mill. I am pleased to report that at this time the mill outflows are not causing any traceable impact on the Murray-Darling Basin environment. I think that is very much to the credit of the mill management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other encouraging work I discovered at the centre was that being done in blue-green algae control. Here it is worth noting that the centre has been collecting the zooplankton from the base of the river, identifying it and putting it into various species so that, for the first time, we have a list of what sort of species make up the Murray River environment in the Albury area. </PARA>

The centre has responded by endeavouring to do as much consultancy work as possible, but what is needed more than anything is an opportunity for the centre to expand into the mid-Murray area, into the Mildura or Loxton area, and to allow some sort of supervision of blue-green algae growth below the Darling to occur as well as the current investigative work being carried out above the Darling.</PARA></TALK.START>

But it was not all that easy, because I have some correspondence from the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Ed Casey, who was reflecting on some negotiations he had had about Queensland joining the agreement, and in a letter of 23 June 1992, of which I have a copy: he noted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community feedback from the workshops was clearly of the opinion that Queensland should not join the initiative mainly because they perceived it as a threat to Queensland development potential.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there was still significant community opinion that Queensland should not become a member of this agreement, which is now a three-State-with-us-added agreement plus the Commonwealth. It is more by way of saying it took a Labor government a couple of years to work through some of the issues that surrounded the question of Queensland finally joining in with the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and the marvellous work that it does. But there was significant community resistance. It was a disgrace that the previous National Party government of 30 years had refused in all those years to ignore State boundaries and understand the importance of the management of total water catchment areas and that we cannot just regard State boundaries as being of no consequence whatsoever. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us stick to the Murray-Darling because that is the one that concerns me most. I remember talking to Ed Casey when he first came to power in 1989. His public servants from the Department of Primary Industries approached him and said, `Minister, are we now allowed to telephone our Commonwealth public servants and talk to them about these matters?'. Under the Bjelke-Petersen Government, Queensland public servants were forbidden to talk to Commonwealth public servants about these matters. That was the sort of paranoia under which we lived in those days. So we had to change not only a culture of relationships between the Commonwealth and the State, and change the community recognition of the importance of Queensland's joining in with the commission, but also we had to determine for ourselves the importance of joining in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland, for its part, has promised to pay, I think, $150,000 a year into the funding of the commission. In return, Queensland can now play a part in the various programs and in the management of the entire basin and system; it means that it will be eligible for federal funding which, no doubt, played a big part in Queensland's entry into the entire scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to give some background to Queensland's delay in joining, and to outline the work that has taken place since it joined because it does affect a group that I am closely associated with and which I want to mention in the debate. Ed Casey, State Minister for Primary Industries in Queensland, has outlined a strategy which the Queensland Government will develop now it has signed the agreement to be part of the management of this marvellous river basin. The strategy has now been published in a document that was the outcome of community discussions during the period July to December 1992; that is, immediately following the Goss Government's signing into the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key element of the strategy is to address natural resource management issues in the Murray-Darling Basin in Queensland through a community based structure. The initial steps outlined here are as follows: first, to form catchment coordinating committees drawn from a broad community base in the Condamine, border rivers, Maranoa-Balonne and Warrego-Paroo catchments; to form a regional catchment coordinating committee which provides a forum for overview of natural resource management in the total catchment; and to develop catchment management strategies to address both the short- and long-term natural resource issues identified by the community and government. He goes on to say that the outcome will be a viable, productive community, and long-term sustainable and balanced use of our land, water and related biological resources, which of course is the hope in these matters.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland State Government has initiated these regional catchment coordinating committees and local strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A group in which I am involved, the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers, was first formed in Ballarat by a farmer in, I think, the early 1980s. This group sends out volunteers in order to do good works in the reclamation of land, often at the behest of farmers, but not for commercial work. It does a great deal of work&mdash;as much as community volunteer effort counts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sending a signal here to my Queensland State colleagues that they need to appreciate the work of the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers. As part of their initiative in stimulating community work about the management of these subcatchment areas my colleagues ought to get in touch with the ATCV to continue the good relationship that has started to build up with the trust. I refer to some notes which the ATCV has provided for me about its work in the Murray-Darling Basin:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers exists to involve the community in the care and maintenance of its environment. This is achieved by the organisation of practical conservation projects and associated activities involving schools and community groups.</PARA>
<PARA>It claims, and this is true, that it is well suited to working in the Murray-Darling Basin, which is sparsely populated and covers an enormous area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATCV is, in effect, a highly mobile community group, able to concentrate its resources in particular areas for a specific length of time. Resources include a team of up to 10 volunteers, an ATCV team leader, an ATCV vehicle, trailer, tools, first aid equipment, food and camping equipment. These teams have worked in the Murray-Darling Basin for many years, carrying out a wide variety of projects ranging from maintenance of the Alpine walking track at the headwaters of the Murray to seed collection in some of the driest areas of the basin near Broken Hill. Other projects have included a mallee fowl survey in conjunction with landcare groups, wetlands rehabilitation at Wellington in New South Wales and improvements to an arboretum in southern Queensland. Besides the numerous hands-on projects, the ATCV has also targeted numerous students in the basin. At Cobar in New South Wales local students were given the opportunity to visit and work with local mining companies on mine rehabilitation. At Echuca in Victoria, the ATCV assisted a local school to regenerate a degraded bushland adjoining the school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early 1993, an ATCV team travelled to remote schools in the western district of New South Wales, raising environmental awareness by a mixture of talks and workshop activities. As a result, most of the schools resolved to form environmental committees which subsequently identified projects and formed strategies, taking into account local issues which had been discussed during the visit. The ATCV has a Murray-Darling Basin project officer, funded by the Federal Government through the natural resources management strategy. This officer is based in Canberra and travels throughout the basin, generating projects in conjunction with the appropriate ATCV State managers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, the ATCV has worked consistently in that part of the State which lies in the Murray-Darling Basin. It makes comment, and this needs to be said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the signing of the Murray Darling Basin agreement by the Queensland Government has yet to make any noticeable difference to the work of the ATCV in Queensland. A series of community workshops were held in the Murray Darling Basin in September 1992. The outcomes of these workshops were to form the basis for the initial strategic plan. The strategy has just been released by the Queensland Government and as a result no projects have been implemented under the Murray Darling Basin initiative in Queensland involving ATCV.</PARA>
<PARA>I make a plea to the Queensland Government, now that it has become involved in the management of the entire area, to include all of those who want to work to help to rehabilitate and better manage this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those groups is the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers. I think that group is worthy of support. It is a means by which we can take city people and put them out in the bush to help the likes of those good people, such as the honourable member for Wakefield, who understand the area better but could do with a bit of assistance from people in the city. If the Queensland Government can see its way clear to assist these sorts of projects using volunteer labour from the city, then I would certainly encourage it to do so. I support the Bill. </PARA>

The only conclusion that I can come to is that the Prime Minister was frightened to come into this place and answer some of the questions about the Government's administration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise in this House an issue of extreme importance: the rapidly rising rate of crime in Tasmania, the inadequate policing and crime prevention system in my home State and the consequential discrimination that has occurred through the policies of insurance companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania is experiencing serious economic problems which are currently being exacerbated by a State government that has weak leadership and is lacking direction at this critical time. The results of these two problems are a rise in the number of burglaries and vandalism and other frightening signs of social breakdown. When this type of breakdown occurs no sector of the community feels it harder than low-income housing areas. It is also true to say that these areas are least well equipped to cope with these types of problems in terms of their ability to buy their way out of these problems or to strongly advocate for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant consequence of the problems I have briefly outlined is that some insurance companies have identified so-called `high risk areas'. Those areas are not affluent areas, nor middle class, but broadacre public housing areas. It is not clear that there are any more burglaries or any more vandalisms occurring in public housing areas than there is in other areas of our community. I challenge insurance companies to provide information that would show that this is the case. However, the point is that people on low incomes are not in a position to buy back items that are stolen from their homes or, at worst, find accommodation if their home is lost in a fire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office has carried out a survey of 17 insurance companies that operate in southern Tasmania. I am pleased to say that some of these companies are avoiding policies of discrimination but I am appalled by those companies that have developed discriminatory policies that have clearly identified low income earners as insurance risks and have indiscriminately penalised those people for who they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the information that was gathered in the survey by my office. Of the 17 companies that were surveyed, only five claimed that their company did not have a policy of identifying areas of so-called high risk. Companies such as AAMI, Avco, MMI and QBE all claimed that any person seeking a policy would be treated equally no matter what area that person lived in. These companies claimed that they did not necessarily require deadlocks and other security fittings before a new policy would be considered. I commend those companies for their even-handed approach and applaud them at a time when there are obvious problems in the community that have implications for insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are other insurance companies that have decided upon a different approach in their dealings with the community. Companies like the RACT, MLC, Mercantile Mutual, Sun Alliance, Commercial Union, AMP, FAI, Davey and Scurrah, the Tasmanian Government Insurance Office and CIC are less receptive when a potential client rings from a public housing area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are degrees of discrimination that are applied by these companies. For instance, AMP says that some of its best clients come from public housing areas. However, AMP has a policy that people who live in certain postcode areas which also happen to include public housing areas must pay an extra $5 a year for their policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Mercantile Mutual a member of my survey team was initially advised that this company did not decline to provide insurance in any area, but that before any further details were provided the name and address of the inquirer had to be given. As soon as the public housing suburb of Bridgewater was mentioned, the following questions were asked: have you any convictions for arson or breaking and entering, and have you made any claims in the last five years? I do not think that any member of this House who rang an insurance company inquiring about household insurance would be asked those questions. I do not think that anyone who rang from a middle class suburb would be asked those questions either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have identified a serious problem concerning the policies of certain insurance companies but I do not think for a minute that it is the underlying problem facing our community. Insurance companies are simply responding to serious problems in our community and are making commercial decisions. As I have pointed out, though, some of those commercial decisions are dubious at the very least. The real problem, the problem that insurance companies are responding to, is the lack of unity in our community, the lack of education and personal and group direction and inadequate crime prevention and policing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the Groom Liberal Government is struggling with the issues of unity, education, policing and crime prevention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask you, Mr Speaker: what is the purpose of this exercise? I can stand here and be indignant, but I have had something to say about the Bill. How does the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) feel? Everyone in the Parliament was waiting for his contribution, and he is to be denied that until the third week in August; and he is not alone. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), whose electorate adjoins the Albury area and who has a distinct interest in the Bill, is to be denied a contribution. The shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), has no opportunity to participate in debate on the Bill until the third week in August. Until almost September we are to be denied the wisdom of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), a Queenslander, who for the first time could have spoken authoritatively on what is happening to the Murray-Darling Basin. Not to mention the new honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) who has a direct interest in this Bill, who had prepared comments on it and is to be unable to make a contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the Government may say that the Bill is not urgent. If the Bill is not urgent, that is no excuse for suddenly giving us an early mark on this last sitting Thursday. I would have thought that in the driest State in the driest continent in the world there was a real urgency about any Bill that dealt with water. Now we are to be denied the very changes that the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) said we most needed until August. Why? Here we are prepared to debate the Bill. Here we are, not even at the normal adjournment time of the Parliament, not only unable to participate in this debate which would ensure that the money is to be committed to the Murray-Darling Basin but also unable to give the legislative identity to the Queenslanders until August. Apparently it was not so urgent after all. Apparently the way in which the honourable member for Prospect chose to chasten previous conservative governments and suggest that it was only the Goss Government that had been prepared to do anything about this was in error, because it is no longer urgent enough to involve the Goss Government until September this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, we are treating the Murray-Darling Basin, this Bill, the area and the Australian economy as if there were no crisis at all, no need for debate, no need for participation. Look at any one of the agricultural and horticultural industries in that basin. Any one of those issues could be the subject of debate in this Parliament. What do we choose to do? Not only do we refuse to debate those issues prior to the normal adjournment time, but we have sat, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has said, only 10 days in eight months. We would have been happy to be here on Tuesday and had some debating. We would be happy to return next week. We are going to have a situation in which the Parliament will not even be convened in June. The Government chooses this in the light of what is not only a crisis in the Murray-Darling Basin&mdash;and that Bill is not to be debated&mdash;but also a crisis in the Australian economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I wish to raise relates to penalties for women who have received sole parent benefits while cohabiting with a male partner. Many of these women have been in vulnerable situations and may have been coerced by a man into claiming the benefit after entering into a relationship. I have a constituent, a young woman, who, at the age of 17, entered into a relationship with an older man.

This case highlights a structural problem in the administration of social security benefits. Some people, chiefly women&mdash;and chiefly those otherwise eligible for sole parent pensions&mdash;may come into circumstances where, due to the differing social status of men and women, they are vulnerable to being bullied into accepting a man into their home, wallet and heart.

This places the man in the situation where, if he did inform DSS of his existence, she would lose any access to financial support for herself and her children. In many cases, the children of the woman are the children of a previous relationship. The man, who has come into her life, claims that he has no obligation to support them. She is entitled to child maintenance from the natural father but he may be a non-payer, absent, dead or in gaol or he may take the view that, if his ex is now in a new relationship, he, the original father, is not going to contribute a cent to the household of his rival.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should the DSS investigate the circumstances and take the view that the arrangement constitutes a marriage-like relationship, it is solely the woman who bears the burden of making repayments and the threat of prosecution, notwithstanding that the man has had the benefit of the payment and has been instrumental in her obtaining the benefits. The woman may be able to take legal action against the man. However, the law dictates that during the relationship all assets, however derived, are shared. She can make a claim under the Family Law Act of a de facto relationship to recover the money from the man by way of spouse maintenance or property settlement but, if there are no available assets, then she is kicking an empty can. It is significant that legal aid is not usually available in these circumstances. Often there is no prosecution, only debt recovery action and the DSS has no power over the man unless as a result of prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In raising the issue, I am by no means condoning the actions of women who claim benefits illegally and I fully endorse the recovery of funds in these cases.

An amendment could be made to the Social Security Act to create an additional offence of knowingly deriving or participating in the derivation of a benefit improperly or fraudulently obtained from the Commonwealth. The definition of beneficiary and pensioner could be amended to include those who voluntarily derive a benefit to which they are not entitled. It would also be possible to appropriately amend the debt recovery provisions of the Act, regulations and other documents to include persons benefiting from such payments. I hope that some resolution can be found to this problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight for a very special cause: to appeal to the Government on the grounds of equity to support funding for the Wanaaring contact children's mobile. I am not advocating any extra government spending, I am advocating a fair share for remote areas. There has been much talk in this country over recent months about child-care spending and the Government was splashing around hundreds of millions of dollars during the election campaign. I remind the Government that my electorate of Parkes takes in 40 per cent of New South Wales. While Dubbo is the major centre, the north-west corner of my electorate has a great need for children's education services. There are many remote properties, most of them tens of kilometres from their neighbour, hundreds of kilometres from the nearest small town and even a small town such as Tibooburra is 1,200 kilometres from Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The children's contact mobile was set up in 1987, funded not by the Government at all but by the Bernard van Leer Foundation. That funding cuts out on 30 June of this year. The mobile has a Toyota landcruiser, two teachers and backup and technical staff and travels to the most disadvantaged localities in New South Wales. It travels to towns such as White Cliffs, Louth, Yantabulla, Hungerford and Wanaaring and points further north over the Queensland border, covering an area greater than the size of Tasmania. The mobile visits something like 200 parents and children every month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contact children's mobile aims to overcome the social, cultural, educational and geographic isolation that those children suffer. Those children live on farms, many with no electricity at all. Some have no television because their parents cannot afford the dish. Most have no bitumen roads. More than half do not even have the support of the local government because they live in the unincorporated area, and most of them have a very deficient postal service. They are lucky to get one service per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These children have no physical contact with other children and have few social skills compared with those who live in more populated areas. They have limited opportunities to develop their language skills and limited speech opportunities. On top of that, there is the issue of the loneliness of the parents, particularly the women, and this is particularly heightened now at a time of severe rural recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contact children's mobile calls in at a property, others come into the area, and the children have the opportunity to meet other children, play together, enjoy each other's company, participate in group activities, and partake in plays, music and other shared activities with the equipment and guidance of the contact children's mobile. The parents are welcome and encouraged to attend and assist, and they pick up useful ideas to take back home to use in their children's further education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health education is also a very important part of this mobile's activities. It puts out low-cost printed media facilities. It has audio and visual presentations and there is great community support and goodwill for what it has been doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The children's mobile has been running on a shoestring of a little over $200,000 per year, with purely voluntary funding up to date, and it has cut its budget to the bone. Its budget for next year is not much more than $100,000, and it believes that this time the Federal Government should come in, through the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services, which already funds contact projects for isolated children. We believe the funding should be extended to this area where the need is even greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, to hear the pleas of these people so that this contact children's mobile can continue. If it has to shut down after 30 June this year, it will be a tragedy indeed for those isolated and remote children who have lived under disadvantaged conditions until now. I believe this is the very least the Government can do so that children living in this area get a fair crack of the whip of the money that is being spent in child care and other areas in more populated areas. </PARA>

The students in these two small country high schools will talk directly to the United Nations General Assembly from the Broadford Secondary College using both telephone and some form of audio link displaying a visual image on a screen in New York.

For a few years the Broadford students have been heavily involved in practical environmental and education programs, especially International UV Watch, which they have pioneered and now network through IEARN. The school's magazine, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Icarus</EMPHASIS>, is now issued to schools all over the world.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise my alarm as a new member of this place observing the Government over the last eight days of sittings and seeing a dramatic illustration of Executive Government running rampant over the Parliament and the rights of the people. Whilst I congratulate the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) on talking about what the young people in his electorate will be doing&mdash;and I wish them well&mdash;I regret very much that from my observations of this place since the Parliament opened there has been nothing done by the Government at all to improve the prospects of those children and other children in Australia. In fact, their future is being undermined by this Government. If I had the temerity to give a report card on this Government for its first eight days of this new Parliament, I would give it minus 10, and that is a generous mark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an overview. Just tonight we have seen the curtailment of a debate on a major piece of legislation, the Murray-Darling Basin Bill. We have tried for years to include Queensland in it. Queensland is now in it, but the legislation which has already gone through the Victorian and New South Wales parliaments stopped dead in the Federal Parliament. Yet our largest resource, our greatest food producing basin in Australia, is waiting for the Federal Government to take a lead. What has it done? After 30-odd years of negotiation with Queensland, it has blown it. That is a very stark illustration of the stupidity of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point I would like to make is that we saw this week an attack on, in effect, an independent officer of the Parliament&mdash;the Auditor-General. We saw from the Government a shameful attack on the Auditor-General and, by the denial of Question Time today, a curtailment of the right to probe and question when, of course, the Government would have been held to be more accountable for the unwarranted criticism of the Auditor-General's report. The report only disclosed, mind you, what the liabilities of this Commonwealth are with respect to debt. That is an important issue and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), his Ministers and the Treasury attacked the integrity of the Auditor-General and his staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had the TV fiasco&mdash;the so-called tender situation that I have observed. Other Australians have been alarmed at the way in which the tradition of ministerial responsibility has now been sullied and altered. We now have a report which the Government is hanging its hat on. I do not want to get personal about the person who wrote the report, but the effect of that report is that no Minister of the Crown, according to this Federal Government, can ever be made responsible or accountable at all so long as there is a cover sheet on the file on which there is an initial from a public servant or a permanent head saying `recommended'. There is no reason to probe or to question; there is no reason to evaluate the interests of the nation by a Minister of the Crown; there is nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has now laid down new and frightening standards&mdash;or lack of standards. That will be the mark of this Government for the next three years. I say, `Heaven help Australia; heaven help the Parliament'. Yesterday we saw a cowardly attack by the Prime Minister on the President of the RSL, Brigadier Garland, who had the temerity to hand a flag of this nation to his Prime Minister&mdash;in good faith, in good fun, in good humour. To hear the Prime Minister's attack on Brigadier Garland, his cowardly slurs on why this flag was given to him, the reference to our British heritage and the denigration of our history is something that makes one's hair turn grey. The Prime Minister has caused the recession. Here we are with people unemployed, but he is now dividing the nation and attacking someone who had the temerity to hand him&mdash;the Prime Minister of Australia&mdash;the flag of his own nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament is now shutting down at the end of the session. The Government could not run a grocer shop. It put legislation on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and told us that it all had to go through. We are quite happy to accommodate the Government and to sit on. We make arrangements to speak, but we cannot even bring to the Government's attention&mdash;this is how stupid it is&mdash;the need to fund some of the programs affected by the legislation. We cannot even alert it to those things. The Government will now have to find out the hard way. My report card, minus 10, is a generous overestimate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem is not the member; it is a problem relating to a bypass of the city of Launceston. It has been an ongoing problem for 30 years across governments of both parties. In the 1960s, the bypass was proposed as part of the section of ring-road around Launceston. In 1967, there was a second proposal. Ten years on, in 1977, another study was done. In 1988, the Tamar region road study was completed at long last to update the previous study. And so it went on. But no timing was shown in the works proposal for the eastern bypass other than that it was listed as the second highest priority urban road project after the East Tamar Highway extension. The East Tamar Highway extension was completed last year, following a study back in 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, the Launceston City Council once again engaged consultants to look at this problem. The study found that in terms of benefit and cost and to best serve the amenity needs of both the eastern bypass area and the Glebe area of Launceston the road link south of the North Esk provided the best solution&mdash;that is, the eastern bypass. However, this solution indicated separation between regional and local needs&mdash;another excuse&mdash;so it was out of the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, the council extended the brief to consultants, and the finding in that study involved the Launceston City Council taking up the issue of the Glebe bypass. Once again this year the Department of Roads and Transport is funding a further study of the Tamar region to reassess construction priorities and to review the functional use of classified roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has gone on and on for 30 years. On behalf of constituents in my seat of Bass, I will continue to bring this to the attention of the House. The road element costings amount to $20 million, and a further subsection worth $2.5 million has now been undertaken by the local government. It will provide a bypass, an alternative truck route, away from the Launceston central business district. The road component of the proposal&mdash;namely, the eastern connector and the Henry Street upgrading&mdash;is listed in the Tamar regional road study as the next highest priority after the East Tamar outlet which is now completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The council has funded two studies; the Glebe study has been completed. I ask this Government to seriously consider the next study by the council regarding these two issues. I draw to the Government's attention the fact that the bypass is needed to divert traffic&mdash;up to 40 log trucks per day&mdash;from going through a high residential area. This is causing major structural problems in the area, not only to the roads but also to the housing development. It is a very serious problem with a priority need that is No. 1. The transport economy favours the movement of forest based products in our State and in my electorate, but we certainly need to be looking at those roads. I bring to the attention of honourable members an article in the Australian Automobile Association newsletter on the role of roads in our future:</PARA>

In a debate two weeks ago in this House I urged the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to consider returning drought to the list of natural disasters. It is quite unfair that a cyclone, flood or fire like we had on Black Friday in Victoria and South Australia can command the attention of Australian people and allow the government to make contributions over and above those made for drought, yet drought is not regarded as a natural diaster.

When serving as part of our Australian armed forces in the Middle East he was left behind by his ship, along with Australian equipment possibly worth hundres of thousands of dollars in today's terms. Apparently and amazingly, it was never discovered that he was left behind.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As many of my colleagues have said, three things have been highlighted by this Government since 13 March. Firstly, it has shown a large degree of parliamentary irresponsibility; secondly, it has shown a very high degree of arrogance; and, finally, it has shown a complete disregard for the little people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) hit the nail on the head when he talked about the situation in the drought-ridden areas of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should take notice of what happened in the city of Toowoomba last Tuesday morning when 1,100 people sat down to a prayer breakfast, the proceeds of which were going to drought relief. The Prime Minister should understand that a lot of little people out there&mdash;particularly those in the bush&mdash;are hurting. But this has been mentioned in the House before. In Charleville, in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), 40 people receive food parcels every fortnight. Quite recently one lady rang the appeal in which I have been involved and said, `Thank you very much for the food parcel, but do you think that my husband could have a pair of boots so that he can work the farm?'. That is the extent to which people in the bush are experiencing problems at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bishop Wicks, a retired Anglican Bishop, said at the prayer breakfast on Tuesday morning that people out there should get angry. I agree with him; I hope they will. They should get angry with the parliamentary processes which we have seen prostituted this week and in the weeks leading up to this final two days of sitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I would like to comment not only in terms of the Government's irresponsibility inside this House, but also in terms of its irresponsibility outside this House. This is epitomised in a letter I received quite recently; I am sure a lot of my colleagues have received similar letters. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's methodology in promoting so-called safe sexual practices among homosexuals has in the past caused me grave misgivings. Whilst recognising that steps must be taken to minimise the spread of the AIDS virus and acknowledging that homosexuals constitute 95 per cent or more of the identified cases of fully developed AIDS, the program was flawed in my opinion in that it failed to recognise, even implicitly, that homosexual activity involving multiple partners was a grossly irresponsible practice, all moral considerations aside.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advertising, particularly on television, used fear of contracting the disease as a means of promoting safer practices without in any way suggesting that by this very activity these people were ultimately putting the wider population at grave risk. No attempt was made to discourage such practices, not doubt due at least in part to the fear that the people responsible would be accused wrongly of being discriminatory. No attempt in fact was made in any way to suggest that the practice was anything than normal, a point of view to which a very large proportion of our population, normally very tolerant, would not subscribe.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Be that as it may, I am frankly outraged to find that the Government is now permitting taxpayer funds to be used to promote homosexuality as a way of life. I refer to the recent advertising carried by the national press and funded by the Department of Health portraying a mother with her homosexual son. Not only is she depicted as being quite reconciled to his homosexual bent but also as being quite favourably disposed towards it. This advertisement is much more about homosexuality as a lifestyle than it is about disease prevention. No government has a right to use taxpayers' funds for this purpose and I suspect it was probably not intended to be used as such. At the bottom it makes a few suggestions about information and where to obtain it, but essentially it is selling the product homosexuality.</PARA>
<PARA>It concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In permitting and contributing to this mischievous and quite misleading advertisement, the Government and your Department&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the letter was written to Senator Richardson&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in particular has been grossly inept and irresponsible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Punch) at the table. I had the pleasure of joining him on the parliamentary delegation to the European Institutions and the Netherlands, but I am not going to spare him one bit on this particular issue. I want him to take note of this very important issue that I wish to raise in the House concerning federal funding for Victoria and the terrible situation that the Commonwealth has placed it in with respect to road funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria contributes 27 per cent of total fuel excise receipts in that State. When I look at the indicative federal funding for roads in Victoria over the next three years, I find that of the 27 per cent of fuel excise collected by the Commonwealth in the 1993-94 financial year only 19.1 per cent will be returned to Victoria. Victoria's roads are in dire need of upgrading. In my own electorate I have many bridges that need replacing&mdash;one that immediately comes to mind is at Newbridge on the way to St Arnaud. But we have a shortfall in the return which Victorian motorists are contributing to the federal coffers by way of fuel excise. Out of a total of 27 per cent, only 19.1 per cent will be returned to Victoria in the year 1993-94&mdash;a total of $234.1 million&mdash;when in fact more than $300 million in road funding should be returned to that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation does not improve; in fact, over the next two years it will deteriorate even further. The indicative federal funding for Victoria in 1994-95 will drop to 17.1 per cent of the total excise contribution which Victorian motorists make. They are being short-changed by 10 per cent in the actual collection of fuel excise in Victoria. The total figure in dollar terms is $199.7 million. There is another startling reduction in 1995-96, when the figure will drop to 16.2 per cent, with total receipts for fuel excise returned to the Commonwealth at a level of 27 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation cannot be allowed to continue. It is causing tremendous problems for local and state governments in Victoria which are trying to finance the roads and keep them in good condition. One of my major concerns is that the Calder Highway&mdash;which runs from Melbourne to Bendigo, proceeds north to Mildura, links up with the national highway at Mildura and with the Sturt Highway to Adelaide&mdash;may not be upgraded to national highway standard because of the shortfall in funds. Since it is the main road between Melbourne and Bendigo&mdash;Bendigo being the second largest manufacturing area in Victoria&mdash;it is imperative that there be a four-lane highway between those two cities. If federal funding continues to diminish, that four-lane highway between Bendigo and Melbourne will not be completed until the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation should be redressed by returning the fuel excise tax to Victoria at the appropriate level of 27 per cent. That would enable the highway to be duplicated all the way from Melbourne to Bendigo at a satisfactory national highway standard. The road is one of the most important arteries or links between those cities, although there is a very good rail link. Road transport generally needs to be kept at a high level and the quality of the roads between Melbourne and Bendigo needs to be upgraded. We should also remember that this particular road leads to the northern areas of Mildura, where much of the State's produce comes from. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
