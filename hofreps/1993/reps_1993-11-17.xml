<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a matter of privilege. On Thursday last, 11 November 1993, I was served with a writ of summons issued out of the Supreme Court of the ACT, dated 21 September, naming one Anthony Robinson as plaintiff, myself as first named defendant and Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Ltd as the second defendant. The writ was issued by a Canberra firm of solicitors&mdash;namely, Gary Robb and Associates of 29 Torrens Street, Braddon, ACT. The writ seeks damages for libel against me arising from a letter I forwarded on Friday, 20 August of this year to Senator the Hon. Bob McMullan, the responsible minister, concerning the proposed reorganisation and restructure of the Commonwealth car fleet in Brisbane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plaintiff in the proceedings&mdash;namely, Anthony Robinson&mdash;is a Canberra based bureaucrat who, I understand, is the acting national manager of the Comcar organisation. I mention in passing that I do not know the gentleman personally and, to the best of my knowledge, I cannot recollect ever setting eyes on the man and I certainly bear him no malice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time leading up to the 1993 budget, and indeed since that time, I have been extensively lobbied by drivers employed by the Comcar organisation throughout Australia&mdash;particularly in Brisbane&mdash;who have been concerned about their future employment prospects. There has been for some time now continual rumours of the impending closure, or at least massive scaling down, of Comcar operations in some states. A substantial number of drivers have been very concerned about their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, as a result of a meeting of a number of drivers in Queensland, I was approached to make representations and generally try to assist the drivers in their continual perceived struggle to secure their employment. Given that out of some 35 or so drivers working out of the Comcar Brisbane depot approximately eight of them live in my electorate of Bowman and are known personally to me&mdash;as are all other drivers in Brisbane, I might add&mdash;I agreed to help them as a group in any way I could. In the normal course of events and in my usual practice of dealing with general constituent matters as a member of the House of Representatives, I caused inquiries to be made of the minister's office and I generally discussed the situation of the drivers with some of my parliamentary colleagues. From time to time I would report the results of my actions to various Comcar drivers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget there were decisions, of which I was unaware, which impacted quite markedly on the general operation of the Comcar organisation. I was again requested to make representations on behalf of the drivers. Accordingly, given that the budget decisions were not in accord with what I thought would be the case and following strong representations made to me on my return to Brisbane from Canberra at the end of the budget week&mdash;namely, Friday, 20 August 1993&mdash;I caused a letter to be written and faxed that same morning to Senator McMullan. The letter was forwarded by me on behalf of my constituents&mdash;namely, the Brisbane drivers employed by Comcar. As is my normal practice when I sincerely believe a constituent has a very strong case, I couched my letter in very strong terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my normal practice to provide my constituents with a copy of representations I have made on their behalf. Knowing that the drivers were anxious to learn what action I had taken, I gave a copy of my letter to the Comcar driver who, that same morning, was driving me into the city where I was to represent the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) at an official function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My duty as a member of parliament is to represent the interests of my constituents and people who ask for my assistance to the best of my ability and without fear or favour. I believe that any action which inhibits me or attempts to inhibit me in carrying out my duties is a serious matter that should properly be dealt with by the appropriate forums of this House. I believe that in this instance the issuing and serving of a writ without any warning is deliberately intended to intimidate me as a member of parliament and is an attempt to seriously curtail my continued representations on behalf of my constituents, in this case the drivers employed by Comcar in Brisbane and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this rather unique situation in which I find myself has wider implications for all present and future members of this House. There is no question that a member of parliament who faces the possibility of court action every time he writes a letter to a minister which is critical of a public servant will be naturally impeded in carrying out his representations to the fullest extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe I have a duty to my colleagues in this place to have the whole question deliberated upon by the Standing Committee of Privileges so that honourable members can be made aware of their position. I refuse to allow a senior Canberra based bureaucrat to stop me from trying to help save people's jobs simply because he issues a writ against me. This would create an undesirable precedent which would have ongoing repercussions for all members of this House who may from time to time wish to strongly and vigorously represent the interests of their constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no comment as to the substance of the allegations made in the writ as I believe that would be improper and should properly be determined by a court in the normal course. But I ask that this matter, in so far as it relates to my actions as a member of parliament acting on behalf of constituents, be referred by you to the Standing Committee of Privileges and given priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I submit the following documents for your consideration in determining the matter: first, a copy of a letter dated 20 August 1993 to Senator McMullan; and, secondly, a writ of summons dated 21 September 1993. </PARA>

I recall warning people outside this chamber that this sort of thing would happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When honourable members propose legislation and vote for it, if it comes round and belts them right between the eyes later on, then I think they ought to pause and reflect on their action in this House when they voted for it in the first place. This is a defamation action and the changes that curtailed the power of the privileges committee curtailed that power by giving citizens the right to institute proceedings against members of parliament&mdash;who ought to be as liable under the law for statements that they make as any other citizen, save and accept for what applies in here for the privilege that is given to elected representatives to stretch that a little bit further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no qualms about this matter. I am Deputy Chairman of the privileges committee. Mr Speaker, you will determine, not me, whether the matter comes before the privileges committee. But I am sitting here as a member of the committee listening to an honourable member who voted for legislation which brought this very situation about and who says that he is severely restricted in what he can say. He has not told the House what he said in the first place. I do not know what the subject of complaint is. I have listened to an impassioned speech, but I would not have a clue what the matter is that is being complained about. The letter has not been provided to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to make a response and say that I will view this matter objectively as Deputy Chairman of the privileges committee. But I get a little bit sick of the humbug in this House, particularly from people on the other side who complain about their rights being constrained when they are the ones who initiated the constraint to their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the letter is couched in the normal terms that we would expect of an honourable member forcibly arguing his case, then so be it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, with your indulgence: I am a little taken aback by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), but I take his advice on board. We all should be very careful of what we do. From time to time I believe I have written letters that are exceptionally strong in language and highly critical of certain public servants, including senior public servants. I think all members of the House have done this from time to time in the belief that they have an unfettered right to vigorously represent all their constituents but especially those that feel perhaps powerless to pursue their rights and claims in other ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned about the matter that the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) has raised, because I think that it will affect us all. If, when we write to a minister, we have to consider the tone, language and content of how we represent views vigorously, I fear for the ability of honourable members to adequately represent their constituents. It would be a farce if, every time we wanted to raise something vigorously and in strong language, we had to get up and, in effect, read letters to ministers in this House. I believe that 90-second statements would take on a totally new meaning and adjournment debates could be quite interesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sincerely hope, Mr Speaker, that you will consider the matters raised by the honourable member for Bowman because I think they are serious and they affect us all. If, as the honourable member for Kooyong suggests, we need to change the legislation of the privileges committee to provide protection for members of this House in this way, then that is something that we ought to contemplate. </PARA>

Often, circumstances arise which give effect to the wisdom of hindsight, and that will certainly be listened to. But I certainly urge you and the members of the privilege committee, if the matter is referred to the committee, to consider it on its merits and not see the matter as something that proves a point which may have been made at some time in the past.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am pleased to present the report of an inquiry of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the Australian Taxation Office. This report concludes a two-year investigation by the committee into the administration of one of this country's largest and most significant institutions. For probably the first time in Australia, a parliamentary committee has extensively investigated the manner in which income tax is collected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry was undertaken in recognition of the enormous changes in all aspects of the tax office and tax administration commenced during the 1980s under the banner of modernisation. These reforms, principally engineered by the former Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Trevor Boucher, were acknowledged by witnesses before the committee as revolutionary and even evolutionary. This inquiry was commenced during the previous parliament under the chairmanship of my colleague the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch). I pay tribute to the significant contribution made to this inquiry by him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to outline the history of this inquiry and to place on the public record a brief summary of the work undertaken by the committee in preparing this report. The inquiry's terms of reference were agreed in November 1991 and publicly announced in January 1992. After a period for the reception and analysis of public submissions, the committee conducted a number of private inspections of tax office facilities. At the end of May 1992 the committee commenced a series of public hearings. Between June and October, 13 public hearings were conducted in Canberra, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Several of those hearings were notable for, amongst other things, the media interest that they generated in the work of committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of October 1992 the committee concluded its public hearings and a preliminary draft report was prepared for consideration by members. Over the Christmas period, honourable members were requested to provide written or oral comments on the preliminary report to the secretary. Several members did this and in January of this year the committee reconvened to consider a draft report incorporating honourable members' suggestions. This draft formed the basis of the committee's deliberations this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the resumption of parliament after the March election, the committee determined to resume the inquiry. That decision was taken in recognition of the sizeable amount of information already gathered, the significant effort demonstrated by witnesses and those who had made submissions to the committee, and the consequent need to fulfil the public expectation that the committee would complete this task. In June two further public hearings with witnesses from the tax office were held. These hearings served to update the information collected the previous year and provided new committee members with the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the issues and raise their own points of interest. The committee accepted 125 public submissions accounting for over 5,000 pages of evidence from ordinary taxpayers, academics, taxpayer agents and industry representatives, accounting and legal professionals, officers of the tax office, senior tax office management and many others. In addition, it received more than 40 exhibits and considered a number of confidential documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to thank all of those who have contributed to the committee's investigation. In particular, I take this opportunity to thank the current Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael Carmody, and his staff for their cooperation and assistance. I also express the committee's gratitude to the former commissioner, Mr Trevor Boucher, who, as honourable members will note on page 4 of the report, retired in the course of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conclusion of the two additional public hearings, the committee commenced an intense program of meetings for the purpose of considering this report. Indeed, since May the sectional committee met on no fewer than 14 occasions to consider the report. In addition, a private meeting was held with the Commissioner of Taxation and one of the second commissioners to enable some of the committee's proposals to be discussed in general terms. In October the committee resolved to engage the services of a consultant to review the report and to propose amendments in respect of the report's technical accuracy. I take this opportunity to thank Mr Peter Dowling of Ernst and Young for his assistance and advice. The committee found his experience and practical observations to be exceptionally valuable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At no stage has the committee acted to bring forward this report with undue haste. On the contrary, the fact that this extensive report has been tabled today is testament to the exceptional commitment of members of the public accounts committee and, in particular, to the members of the sectional committee formed to consider this inquiry. In particular, I pay tribute to Senator Watson, the former vice-chairman of the sectional committee, who has been fully involved in the report's formulation. Senator Watson's interest in the report extended with the full concurrence of the committee to reading and reviewing the text even after his formal resignation from the committee in August due to a heavy workload with Senate committees. I thank him for his advice and support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take this opportunity to thank the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) for his enthusiasm and encouragement throughout the inquiry. To the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), who participated at no small cost to himself in the full development of the committee's recommendations, I extend on behalf of the committee our thanks and best wishes for a swift recovery. I also acknowledge the work of my colleague the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) who, along with the honourable member for Fairfax, has participated in the inquiry from its establishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the other members of the sectional committee in this House&mdash;the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin), the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland), the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile)&mdash;and to all of the members of the full committee who have gone out of their way to attend and participate in the report's consideration, I commend them for their dedication to a difficult and challenging task. This report is a tribute the parliamentary committee system and to the diligence and bipartisanship of committee members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the remarkable work of the public accounts committee secretariat. To the committee secretary, Mr Trevor Rowe, to Ms Geraldine Skinner, and to Ms Sue Morton, who served at various points as secretary to the sectional committee, I express my thanks for their professionalism and tolerance during a long and at times difficult inquiry. To all of the staff of the secretariat, who particularly in recent weeks have spend unduly long and weary hours in reviewing, proof reading and perfecting this report, I extend both personally and on behalf of the committee a genuine tribute to them for their capacity and patience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, personally and on behalf of the committee, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Simon Edwards, seconded from the Department of Finance, who performed the research for the inquiry and did most of the writing of this report. His dedication and commitment to the task were exceptional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that all honourable members will agree from experience that it is through the dedication of our committee staff that the excellent work and reputation of our committees continue to grow. The committee's report is a comprehensive assessment of the administration of the Australian Taxation Office. While it is critical where necessary, it also recognises and commends the tax office for its many innovative and positive achievements, particularly in the areas of modernisation, self-assessment, personnel management and revenue collection. The report puts forward 148 recommendations, all of which I will not attempt to cover in this statement. However, I would like to highlight to the House a few of the areas in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evaluating the tax office's performance, the committee has considered the efficiency of administering the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The committee has recognised that which must be painfully obviously to all in this parliament: the act is long overdue for a redraft. The resolve to simplify the act must come from within this place. A commitment across political lines will be necessary for any redraft or rewriting to be effective. The committee has recognised that to redraft the act and simplify its administration will not be an easy process, nor will it be quick or inexpensive. Nevertheless, in the committee's view, a redraft must be commenced urgently. The committee therefore recommends that sufficient resources be devoted to this exercise as a matter of the highest priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 80 years, the committee considers the time is ripe for the establishment of a new administrative framework for the tax office. The committee has considered a number of options including the establishment of a board of management. This proposal was considered inappropriate for our taxation system. To be effective, it would require that the general powers of taxation administration be vested in a collective group. Such an unwieldy administrative structure would reduce parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has determined that the tax office should be constituted under its own act as the Australian Taxation Commission. Through such a commission, all the advantages of a board can be embraced. In addition, a commission will facilitate the use of experts in executive roles on either a full- or part-time basis. A commission will also allow for a more flexible system for the employment of taxation professionals and provide the capacity to respond to changing international and domestic priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has carefully and comprehensively considered the system of private and public rulings issued by the commissioner. The committee has recognised the importance and significance of rulings for taxpayers. As an administrator, the Commissioner of Taxation has no authority to create law. Nevertheless, as a result of both legislative changes and the financial barriers in accessing judicial review, the committee acknowledges that the word of the commissioner has come to be seen by many as de facto or quasi law. The committee gave extensive consideration to proposals to make the commissioner's rulings subordinate law through the procedures of tabling and disallowance. While this mechanism would provide parliamentary scrutiny and an effective discipline in the exercise of the commissioner's powers and discretions, the committee considered that there were significant practical difficulties in such a system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the possibilities of delay and increased uncertainty, the need to establish a capacity within the parliament capable of analysing and evaluating technical and complex administrative guidelines, and the capacity of the commissioner to avoid the parliament through the issue of other administrative guidelines, were considered to be so significant as to militate against the introduction of such a system at this time. Nevertheless, the committee has concluded that parliamentary review is both necessary and desirable. The committee has recommended that all public rulings should be tabled in the parliament and be available for review by the parliament's committees. In this way, the interpretations, discretions and powers of the commissioner can be best monitored and an effective deterrent to the abuse of power established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the introduction of the self-assessment system, the importance of taxation auditing to the detection of taxpayers who fail to comply with the law has been paramount. The powers of taxation auditors to access information are both extensive and exceptional. The committee has carefully reviewed the auditing function. Its recommendations for change seek to establish a professional, independent audit operation which is balanced and efficient. Through the separation of the information gathering and analysis functions from the decision making process, the committee considers the powers of auditors can be better harnessed and the independence of final decisions enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be little doubt that access to our judicial system has become the privilege of the privileged. In the field of taxation this is even more the case as no legal aid is available to those citizens who wish to challenge a decision of the tax office. The committee has recognised this dilemma and urges the establishment of a low cost facility for the resolution of taxation claims below $5,000. While such a facility would not be judicial, it would allow issues of principle and importance to individuals to be argued and settled in a manner which is both practical and equitable. Under the committee's proposals, issues of significance could still be resolved by judicial interpretation where it was considered necessary. However, such determinations would be paid for by all taxpayers and not an individual taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has evaluated and considered a number of models for a taxpayers charter of rights. While such statements can satisfy a number of possible goals, the committee concluded that their merit lay in the focus they provided to administration. The committee considered the extent and description of what constituted a right of taxpayers should be detailed in a charter which is readily available for public scrutiny. In addition, the tax office should be required to provide standards of service in accordance with the rights detailed in the charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other major recommendations of the committee's report include the funding of a taxation ombudsman within the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Office, the removal of administrative culpability penalties, the need for a review of the financial position of the tax office and the payment by the tax office of the service fee for lodgment of tax returns on the electronic lodgment service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now comment briefly on the dissenting report lodged by Senator Bishop. I note firstly that much of the dissenting report is on matters outside the terms of reference of this inquiry. To maintain bipartisanship the committee agreed very early in its deliberation that matters of taxation policy would not be considered. Nevertheless, the dissenting report extensively canvasses issues of policy and the tax mix. Secondly, it is noted that the dissenting report does not disagree with a majority of the committee's recommendations. Furthermore, several of the recommendations in the dissenting report are included in the committee's report. Some of the reasons for the committee's conclusions from which Senator Bishop has dissented have been addressed earlier in my statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is a matter of regret, it is my duty as chairman of the committee to refute the unwarranted insinuation contained in the preface and general statements of the dissenting report. While acknowledging the contribution of Senator Bishop, as with other members of the committee, I consider her inference in respect of the work and aims of those members who participated in the report's finalisation to be condescending, irrelevant and quite offensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, while it would always be possible to find examples of deficiencies in any organisation of 18,000 people, the committee recognises that these examples are the exemptions rather than the rule. This report acknowledges that the tax office has been a progressive and generally efficient public organisation. Thus, while the committee does not condone any inefficiency, it has sought in its 148 recommendations to achieve a structure that will improve the overall administration, reduce costs and provide justice and equity to taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would again most sincerely thank the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the committee secretariat for their efforts in respect of this inquiry. I believe that this report will provide a platform for a modernised tax office to step into the 21st century as a servant of the Australian people. Like all tax assessments, this report is not all good and not all bad. Some day we will all have to come to terms with that reality. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This major report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts upon the committee's inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office, the ATO, is a culmination of two years extensive and intensive work. This report covers every significant aspect of the administration of the ATO and makes profound recommendations to effect improvement in the running of the ATO. Tax policy is not canvassed in the report, as that was beyond our terms of reference, and is a matter for the government of the day. During the inquiry, 15 public hearings were held and 128 submissions were received. Most of these submissions were of high quality and in great detail. As the member who initiated the inquiry and played the principal role in initially setting its parameters and a substantial part in its conduct throughout, it gives me great satisfaction to see it successfully brought to a conclusion today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several key recommended reforms are contained within our report upon the ATO. One of the most important is the suggested establishment of an Australian taxation commission. This proposal is made because, on the evidence before it, the committee was of the view that a wider perspective was required at the corporate management level of the ATO. Responsibilities of the ATO in contemporary Australia extend far beyond traditional revenue collection within the domestic jurisdiction. The ATO must now contend with a wide range of functions, from dealing with highly sophisticated matters in the international tax arena, through to the unique social role arising from the inclusion of the Child Support Agency within the ATO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommends that the commission consist of a chairperson, five full-time commissioners and three part-time commissioners. It is the firm belief of the committee that the retitled Chief Commissioner of Taxation, who will be one of the five full-time commissioners, must retain the power of general administration over taxation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another vital recommendation of the committee is that relating to the long overdue simplification of Australian income tax law. It is pointed out in the report that when the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 was first passed by the parliament it covered just 126 pages. Nearly 60 years later, the act and its associated material has grown to over 5,000 pages. It is little wonder that the proportion of taxpayers using tax accountants continues to grow, and that even the best tax accountants have difficulty in grappling with the expanding complexity of tax legislation. We clearly have a significant problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the committee proposes that a broadly based task force be established to redraft the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Moreover, sufficient resources should be committed by the government to complete priority simplification within two years, and full simplification within five years. However, the committee remains cautious about well-intentioned but naive notions that the tax law can be reduced to what is commonly called plain English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the significant abuse of interest withholding tax arrangements&mdash;an issue I raised in this House a number of times in the lead up to our inquiry&mdash;the committee noted that there has been no action on the like treatment of trusts and corporations as recommended in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Follow the yellow brick road</EMPHASIS> report of March 1991. Some 2 1/2 years later, problems about withholding tax collection remain, most especially about the quality of information held and available on non-resident beneficiary trusts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Industry Economics report on this subject, commissioned by the ATO late last year as a result of my questions to senior ATO officers in public hearings, confirmed the ongoing nature of the problems, and also the considerable difficulty in arriving at definitive estimates of revenue lost. Therefore, the committee, quite properly, has recommended that the ATO review its supervision, monitoring and auditing of non-resident beneficiary trusts and improve its policy mechanisms to control abuse of interest withholding tax. In addition, we have recommended that the ATO, as a matter of priority, seeks to obtain double taxation treaties with those countries that are significant destinations for trust distributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final key area of the inquiry's attention I would like to address is the vexed question of a taxpayers charter to protect the rights of taxpayers. This is a difficult question to resolve, as there has to be a sensible balance between adequate safeguards for taxpayers against arbitrary or improper action by the ATO, and the clear obligation of the ATO to efficiently collect the revenue of the Commonwealth. Effective grievance channels for taxpayers who suffer loss or unwarranted inconvenience as a result of the actions of ATO officials are naturally essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the committee was of the view that, over and above this, a formal statement of how relations between the ATO and taxpayers should be conducted was an appropriate initiative. To this end the committee studied a number of possible models, and it was generally thought that the citizens' charter, introduced by Prime Minister John Major in the UK in July 1991, probably provided the most practicable and equitable model. We have, as a result, suggested the establishment of a taxpayers' charter by the government, taking into account the various models available as options.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a diverse range of other recommendations relating to ATO administration contained within our report, and the committee looks forward to the government's expeditious consideration of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In drawing my remarks to the close, I would like to express the gratitude of the committee and my own personal appreciation to the former Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Trevor Boucher, and the present commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody, for their excellent cooperation and frankness during the course of the inquiry. As our report correctly says in its introduction, Mr Boucher was the driving force behind the major reforms in the ATO during his term of office as commissioner from 1984 to 1993. In all, he gave nearly four decades of dedicated service to the ATO. Mr Boucher has moved on to his post as ambassador to the OECD with a fine record of achievement behind him, and the committee wishes him well in his new post. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a particular stage of the inquiry Mr Boucher was the subject of some colourful television coverage, which no doubt won plaudits among some unthinking elements of the community who thought that bagging the chief tax man was good sport and wonderful entertainment. I understand that this `good sport' caused Mr Boucher and his family some personal distress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in this place are not here, however, to be entertainers. We are here to provide for the good government of this Commonwealth and its people, with restraint and moderation in the use of the powers conferred upon us in the exercise of that responsibility. Mr Boucher and his family can be absolutely confident in the knowledge that he fulfilled his time as commissioner without a stain on his character, and the inquiry demonstrated that he was the highly able and honest senior public servant that members of this House have always held him to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A minority report by Senator Bishop is being tabled along with this majority report, and the community will make its own judgments upon the quality and relevance of that minority report, and the motivation in its presentation. I would only say that, in its discussion of capital gains tax, for instance, this is obviously a matter of tax policy and is irrelevant to our terms of reference. Any member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts could have raised particular matters of tax policy dear to our hearts, but the overwhelming majority of the committee, I think, had a clear comprehension of the terms of reference and purpose of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is deeply indebted to the public accounts committee secretariat which gave us excellent support and advice throughout the inquiry. In particular, I would like to mention the sterling work done throughout by our committee secretary, Mr Trevor Rowe, who is in the chamber with us today; tax sectional committee secretary for much of the inquiry, Ms Sue Morton; seconded Department of Finance adviser, Mr Simon Edwards, who is also with us today; and towards the end of the inquiry our other adviser, Mr Peter Dowling, from the Brisbane office of Ernst and Young. Mrs Laraine Brennan ably provided most of our secretarial support during the two years of our inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee and supporting staff all take great pride in the successful completion of our long and exhaustive inquiry. Adoption of this report resulting from the inquiry will be a watershed in the tax administration of this commonwealth, for which both the ATO and the taxpayer will certainly be the long-term beneficiaries. I join the chairman in commending the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As the former chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts I rise this morning to commend those concerned with this fine body of work which has taken, as the chairman said, some two years to come about. Basically, this report says, to coin a phrase, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. The report says that there is no need to fix the Australian Taxation Office because it `ain't broke', but it does say that following the technical modernisation undertaken some years ago under Trevor Boucher's policies, the tax office nevertheless needs legal, social and administrative updating. This report very capably highlights those areas where it needs to commence that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of people have already been thanked. I refer to Trevor Rowe, the committee secretary; Sue Morton; Simon Edwards; and, of course, Mrs Laraine Brennan. This was no small achievement by Mrs Brennan. If she had been running the Gulf War it would have been over sooner than it actually was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to express my congratulations and appreciation to a number of people for the time I served as the chair of this inquiry and the PAC, not the least of whom is the current chairman, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), who has done an excellent job in bringing this inquiry to fruition; the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred), whose efforts right across the inquiry were tireless; the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon); and the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), who I understand is still recuperating&mdash;we wish him well. I also thank Senator Watson, whose expertise on tax matters is acknowledged by all in both chambers of this parliament, and the previous member for Tangney, Mr Peter Shack, who was a very active participant in my time on the committee in the last parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report says a lot of good things and makes a lot of substantial recommendations, recommendations that will not be easy to fulfil and will take a good deal of effort by government and the tax office. Redrafting the tax law, as the honourable member for Deakin said quite rightly, is far easier said than done. But following so many of the legislative changes that have been made by this government and state governments across the 1980s and 1990s, the law has to be put into somewhat plainer English. It is no good, as the honourable member for Deakin hinted a few moments ago, for people in the community to simply wish that the tax act would shrink. It is only as big as tax practice in this country has made it. If we consider, on a bipartisan basis, how we can go about reducing the size and complexity of the tax act, every Australian will be better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of a commission says volumes for what the committee system can do in this parliament. The expertise formula, rather than the presiding over formula&mdash;that is, the commission idea rather than a board of management&mdash;is the way to go. I am very pleased that it has bipartisan support. At the last election, the coalition had a proposal not dissimilar to the idea of a board of management for the tax office. But in a bipartisan spirit the coalition members of the committee were willing to move from that and the Labor members of the committee were willing to move towards it, coming to what can be seen as not just a compromise but, more importantly, a very good, workable and constructive idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small taxation claims tribunal is really for the little people, for the ordinary Australians who have minor problems from time to time with the tax office; small matters of interpretation with small moneys involved. If government were to pursue this, it would take so much of the trauma, fear and animosity out of the tax system that it would make the life of government&mdash;and in particular the tax office&mdash;so much easier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charter of rights is something we were all quite passionate about. I am very pleased to see it in the report today. So much of what the public accounts committee has done in the last few years is specifically highlighted by the Midford Paramount episode and shows just how vulnerable the ordinary individual in our society can be to a bureaucracy. I am sure I can say, on behalf of people on both sides of the House, that it is frightening at times. A charter of rights will go quite some way to equalising that playing field. It may well be that some of these items will be implemented now by government and the tax office, only to be built on further in subsequent years, perhaps after subsequent reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charter of rights, for instance, may later need legislative backing. A future parliament may see it as warranting that. But, quite rightly, the public accounts committee has not gone so far so soon. Similarly with the issue of rulings, in the future further starch, as it were, may need to be put in the cloth of these recommendations. But it is a cautious road we must tread because any idea of disallowance procedures in this House, the Senate or both would create absolute, total and utter chaos in the taxation system and would have a very marked effect on industry, trade and commerce in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to Senator Bishop's minority report. It is highly regrettable and, as the chairman said, it does not have a good deal of substance. The sum total, to draw a close to one chapter in the life of the public accounts committee, is simply this: with the exception of one member, this report says very starkly, clearly and in a bipartisan manner that the members of the committee not only supported but revered the work of Trevor Boucher. Probably enough has now been said on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was quickly scrawling my notes I left out one member whom I meant to mention, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), who did a great job&mdash;as he always does on the public accounts committee. He is ever blunt in coming straight to the point. Believe me, Mr Deputy Speaker, with some witnesses that is a very good attribute to have on a committee. Once again, congratulations to the chairman, who did an excellent job, and to the staff and all concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on its inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office is the culmination of a lot of work from many of my colleagues on both sides of the House in this parliament and the previous one. All the congratulations have been made but, bearing in mind that Trevor Rowe&mdash;the secretary&mdash;and Simon Edwards are in the House, I take the opportunity to thank both of those gentlemen and their staff, without whom this report would not be before us today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be reasonable to say that this report was written in a climate of confusion, complexity&mdash;some complexities have been mentioned by my colleagues, whether in terms of the Income Tax Assessment Act or other things&mdash;frustration and, for some individuals, despair. That climate of despair saw the domination&mdash;perhaps arguably&mdash;of the technocrat in the Australian Taxation Office. Of necessity, therefore, the report is very extensive, technical and radical in nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have one disappointment with the report. If the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), as the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, will bear with me, the title <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An assessment of tax</EMPHASIS> is very boring. We need something in this report to draw people's attention to what we are saying. As a number of my colleagues would know, I argued very forcefully, but unsuccessfully, to title this report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PAYE</EMPHASIS>. By that I do not mean `pay as you earn' but `pray as you earn'. Unfortunately, the majority view prevailed, so I have made that comment in the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst a number of my colleagues on both sides of the House have referred to former Commissioner Boucher&mdash;he is referred to specifically in the report&mdash;congratulating him on his distinguished and lengthy service, I do not think any of us here, in the other place or in the electorate at large should lose sight of the fact that Mr Boucher oversaw a tax administration regime which, in the view of many people, at times was overly legalistic, was sometimes moralistic and, in some cases, had more than a distinct hint of bias. That is covered, in one way or another, in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I would say to the House today is that there is a substantial challenge in this report&mdash;a challenge for the government and a challenge for the new commissioner, Michael Carmody. Bearing in mind that I was not a member of this committee in the last parliament, I have to say that at the hearings that we had earlier this year with Mr Carmody, he showed that he has the right leadership to get on with the job. He is already taking up some of the report's recommendations in the context of the reinvigorated ATO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one aspect of this issue which continues to disappoint me and deeply concern me. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will recall, in the last sitting week the Speaker, in his wisdom, referred certain aspects of this committee's deliberations to the privileges committee. I know I have to be very careful because that matter is before the privileges committee. I draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, and that of the House to an article in this morning's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, which once again repeats a lot of those leaks that are the subject of the privileges committee inquiry. It seems to me that a lot of those leaks are being used for other than public accounts committee purposes&mdash;there is a political agenda, some might say, on both sides of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only comment I make is that I hope the privileges committee will see this morning's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> as yet another reflection of those very undesirable leaks and on the nature of this committee in the very important report that it has tabled this morning. I do not want to go on with some of the specific recommendations that have been mentioned by my colleagues, other than to repeat what I said earlier&mdash;this is a very strong challenge for the government and for the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I will make my comments brief; I know the House has a lot of business to deal with today. I want to make a few brief comments about this report on the Australian Taxation Office. I have come into this committee only for the last six or seven months, right at the tail end of the tax inquiry, and have been part of the sectional committee that has been conducting this inquiry. I suppose I have really been more involved in the wrap-up, the documentation and the straightening out of all the evidence that has been given over the last couple of years in order to put this report together for tabling this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the outset I would have to say that I agree with the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) in that I was not overly impressed, I am sorry to say to the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), with the name of the report. I will go further in agreeing with the honourable member for Groom. We believe the name should have been `pray as you earn', but in my interpretation the word `pray' should have been spelt p-r-e-y. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took a great deal of interest in getting on this committee and the sectional committee that was finalising the inquiry into the tax office. I did not come on to the committee carrying any baggage from anywhere else; it was purely out of interest in seeing whether there was any possible way that this parliament could make the process in relation to taxation and the understanding of that process in this country much simpler than it is. It was certainly heartening to see that the recommendation for redrafting the tax act got widespread support. The act has been in existence for almost 60 years. Surely it is incumbent upon this government now&mdash;whether we can do it in modern day, understandable language or not&mdash;to attempt to redraft the act. We should not just sit back and say, `We cannot do it, we cannot simplify it, we cannot make it more understandable'. We certainly must try. We are in the 1990s, not in the 1960s. It is also timely with the recommendations that are coming out of this report, as far as the restructuring of the tax office is concerned, that we are bringing it into the 1990s with the structure of the elected commissioners and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the more controversial aspect of the report that is being alluded to this morning is that of rulings. We have a dissenting report in the back of this document which went further than the committee was prepared to go. Having come from local government, I am afraid that I believe in the committee system where we should thrash these things out thoroughly and reach a point where we generally agree on what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, when I picked up the report yesterday and read the relevant recommendation on rulings&mdash;that is, tabling public rulings within five sitting days after their publication&mdash;I found that it happens to be recommendation 6.66, which we all know is the devil's number. It will be interesting to see whether that generates more accountability and transparency, as far as those rulings are concerned, with the Commissioner of Taxation. I support that point. It is going to be interesting to watch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly will be watching to see the effect that that recommendation has in trying to gain more accountability and transparency as far as the commissioner is concerned. If, down the line, that recommendation does not achieve the committee's perceived goal, then someone, whether it is this committee or another committee of this parliament, should revisit that aspect. The people of Australia are demanding that that be the case. We have attempted to address it in this report. If this recommendation, if taken up by the government, does not achieve that goal, then that particular area of the report will need to be revisited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small taxation claims tribunal and the charter of rights are very important recommendations and aspects of this report. I think it is bringing it a long way. I think the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch), in his comments, alluded to the fact that when people are dealing with government and government departments and get into legal wranglings, it is absolutely awesome. So many people walk away and say, `I cannot afford to take on the tax office; I will just put up, shut up and cop the penalty and do whatever'&mdash;whether they believe they are right or not. At least now if the government takes up these recommendations there may be an area where the little fellow, the small person out there in the community, can pursue his rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the short period I have been involved in this committee and particularly the sectional committee, I acknowledge the work of the staff&mdash;Trevor Rowe, Simon Edwards, Sue Morton, Ms Skinner and Mrs Brennan. They have put in long hours. They have put up with what could be termed some pedantic behaviour by all of us on the committee in relation to what we were trying to do. They have been very patient and I think that they have done an excellent job. We have spent some long hours putting the report together to get it tabled today and I think it is important that we all recognise the input from these people. Putting up with the 17th and 18th Joint Statutory Committee of Public Accounts, they will probably go down in history for their patience and consideration involved. In closing, I commend this report to the government. As, I think, the honourable member for Groom said, the challenge is now before the government to take up the recommendations contained in this report and to do something about improving the whole area of taxation right across the Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The first report which I have tabled deals with the redevelopment of the CSIRO Ian Clunies Ross laboratory complex at Prospect, New South Wales. It is proposed to relocate staff of the Division of Animal Health from the McMaster laboratory, Glebe, and staff of the Division of Animal Production at the poultry research unit at North Ryde to Prospect. It is also proposed to provide upgraded research facilities for existing staff of the Division of Animal Production at the Prospect site.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The McMaster Laboratory at the University of Sydney, Glebe, is occupied under permissive occupancy and needs to be vacated as soon as possible after June 1994. CSIRO considered several options before coming to the conclusion that the McMaster Laboratory should relocate to the site at Prospect. At the public hearing, the committee was advised that relocation of the McMaster activities to Prospect is in the national interest in terms of the research synergy between McMaster and Prospect programs and is in a metropolitan location appropriate to research outputs for the manufacturing sector. Relocation of the poultry facilities from North Ryde to Prospect was examined by the committee in 1991 and endorsed in its report to parliament in March 1992. The committee was advised that coordination of the move within this project will minimise costs and overcome potential cost penalties of a separate development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prospect site contains 41 major and minor buildings, many of which have reached the end of their useful life. Working conditions are cramped and the dated design of some buildings has made animal handling labour intensive. At the public hearing the committee was advised of the inter-institutional links between CSIRO and the University of Western Sydney, Nepean. The committee commends the CSIRO on these links and believes that these will be strengthened once library facilities at Prospect are extended, thus providing access to a greater range of research material. The committee was also advised that the Wool Research and Development Corporation has a 100 per cent equity in the land at Prospect. The committee believes that the government should give consideration to transferring this equity in the site at  Prospect to CSIRO. The estimated cost of the proposal at August 1992 prices is $11.6 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report which I have tabled&mdash;the committee's fifth for 1993&mdash;deals with the proposed rationalisation of inner Melbourne accommodation for the Department of Defence. The committee has recommended that the work, estimated to cost $27 million, should proceed. The Department of Defence proposes to rationalise its activities in the inner Melbourne area. This will affect premises on St Kilda Road which are currently leased. Some personnel will remain in the inner Melbourne area. Others will be relocated to, for example, RAAF Williams&mdash;another proposal being examined by the committee, as you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will therefore be a surplus of leased accommodation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various studies have determined that by July 1996 there will be 2,379&mdash;I do not know why it is not 2,380&mdash;Defence personnel in the inner Melbourne area. Existing leased premises would require substantial refurbishment to bring them up to modern office standards. Furthermore, if Defence were to remain in these buildings, substantial recurrent expenditure on rent and running costs would be incurred. Defence believes that most of these personnel could be accommodated at Victoria Barracks, provided the buildings within the barracks precinct are upgraded to a standard consistent with modern office accommodation. That is what the RIMA project is all about&mdash;the refurbishment of buildings at Victoria Barracks&mdash;and the committee has concluded that existing buildings in Victoria Barracks need to be substantially refurbished and upgraded to provide a modern and efficient office accommodation for Defence personnel. The entire Victoria Barracks precinct is listed on the register of the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence therefore commissioned the preparation of a conservation and management plan which concluded that there is no reason why any of the significant buildings cannot be adapted for re-use provided a number of guidelines are followed. Defence was also required to inform the Australian Heritage Commission of any proposed action and to give the commission a reasonable opportunity to consider it. Defence did not formally advise the commission of the action proposed until shortly before the committee's public hearing. The commission was therefore unable to give full consideration to what is being proposed within the time frame required for submissions to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally the committee expects proponent departments or agencies to obtain environmental or heritage clearances for projects before they are referred to it for consideration. This was not possible in this particular instance because the proposal is in the pre-schematic design stage. The commission acknowledged that Defence has the best track record of all departments in protecting its National Estate assets. Defence also gave an unequivocal assurance that the committee will be involved in the management process to ensure that heritage matters are taken fully into account during the detailed design process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the most significant gift a nation can give to anybody is the gift of citizenship. There are few things a nation can do which can supply a recognition, an acknowledgment, to people equally, no matter what their background or country of origin. We cannot do it in money, we cannot do it in the amount of land they own, but we can acknowledge people who come to Australia by granting them without fear or favour citizenship and equal rights in this great nation. I regret that in the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill we see flawed thinking on the part of the government as it approaches this great subject. The subject of citizenship should encompass, I believe, something of the character and attitudes of a person who becomes part of this great nation and should also deal with the legal obligations and background of changing nationality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government has not paid attention to the great requirements necessary in granting citizenship. If one looks at the government's administration over the past 10 years and the administration of citizenship and its immigration policies, one would have to form the view that the government does not care. Minimum standards, preferences rather than commitments, are the government's objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changed citizenship oath is quite a meaningless little oath. In fact, it is the most meaningless oath amongst all nations. I put to the House that there is not a statement any other nation requires of new citizens which is so weak in its commitment and its statement of character of an Australian citizen. I will read it for the benefit of the House. It states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a wishy-washy statement by any standards. I will read for the benefit of the House and for the packed galleries the statements other countries&mdash;some of them deadbeat countries we would not want to join, others some of the great leaders of the freedoms of this world&mdash;require of people becoming citizens. Nobody offers such a weak commitment as Australia. We are one of the few remaining great immigration nations; people are queuing in their millions to come here. Each year we have 1 1/2 million people applying to come here permanently, and we have absolutely millions of visitors, and we say, `You do not have to make much of a commitment. We will make it easy for you. Just slip in. We do not require any acknowledgment really of our head of state'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go through the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe) for the benefit of the House to find out what he thinks about this because I am sure that, by trying to divine his mind and understand what he is driving at, we will gain a clearer picture of what the government is seeking to do. The parliamentary secretary said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past year, the government has sought to promote community discussion of issues relating to our national identity.</PARA>
<PARA>That is shorthand for, `We raised the republic issue'. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) went off around the nation saying that we needed to be a republic. That was the biggest fizzer of all time. The public are now asking who is doing this. The Governor-General himself, who lead the Australian Labor Party when in opposition and was a key figure in the Australian Labor Party, has questioned the value of a republic, asking, `If it's not broke, why fix it? We have the great freedoms and the great opportunities as a nation. Why do you want to shove a republic on Australians?'. Yet, in the second paragraph of the second reading speech, the parliamentary secretary said that we have had this discussion and the government now thinks that we have to change our oath of citizenship based on the promotion of community discussion. That reflects the single-mindedness of the Prime Minister trying to swing in on Australians the thing that Australians are rejecting. He has lost the argument. John Brown and David Hill are saying that the Prime Minister has blown it&mdash;`There'll be no republic. He's blown the issue'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing that caught my attention was the parliamentary secretary's statement that the preamble in the bill makes a clear statement that `citizenship involves both rights and obligations'. This is the greatest hire-purchase agreement of all time. Hidden behind a weak pledge is a statement in the Australian Citizenship Act. No nation does that. How can people be asked to accept citizenship sight unseen? There is no instruction, requirement or anything which acknowledges what it means to be an Australian citizen; but here in the act is the pledge on which the minister places so much emphasis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That pledge refers to members of the Australian community and says that citizenship is a common bond involving reciprocal rights and obligations for uniting all Australians, while respecting their diversity and that persons granted Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and accept these obligations by pledging loyalty. There then follow four items. Why is that not in the oath itself? Why is it hidden? This is a shonky deal like some of those deals out in western Sydney where one signs an incomprehensible contract to buy a house, only to find that one has signed one's life, money and future away. If we are proud of it, why is it hidden? For goodness sake, if it is the greatest gift we can give anybody coming to a nation, should we not also be proud of it; or is there another agenda?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we trying to run this nation by accommodating in the citizenship act the views of all those migrants that come here? Are migrants the only group that we consult in this process? Surely the rest of Australia needs to have a say. Surely the rest of Australia deserves to have a comment on the commitment, involvement, and pledge of citizenship. Surely the rest of Australia deserves a comment on the commitment, not the preference, of citizenship; how one stands before the laws; and how one shares both the rights, responsibilities and benefits of citizenship. What about asking the other Aussies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a hire-purchase agreement set up to confuse somebody. This is a proud statement of our nation. I reject the concept put forward by the minister that, because there is a pledge, it does not matter what the oath says. Further in the speech, the parliamentary secretary states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the multicultural society it is proper that the pledge of commitment be one which will be equally meaningful to all our people.</PARA>
<PARA>Whom did the government ask? How did the government find out whether it is meaningful? I know the way in which these things are done: someone runs around the ethnic leaders and asks, `Do you agree with this? If you agree with this, we won't consult anybody else. We won't have a debate in the community about it. The Prime Minister is running the republican thing. We will pull the Queen out of it and change the oath of commitment'. There is no real commitment to the head of state. It just says, `We acknowledge it's a democracy and we think that a democracy is a good idea'. There is no need to make a commitment to promote it or stand by it in times of trouble&mdash;there is nothing like that. It is simply, `Yes, of course, I respect it'. Who does not respect a democracy or free ideals? This is meaningless garbage:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the multicultural society we are, it is proper that the pledge of commitment be one which will be equally meaningful to all our people.</PARA>
<PARA>Whom did the government run this past? Is this the result of the Prime Minister's judgment of who ought to have a proper commitment&mdash;`I'm a Catholic' or `I'm Irish'? Is that the way it is done? This gives great comfort to the bigots in the system. Here we are building into our citizenship process the comforts that the Prime Minister gives to bigotry in his statement about why he thinks we should be a republic. That is the reason for the change&mdash;nothing more. What a spurious reason for playing with this greatest gift we can give to any person coming from overseas. The parliamentary secretary goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To reinforce this commitment to national identity, we must continue to develop a special Australian identity. We need strong national identity to give us more strength of purpose. We need it abroad to leave no-one in any doubt about who we are and what we stand for.</PARA>
<PARA>Why adopt then the most meaningless pledge in the world? That is a lack of understanding of identity. It shows a lack of commitment. It shows a lack of knowledge of where Australia has come from and where Australia is going. It epitomises the completely lost attitude of every member of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is playing games with Mabo and the republic while people out there are dying. There are kids without homes and people without jobs but the government does not deal with the hard issues. The government's failure to deal with the hard issues, alas, has become one of the things that we need to accept as our identity so that we know who we are in the world. I reject that. It is spurious logic and it lack ideals and commitment. It is absolutely spurious&mdash;a false premise based on a false supposition that Australia needs to become a republic. Then the parliamentary secretary goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is of the view that the process of nation building is enhanced by reinforcing the notion of an `Australian' citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA>Although I have searched the bill and the pledge to find anything particularly Australian, the government still claims that it is particularly Australian. Then the parliamentary secretary goes on with this huge leap of logic which says that this process of nation building is `reinforcing the notion of an Australian citizenship'. I do not see any nation building going on. Can the government tell me where it is? Can the government tell me one part of Australia where nation building is going on? Today, because there are no ideals or commitment from the Prime Minister or any of his cabinet, we have the destruction of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the need to reinforce the concept of Australian citizenship; but it is sheer bunkum and hypocrisy for the government to say that it is based on the fact that we are building a nation. The government could not care less about what is happening out there. It could not care less about the unemployed or the families. The government could not care less about the destruction it has created and continues to create while the Prime Minister worries about his teak tables in the Lodge or whether the chairs are the right design, whether they are original or whether they are a copy from some mate of his in Sydney that he has done business with over a long period of time. What does this have to do with citizenship? For that matter, what does this have to do with leadership? In his speech on Australian citizenship, the parliamentary secretary goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some residents are reluctant to apply for citizenship partly because they do not see the present oath or affirmation as being adequately Australian in character.</PARA>
<PARA>What does that mean? Again we come to the Irish, the Catholic and the Queen&mdash;that is what that means. If we look at the oaths of other nations&mdash;the commitment of those nations who have supplied the great flow of migrants&mdash;we see really meaningful oaths and pledges. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), who is at the table, has not read it and would not know. He does not have the brains or the ability to go out and do it; but he is prepared to let it run right over the top of him and accept blindly the Prime Minister's notional concept of the character of Australia. The honourable member is prepared to accept it blindly and willy-nilly. Finally, on the second last page, the parliamentary secretary states that this pledge:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . also reflects a sense of national identity that can be readily identified with by citizens of Australia, not just applicants for citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where the government consulted. Who can identify with this? If this pledge were taken around the streets, to senior citizens, the RSLs, the P&amp;Cs and if one asked whether it was a fair statement about what Australians believe, one would get a big `No', because those people do not believe in this. This satisfied the ethnic leaders of Australia. It did not satisfy the average Aussie, and it is our citizenship we are giving away, it is our prized possession. It is the people's right to understand the commitment to citizenship of people coming to Australia. Yet the minister says it must be the applicants who are satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not disagree with discussion and consultation with applicants but, as Australians, our citizenship is a gift to those coming here. I have dealt with the parliamentary secretary's speech. What rubbish! There is no focus and no commitment. Weakness is mistaken for tolerance in the airy-fairyness of this debate. The wish to please overrides any commonsense to change Australian citizenship. I do not believe that there is an Australian person who, after honestly assessing the changes we are making here, would agree with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the international context, what we are doing is even more frightening. I will read to the House some of the international commitments. The Austrian oath states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pledge that I will belong to the Republic of Austria as a faithful citizen, that I will always conscientiously observe the laws and that I refrain from anything which would be detrimental to the interests and the reputation of the Republic.</PARA>
<PARA>It is no longer than the Australian pledge, oath, or whatever we call it, but it has substance and a commitment from the people taking the oath that they will conscientiously observe the laws; that they believe the nation has gone through a process of law making that is worth while and that they can identify with; and they will not do anything detrimental to the interests of that nation. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as well as to fulfil conscientiously my duties as a Greek citizen.</PARA>
<PARA>That is good stuff. Then I come to the best of the lot, the United States, the freest nation on earth by anyone's measures. It is the freest nation on earth, judged by the United Nations or any other group that we want to wheel out. The oath of the United States of America states:</PARA>

<PARA>There is an oath that means commitment. That is not preference; that is not seeking to appease the ethnic communities of Australia; that is not kowtowing to an exaggerated understanding of multiculturalism. It is really seeking a commitment from people that come to Australia. We say, `Look, we are all one. We want you to share in this. This is a commitment we expect of you because it is our home. It is our nation'. We cannot do anything better or be more welcoming than to open our front door and say, `Come into our home and be part of our family'. This is the process that is going on here; it is a people thing. `We want you to like us, and we like you. In this process we know that you need to make a commitment. We will honour your commitment as a citizen of this nation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to about 10 local government bodies around Australia because they administer citizenship oaths.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak today on this most important issue, the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill. A decision to change one's citizenship is taken with careful, considered thought and great seriousness. It is, in fact, an act of courage that one becomes a citizen of a nation by choice rather than by birth. It is an act which requires great courage. Millions of people have come to our shores from over 150 other nations around the world. They have come here willingly. They have sought Australia as a destination. They have desired to stay, to accept our culture, and to make themselves a part of our nation and of our lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those millions of immigrants from over 150 countries have changed the nature inevitably and irrevocably of this great nation. We are not what we were 200, 100 or 50 years ago, and we will be different again tomorrow. In great part I think that is undoubtedly so because of the contribution that is made to our continuing developing culture by new citizens. So the act of citizenship is one which is not taken lightly by those who come here and ask to become one of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask honourable members to think carefully and to put themselves in the shoes of the person who comes to Australia as an immigrant. We should remember that those immigrants have enjoyed birth in another country. Their heritage sometimes goes back not just for generations but for centuries, sometimes many centuries. They have a heritage and a commitment to that country, to that culture, to that way of life, to their religion, to their race, to their creeds and their morals&mdash;to all that goes together to make them individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In giving thought to becoming an Australian citizen, one must surely go through a great deal of questioning. Some 19 years ago when I made that decision and stood in front of a town clerk of the city of Berwick and pledged allegiance to the Queen of Australia, it was with a great deal of nervousness. In my own heart I wondered whether I needed to give up my heritage, forget my own background and deny my roots in order to become a part of this new nation&mdash;to become a citizen by choice rather than by an accident of birth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over and over again I tell my new citizens at citizenship ceremonies all over the electorate of La Trobe that they need not fear because in Australia we have adopted a welcoming stance to people from all cultures, all religions and all races. We ask only that they make a commitment to Australia; that they themselves wish to be a part of this nation; that they wish to observe our laws and in general our customs; and that they truly integrate themselves within our society to participate to the fullest extent in all the activities that help make us a community of people. Foremost in the message that I give my new citizens is the message that, while Australia has a responsibility now to them, they likewise  have a great responsibility to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly in this country we talk about rights. I am a person who fights very hard for rights. Undoubtedly later this day I will wind up in debate, perhaps argument, with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) over the issue of rights. In that instance it will be in regard to the right of individuals to not belong to associations as well as the right of individuals to belong to associations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance we are talking about responsibility. There are all sorts of rights that we talk about, are there not? Today we talk about Aboriginal rights&mdash;we will debate that in this place very shortly&mdash;about women's rights, about children's rights and about animal rights. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that very seldom do we hear our leaders, our government, our officials or our bureaucracy talk about responsibilities. This comes to the crux of the argument with respect to this legislation. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe), in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's view is that there is strong and growing support for ensuring that our national symbols effectively express our distinctive identity.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where that strong and growing support is. In particular, I do not know what national symbols he is talking about. Is it our flower? Is it our bird? Is it our animal? Is it our flag? Perhaps it is our flag because I recall that our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) went to Indonesia in 1992 and told the Indonesians that we would change the flag. He said, `We will give you a new one because we do not like the one we have'. At the same time he took the opportunity to dump on our head of state, the Queen. He came back to Australia, and there was a huge uproar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Have honourable members noticed that recently the Prime Minister has quit talking about changing our flag as a symbol of our nation? It is no longer appropriate to talk about it. Do honourable members know why? He no longer talks about it because opinion poll after opinion poll tells him that Australians do not want to change their flag. Yes, there are some who would like to change our flag. There are a few. But the very clear majority wish to retain this national symbol which has been ours since federation and parts of which were ours dating back to the early 1850s. That is a national symbol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the oath of allegiance too is a national symbol, but I do not recall the government going out and canvassing the nation, the nation's citizens or the nation's citizens-to-be about the oath of citizenship or a preamble to the act. I do not remember that at all; in fact, I am quite confident it did not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this place we are now debating a bill to amend the Citizenship Act because the government decided it wanted a new oath. It wants to change one of our national symbols, and without proper debate in the community. Thank goodness this bill is not under the guillotine in this place. Just for a change it is nice to be able to debate the issue, at least in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 October 1993, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> reported the statement of our new oath of allegiance in the context of discussions that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> had had with the poet Les Murray. It is my understanding that it was the understanding of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> that our new oath came from words which were written as a poem by Mr Murray. Just to put things in context, I read the new oath:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From this time forward under God,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in the case of the oath, and without in the case of an affirmation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose rights and liberties I respect, and</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under God from this time forward I am part of the Australian people. I share their democracy and their freedom. I obey their laws. I will never despise their custom or their faith and I expect Australia to be loyal to me.</PARA>
<PARA>Speaking on ABC radio, evidently, on 1 October, Mr Murray said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My sorrow is only that they left out those last two things that I was trying to get said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end it's their business. It just sounds a bit more bureaucratic than I wrote it, but they didn't guarantee I would be providing something set in cast iron that they had to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mine was a bit more daring. It put the citizen above the Government and made the Government into our servants and it expected Australia will be loyal to us.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not a bad idea, is it&mdash;that we expect Australia to be loyal to us? At the end of the day I do not mind whether we pledge allegiance to the Queen of Australia or whether we pledge allegiance to Australia. Some of my colleagues think differently. It does not particularly worry me. The Queen is our Queen and is the head of state and will remain so unless the government, by the will of the people through referendum, changes our constitutional arrangement. I doubt that that will happen at any time in the near or medium future. But in any case it does not worry me. I am quite happy for people to swear allegiance to Australia. It is a concept that I can well and truly cope with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing I object to in this oath is the fact that it lacks any sense of responsibility on the part of citizens towards their fellow citizens, towards their communities, towards their states and towards their government. No responsibility is taken by anyone for this act. As my colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) just said, the oath does not even require one to state one's name. It is an anonymous pledge of loyalty to Australia&mdash;`I will be loyal'. I think we need to go further than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should rethink this pledge. I think the solid, demonstrated voice of opposition to proceeding with this legislation ought to give the government cause to think again. Surely we can come together and agree, as we do on many things in this place and in committees outside these four walls. Surely we can come together and agree on a new oath that we all find acceptable and desirable. Surely we can come up with some words that add a sense of responsibility for one's actions and the responsibility that one takes when one becomes a citizen of Australia, because there are parts of our culture, parts of our ethos which we rightly insist that new citizens join and share. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express some grave concerns about the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill which, as we all know, is designed to change the Australian Citizenship Act to incorporate a preamble and to introduce a new form of commitment to Australia for people who are becoming citizens of Australia, for example, through naturalisation. In relation to the points that concern me, I must say that I do not just rely on my experience as an Australian. I have asked a lot of people from all walks of life in my electorate for their opinions on this issue and I have also asked people who have been through naturalisation ceremonies and who came from other countries. I hope that I am able to give a fairly broad basis of opinion. Hopefully, I can persuade the government to think again, although I suspect that it is a forlorn hope to get this government to think again on an issue such as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing I would like to say is that I find it very sad that Australian politics today has reached a point where a matter as fundamental as the commitment that people make to their country cannot be resolved by all parties and an agreement reached. I think that is sad. As one of the members of this parliament, I have to therefore say I must be partly responsible for that. I am not ducking, in any way, the responsibility that I must have as one of the members of this parliament. I think, however, that it is fair for me to say that a lot of the problems attendant to this issue and other major issues in Australia stem from the way in which the Keating government has been running Australia, making decisions and manipulating people's views and policies. In that sense, many Australians feel an enormous amount of distrust and concern and a betrayal at the way in which the current government&mdash;when we consider the terms of Mr Hawke and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;has been in control and has been stewards of Australia's interests for more than a decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people say to me in relation to this proposal that it seems odd and strange that the government seems to want to make a change to the way in which people embrace Australian citizenship ahead of the resolution of other items that have been placed on the agenda by the Prime Minister. I refer of course to the issue of republicanism, which is not yet resolved, which is in its early days of discussion and which already has seen the government, in its own way, attempting to manipulate the issue to its advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People ask me why we are being asked to agree to legislation on this issue when more fundamental issues about Australia have not yet been resolved. Thankfully, the issue of the republic will be resolved by a referendum. I suspect that if the constitution did not protect us in that regard there is no way that the Prime Minister would acknowledge that there will be a referendum. I believe he concedes reluctantly that there has to be a referendum. Thank goodness for the foresight of the fathers of Federation in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is odd that a fundamental issue, such as the republican issue, placed on the agenda by the government is not anywhere near being resolved; yet this legislation, in my view and in that of many others, is a logical consequence and outcome of the resolution of that most important issue. For my part, the constitutional monarchy&mdash;the system under which this nation operates now and has for many years&mdash;despite its imperfections, is by far the most proven and best system that any democracy can have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, for one, welcome debate on any changes put forward, but I feel very strongly that no case has been made to support the abandonment of the constitutional monarchy and its safeguards, checks and balances, which to me are more important than the arguments put forward by the Prime Minister, who attempts to convert it into an argument about the relevance of royalty to Australia. It is much more than that. It goes much deeper than that. We should be concerned about the checks and balances that protect our nation and control the parliament and the executive and ensure proper accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a privilege to hear the contribution from the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). How unique it is to hear a person who was an American citizen talk about these issues as a very true and committed Australian. We are very proud indeed to have the honourable member on our side of the House&mdash;as I am sure all honourable members are very pleased and proud to have him in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been an admirer of American democracy for a long while. When I see Americans celebrating an important event and pledging loyalty to their country, I sometimes feel that they do it with more vigour than Australians. I wonder why that is. I think perhaps it is a characteristic of Australians that we do not sing easily&mdash;maybe it is because we all sing as badly as I do! But the fact is that we are not as expressive as other nationalities, especially Americans. When Americans participate in public ceremonies about their country one cannot help but feel that they really do love their country. They show it, which I think is very good. I would like to think that perhaps one day Australians will break down their inhibitions and be a bit more expressive and forceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why a proposal to change the oath or affirmation, which this bill proposes to do, and convert it into a simple pledge, quite frankly, worries me. I was going to say that it offends me, but I think that is an overstatement; it worries me more than it offends me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe an oath or an affirmation of allegiance to one's country has a stronger message, a stronger personal commitment, than a mere pledge. As a lawyer, I do not want to get into legalistic argument as to what a pledge really means in contrast to an oath or an affirmation. Rather, I would like to refer to the customs of our nation. When people have to go to court and give evidence they are required to give that evidence on oath or by affirmation. In certain committees of the parliament people giving evidence are frequently required to do so on oath or by affirmation. In that sense, I feel that it is part of Australian tradition and when someone says something on oath or by affirmation it has very deep and meaningful connotations, with repercussions that can provide the basis for a criminal charge for perjury, for example, which is a very serious offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see the same degree of seriousness and commitment in the words of this bill as I feel exist in relation to the oath or the affirmation. To me, to simply say `I pledge', whilst it is important, does not have the same effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My other point I think is similar to one made by the honourable member for La Trobe. When we look at the proposed pledge, we see that it does not in any way indicate an absolute commitment, which I think citizens of Australia should make to their country. The words in the schedule state that from this time forward, under God, `I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people'. I think any new form of words should contain a commitment; an absolute commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I respect very much the people who have come from other countries&mdash;my father did and I am very proud of his background and my heritage. Notwithstanding that, I think when people do take on citizenship it is a privilege, it is something that they can be very proud of. I think it is right and proper that in doing that they should make a commitment, an absolute commitment, and not leave unsaid&mdash;as I suspect the words in the schedule have been deliberately drafted to leave unsaid&mdash;the unresolved question of dual citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to many of my constituents who have not become Australian citizens yet who, in my view, are very good citizens of Australia. For example, some people from Holland find it very difficult to enter into an oath or affirmation of allegiance because of their strong ties to their old country and indeed to its constitutional system, including the royal family. But in discussions with them, I believe their arguments cannot be sustained&mdash;particularly if the form of oath or affirmation that they are offered is one that does not in any way diminish or depreciate their own origins or background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to have seen included in an appropriate form of oath or affirmation an acknowledgment of the importance to these people of their previous nationality and country, and the acknowledgment and right of these people to continue to feel very proud about that. These people could then say that, having experienced the opportunity to be part of this democracy&mdash;a part of this country&mdash;they want to be citizens of Australia, absolutely committed to Australia. It could be made absolutely clear in that context that that is the basis on which they take up citizenship. I think perhaps that is one of the things which could have been incorporated in a proposed amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make another rather interesting point. In his second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe) says in one paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a parliamentary democracy committed to providing equality before the law, freedom of the individual, freedom of speech and religion, equality between men and women and equality of opportunity for all.</PARA>
<PARA>I embrace and support all of those valuable statements. However, if we look at the form of pledge that the legislation, if enacted, will bring into law, nowhere do we see those words. Why is that the case? We all know that the second reading speech will soon be forgotten. It certainly will not be read at naturalisation ceremonies throughout Australia in the future. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the government did not include in the form of words the actual words that characterise Australia. In my case, I would argue that as I make the oath or affirmation of loyalty I make an oath to support</PARA>
<PARA>equality, freedom, freedom of speech and religion, equality between men and women and equality of opportunity for all. I think that those words or similar words should be incorporated in an appropriate, contemporary form of commitment when one becomes a naturalised citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am troubled&mdash;I know that other speakers for the coalition have touched on this&mdash;by some aspects of the citizenship law anyway. I think that it is more than overdue that these provisions be urgently reviewed. I briefly give one example of one of the nonsenses that exist in the law at the moment. I have a constituent who came to Australia from Scotland at the age of four with his parents, brothers and sisters. The constituent attended school and university in Australia and qualified as an engineer from Melbourne University. His parents are naturalised citizens of Australia. His brothers and sisters are naturalised. After working in Australia following graduation, he went overseas, as many young professional Australians do, to gain experience and knowledge and has worked for several years in other countries&mdash;at times involved in programs that are, I think, associated with United Nations operations in Third World countries&mdash;gaining skills and also imparting skills to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because he has been working overseas for more than five years, he apparently is no longer entitled to a permanent entrance visa to come back to Australia, which he has always done at least once or twice a year for holidays and to spend time with his family. He has been shocked, and so too has his family, to find that whenever he wishes to come to Australia, where he has lived since the age of four&mdash;he is now nearly 30&mdash;he has to make special application for a visa to come back in. At a couple of interviews that he has had, I believe that he has been more or less told that he should not regard any future application for a visa as something that would normally be granted forthwith; that he is now in a position where he is almost regarded as a foreigner&mdash;in fact, he is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussions with this young constituent and his family, the constituent said, `The only reason I am not naturalised is that I never thought about it, having been brought up in Australia and regarding myself as an Australian. It is only now that I realise that I should have been naturalised before I embarked on my work and career overseas. I would like to become naturalised'. The point is that, to become naturalised, he has to apply to the minister, who has a discretion under section 13 of the act to consider applications by people for citizenship who have not lived continuously in Australia for, I think, one year out of the last two. The minister has the power to grant the right to take on citizenship to such people provided certain criteria are established. One is that the person has a commitment to Australia. Obviously, from what I have said, how could we not accept that this person, with his family involvement and all the rest, does not have a commitment to Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, one of the clauses in the policy&mdash;and in the act as well, I think&mdash;says that the person has to convince the minister that the work done overseas is of importance and significance to Australia. There is a High Court decision that virtually says that, because of the policy that was put down by a minister for immigration in 1967, that contribution has to be at the highest level, such as at the diplomatic level. That is nonsense. If a young Australian working overseas&mdash;building dams and helping Third World countries&mdash;gaining experience, skills and contacts is regarded as not making a significant contribution to Australia, for the life of me, I wonder what on earth has gone wrong with Australia. Our young Australians are the ones we should be encouraging to get out, have a go, learn things about other nations, find things, find new markets and come back and help this country grow. That aspect of the constituent's problem does not appear to be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked the minister for an urgent deputation so that the family can hopefully have a citizenship ceremony for their son by Christmas, which will also celebrate their 70th birthdays and their 25th year in Australia. To date, I have not heard from the minister whether he will see me so that I can at least put to him that the sort of service and experience of this young Australian, who wants to formalise his Australian citizenship by being naturalised, is of significant importance to this nation. One does not have to be a high commissioner, a diplomat or a general to make a significant contribution to his or her nation. Contributions come from a lot of areas on a lot of levels. I am hoping that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will support me in my request to see the minister. I hope that I can persuade the minister. For God's sake, let this young Australian becomes naturalised. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Change for the sake of change by those seeking to find a new identity can, and perhaps will, create unpopular division within our community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To attempt to push some sort of new world idea onto those choosing to gain the much valued Australian citizenship by reference to our current style or system of government is bizarre in the extreme. In his presentation to the Senate, Senator Bolkus remarked that the Queen remains a central point of our constitutional arrangements; yet to persist with this self-denial process is bordering on the extreme.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refute the suggestion that the new oath is strong in emotion and passionate about our nation. If we are to change, then I strongly recommend that we review the wording to not only provide allegiance to our system of government, but also show some sort of passionate declaration for Australia.

It may be argued that it is insufficient in its strength in declaring allegiance, and I tend to agree with that point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion is to replace the oath or affirmation of allegiance with a pledge of commitment. We are either strongly declaring Australia to be our chosen nation, or we are not. Why is it that we have to weaken our pledge with some sort of wishy-washy pledge of commitment? As an example, the Americans make no apology for their system of government and they strongly state allegiance to their country. The American oath of allegiance reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, to whom or which I heretofore have been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the constitution and the laws of the United States of America against all enemies foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by law; that I will perform non-combatant service in the armed forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by law; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt what the American oath of allegiance is about.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On my honour, I promise that I will do my best, to do my duty to my God, and to the Queen of Australia, to help other people and to live by the Scout law.</PARA>
<PARA>Even the end of the standard marriage vow says, `Till death us do part'. There is passion and commitment from these pledges. There is a very big commitment in these oaths compared with what is being proposed today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 is not so much about necessary or justifiable changes to existing legislation or processes; rather, it is another item on the anti-British agenda which our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is trying to introduce with what can only be regarded as indecent haste. His cause is, of course, futile. Despite one's best endeavours, one cannot change history even if one is the Prime Minister. It is useless and dangerous to say to people that they must ignore or cast aside part of their heritage because some people would like to pretend that things had happened differently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that in a debate such as this it is important to acknowledge that some government members are also deeply concerned about their leader's agenda. Unfortunately, they have little opportunity to express their misgivings but I know that they will be supportive of the comments and attitudes expressed by members of the coalition parties and the community generally in regard to these matters. The Prime Minister and some members of his Labor government are seeking to change our national institutions and symbols despite the fact that the majority of Australians see no reason for change and are opposed to change at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First it was our national flag; then the safeguards offered by our constitutional monarchy; now the oath or affirmation of allegiance sworn or declared by new Australian citizens. There is no good reason for the government to introduce this bill at this time. These amendments are premature in that they pre-empt the outcome of a significant and ongoing community debate, a debate which will have an enormous impact on the future of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, these amendments are based on unsubstantiated assertions about supposed widespread community concern and dissatisfaction with the present requirements for, and processes involved with, the granting of Australian citizenship. But there is no hard evidence to back these claims; in fact, quite the contrary. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe) in his second reading speech tried hard to justify the need for this legislation. But he failed to come up with any reasonable explanation as to why, under current circumstances, the existing oath or affirmation should be replaced with the proposed pledge of commitment. This is hardly surprising, really. The parliamentary secretary talked about giving:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . proper recognition to the significance of Australian citizenship as a common bond which unites all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>It already has; it already does. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's view is that there is strong and growing support for ensuring that our national symbols effectively express our distinctive identity.</PARA>
<PARA>They already do. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government believes the time is right to change our citizenship law to reinforce the place of Australian citizenship as a defining element of our national identity.</PARA>
<PARA>It already is. The parliamentary secretary then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Australian Citizenship Act 1948 is principally concerned about the process of acquiring and losing citizenship. This is inadequate. The act should also contain a preamble defining the meaning which the parliament and the people of Australia accord to citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the fact that one would have thought that the Australian Citizenship Act should be principally concerned with the process of acquiring and losing citizenship&mdash;what else would it be concerned about?&mdash;if the proposed preamble is meant to define the meaning which the parliament and the people of Australia accord to citizenship, then it falls far short of its stated objective. How can one hope to properly and adequately define in a few words the freedoms, security, rights, privileges and obligations that Australian citizenship bestows and that Australian citizens enjoy. It would probably be just as appropriate to say, `I love Australia' or, `I am proud to be an Australian'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, the preamble would not be needed if the government was not so keen to change the oath of allegiance. Both the existing oath and affirmation make it clear that, to use the parliamentary secretary's words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . citizenship involves both rights and obligations, which are enshrined in the constitution and our laws.</PARA>
<PARA>I have great difficulty in accepting the premise that the proposed pledge of commitment will be any more `equally meaningful' to all Australians than the already existing oath or affirmation is already. What is more `equally meaningful' about a wishy-washy, watered-down pledge than a clear, concise and straightforward oath or affirmation? The parliamentary secretary also stated in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is one of those few countries which actually relish its diversity. Under the umbrella of an overall commitment to the nation and its uniting values and institutions, a society of great richness and variety as well as remarkable harmony has evolved.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind him, and his colleagues who are supporting this bill, that all this has occurred over a period when new Australian citizens have been required to use the existing oath. How can government members now argue it is inadequate? By the admission of the parliamentary secretary, the existing oath has obviously served, and continues to serve, its purpose well; so why change it? Later in his speech the parliamentary secretary asserted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some residents are reluctant to apply for citizenship partly because they do not see the present oath or affirmation as being adequately Australian in character.</PARA>
<PARA>What sort of a shonky, ill-founded claim is that? How many are `some'&mdash;10, 20, 100, 1,000? For that matter, how much is `partly'? If, as the parliamentary secretary admits, the present oath or affirmation is only `partly' the reason for the reluctance of this undefined number of people becoming citizens, then what does the term `partly' actually mean? Is it a major factor or a minor factor amongst numerous other unidentified considerations? Such a statement is about as profound and useful as asking, `How long is a piece of string?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the term `adequately Australian' mean? How more adequately Australian can a statement be when it requires a new citizen to swear, or, as in the case of the affirmation, solemnly and sincerely promise and declare to be faithful and bear true allegiance to our constitutional Australian head of state, and to faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil the duties of an Australian citizen? In fact, the words `Australia' and `Australian' are mentioned three times in the existing oath or affirmation and only once in the proposed pledge. How does one make something more adequately Australian by proceeding to delete two-thirds of the existing references to Australia? Furthermore, has the government considered that some who are partly deterred from applying for citizenship by the `inadequately Australian' wording of the current oath or affirmation, may in fact be significantly less in number than those who will find this new proposed pledge unacceptable? Where are the figures to back up the government's claims that more people will be satisfied with the new wording? The claim is obviously a hollow one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1984, I have represented the people of Casey in this parliament, and in that time only one person has expressed dissatisfaction about the wording of the existing oath. I have attended many citizenship ceremonies and have witnessed the pride, respect and dignity with which men and women of all ages and ethnic backgrounds repeat the words that formalise their decision to become Australian citizens. There is no doubt that it is a momentous, meaningful and significant decision. Few, if any, have taken it lightly or for the wrong reasons. The vast majority have made a considered decision. They know what they are doing and they accept what is required of them. Is the government now seriously suggesting that all these new citizens, or even a significant percentage of them, do not really mean what they say and are not taking their responsibilities seriously? Is it suggesting that they are swearing the oath or declaring the affirmation with their tongues in their cheeks or their fingers crossed behind their backs?  That is certainly not my observation or experience. Nor is it the observation or experience of one of my constituents, Mr George Mohren, who knows more about this particular matter than most people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">George Mohren happens to have been a migrant. He arrived in Australia from Germany in 1960 and became an Australian citizen in 1965. At that time, the waiting period was five years instead of two as at present. George served for 27 1/2 years with the immigration department. He spent 18 of those years with the citizenship section. During that time, George personally conferred Australian citizenship on more than 25,000 people. He processed applications for citizenship from a quarter of a million more. Following his retirement in 1987, he has maintained his interest and involvement in the citizenship process in a voluntary capacity. Over the past six years he has assisted with the organisation and conduct of hundreds of citizenship ceremonies in the shires of Lillydale and the cities of Croydon and Knox. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government first mooted its intention to alter the existing oath and affirmation, I discussed the matter with George and sought his ideas on the proposed changes. He told me that, from a personal point of view, he was not in favour of them. As recently as yesterday, I checked with him again to see whether he had altered his opinion. He had not. His opposition to the proposed changes is based on his personal belief that they are not only inappropriate, but also demonstrably unnecessary. He should know because of his significant first-hand knowledge and experience of, and direct involvement with, thousands of new Australian citizens and the processes connected with the granting of Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">George Mohren has told me that over the many years he served with the citizenship section at the immigration department, and during the six years voluntary assistance he has provided to local municipalities since his retirement, he has `only very rarely'&mdash;those are his exact words and they are worth repeating; `only very rarely'&mdash;encountered people who have had objections to the existing oath or affirmation, and the requirement to bear true allegiance to the Queen of Australia, in particular. However, in all but one of these rare cases, people who were at first apprehensive finally overcame their misgivings and took the oath or affirmation. The only one definite refusal was on religious grounds. George Mohren also told me that most of the very few people he had come across who had some difficulty in accepting this condition of citizenship happened to be of Irish descent. He emphasised that this was not in any way a criticism or slur in so far as the Irish are concerned, but simply a matter of fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that some people of Irish descent have difficulty in accepting the historical links which have resulted in the fact that the Queen of Australia is also, amongst other things, the Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is not a new problem.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his work entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The foundations of culture in Australia</EMPHASIS>, the late P.R.

<PARA>Our Prime Minister, for one, should contemplate these words very carefully. It is not appropriate or acceptable to be tempted to change something that the vast majority find inoffensive simply to cater for the few whose attitudes are influenced by events which may have occurred&mdash;or for that matter may still be occurring&mdash;in faraway places. If we fail to resist such temptations, then we are effectively inviting those who have old scores to settle to bring their prejudices with them to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot afford to make such an enormous error. We cannot, and should not, tolerate minority views based on historical dislikes of one nationality for another. Perpetuation of hatreds founded in the past contributes nothing to our nation's future. This is Australia and we are first and foremost Australian citizens. We are a multicultural nation, but that does not mean we should be anti-British, anti-Irish or anti-anything. We should simply be pro-Australian. Otherwise debates on matters of national identity degenerate into a sort of `my heritage is better than your heritage'. That is not only unacceptable, but also most unwise. We must accept that, whilst differences may enrich us, dissension will make us poorer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is paradoxical that some of those people who protest longest and loudest, albeit incorrectly, that we are still an outpost of empire, contrive to ensure that we will return to this former status by continually insisting on allowing past differences and difficulties which have existed between other nations to influence our Australian attitudes and way of life. This applies particularly in regard to the requirements for and of Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, it is alarming to find so many government members and senators speaking in support of this bill on the basis that Australians should not be required to express their allegiance to an English monarch.

There is no excuse for confusion in this regard, except that the government seems intent on creating it for its own republican purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also alarming to hear comments and arguments such as those expressed in another place by the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht), who accused the opposition of wanting to use an oath of allegiance, that is&mdash;to use the honourable senator's words&mdash;`clearly written for the 19th century'. What is so wrong with that, senator?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to the impression the government is endeavouring to create, the changes proposed in this bill have nothing to do with any real or identifiable need to change the current requirements for the granting of Australian citizenship, but everything to do with the anti-British and pro-republican views of the Prime Minister and others.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the word `historic' is often overworked but I do not think that in applying it to this meeting in our wildest imagination we could say that it was. It is a gathering of the leaders of the Asia-Pacific community, representing half the production of the world. The leaders are from the United States, China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, et cetera. This grouping is coming together at a time when we are seeing substantial growth in the Asia-Pacific area. We should recognise that it is already a more integrated area than the European Community or even NAFTA. More goods are traded within the area, one country to another, than are traded within North America or within the European Community.</PARA></TALK.START>

Already, three-quarters of our exports go to APEC countries, which are a source of two-thirds of our imports, and nine of our 10 top export markets are APEC countries. So this is obviously where we already are in terms of growth, exports and imports. So the challenge now for the APEC area is how to become more closely integrated and how we can maintain rapid growth rates, increasing the velocity of trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Seattle meeting, for which I am leaving this afternoon, will help that process. The meeting will be conducted without officials and pre-cooked communiques. The preceding ministerial meeting, which the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be attending, will set the scene for the consideration of a number of practical, new initiatives, including the establishment of a trade and investment framework which will help our trade facilitation agenda and consideration of the report of the eminent persons group, on which Neville Wran represented Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At their meeting the leaders will actually have an unprecedented opportunity to give APEC the boost to its consolidation that could only come from the engagement of the leaders of these countries and to underline the support for the multilateral trading system which has been so material to the growth of the Asia-Pacific community countries. The leaders, while we are there, will also take the opportunity to urge a successful outcome in the closing moments of the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations, to put more pressure back on France and the European countries to make the concessions that need to be made to bring the Uruguay Round to a close and to look ahead to explore the ways in which we can develop a closer sense of community in the Asia-Pacific by such things as standardisation of policies, foreign investment policies, taxation policies, food standards, professional standards&mdash;all the things that can make the velocity of trade faster and investment opportunities better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This century has been dominated by the politics and economics of Europe. This very day in the press we saw the United States Secretary of State, Mr Christopher, make clear that, if the Europeans wish to go on in a selfish way in terms of opening up market access and opportunities for the rest of the world, the United States will look more closely to APEC. This was quite a statement, because Secretary of State Christopher indicated that Europe has only two-thirds of the trade that the United States has with the APEC area and it is the APEC area which offers the greater potential for the United States in the event that Europe starts to close up its markets. In any event, Europe is growing far more slowly than is the Asia-Pacific area.</PARA>

It is Labor thinking out aloud and broadly for Australia, thinking about its long-run position in the world, not the next two, three or five years but the next 50 or 100 years&mdash;that is, developing the kinds of relationships in Asia and the kinds of structures in the Asia-Pacific which Australia can be a more natural part of than it has been to date.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The taxes to which the honourable member refers are changes which were brought in during the 1980s to repair the structure of revenue collections in Australia which, of course, had fallen into total disrepute under the administration of our predecessors&mdash;particularly the honourable member for Bennelong and his close adviser, the now Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the approaches which the government took during the 1980s was to ensure that there was a greater degree of fairness in the system, that there was a neutrality in terms of particular kinds of income and capital, and that they were essentially treated on a comparable basis so that the efforts to which so many people went to try to disguise income as capital or to rearrange their remuneration in a way in which they received non-cash benefits were essentially eliminated and the tax system was made much fairer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member asks what the cost would be of the elimination of these taxes, it is not just the amount that these taxes bring in in their own right but the extent to which they prevent avoidance and evasion in other ways. To answer the honourable member's question, over the last four years the CGT brought in an average of $482 million a year; in 1992-93 the FBT brought in $1.3 billion; and the foreign source income has brought in $60 million. We have a total there of about $1.8 billion. The abolition of these taxes, of course, would lead to much greater revenue losses than those which are indicated by these figures as we would see a return to the kind of pre-1983 habits of individuals and businesses as they tried to avoid their proper responsibilities with regard to taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the government was making these reforms, we had the support of the Leader of the Opposition. For instance, in 1987 he said on capital gains and fringe benefits, `I'd go for near uniform taxation of all forms of income'. In other words, in the mid- to late-1980s the Leader of the Opposition agreed that this was the right way to go to make the tax system fairer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we can only lament massively that the Liberal Party has now abandoned any sense of responsibility or revenue neutrality as far as its own tax policy is concerned. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that there has been a total disintegration as far as tax policy is concerned on the other side of the House. On Sunday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> program the shadow Treasurer said that it was no longer opposition policy to abolish sales tax, payroll tax and fuel excise, which honourable members will recall were the centrepiece of the changes those opposite thought were so necessary at the time of the last election. They have now decided that sales tax, payroll tax and fuel excise do not matter, even though they ranted and raved mercilessly during the election about the iniquitous nature of these three taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, intriguingly, the shadow Treasurer was totally silent on what he intended to do about company tax. The House will recall that at the time of the last election the opposition wanted to put up company tax to 42c in the dollar. When asked about this particular issue, of course, the shadow Treasurer was noticeably vague and essentially silent. We now know why he was so vague on that issue: today we learned that it is Senator Bishop's policy to get rid of the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we see the shadow Treasurer as someone who is hedging his bets. He is going to be a shadow Treasurer for all seasons&mdash;a shadow Treasurer for any old leader who happens to come along. So he has it in the back of his mind that, when Senator Bishop comes along as his leader and he has to accommodate the abolition of the fringe benefits tax and the abolition of the capital gains tax, he will need some alternative revenue source. What better than to stick to the idea of maintaining company tax at 42c, as the opposition proposed at the last election? If that policy of company tax at 42c were retained, it would raise from Australian companies $2.7 billion more than would the rate of 33c, which they now pay under this government, would raise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we have it: the shadow Treasurer just hedging his bets a bit, waiting, preparing himself for the time when Senator Bishop comes here, and knocks over the Leader of the Opposition, who no longer stands for anything anyway. He has a ready-made solution to accommodate Senator Bishop as she proposes to wreck the taxation system once again by the abolition of these very important and fair taxes.</PARA>

I heard him this morning on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> declaring, amongst other things, that the Commonwealth bill recognises the Western Australian bill as a fait accompli. He made three assertions and he is wrong in all of them. First, he said that the bill recognises that Western Australia can legally convert common law title to a statutory version under section 208 of the bill. The bill does not enable the Western Australian government to convert native title to statutory rights. In fact, there is every possibility that the Western Australian legislation will be invalid because of its likely conflict with the Racial Discrimination Act. What is more, the Western Australian bill will be clearly in conflict with clause 21 of the Commonwealth bill, which makes certain future actions impermissible to the extent that they affect native title.</PARA></TALK.START>

Secondly, the honourable member for Flinders says that, faced with this fait accompli, the Commonwealth bill introduces a retrospective law basically to get Western Australia. The honourable member is as wrong here as he is in the first instance; that is, there is no fait accompli since the Commonwealth bill does not recognise that Western Australia can validly convert native title to statutory title.

Not surprisingly, this did not attract the criticism of the honourable member for Flinders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mabo has attracted the attention of the honourable member for Flinders because it is his job to try to basically fudge the ground between the Commonwealth's principled legislation and that of Western Australia. More than a year since the High Court decision has been handed down the federal opposition still does not have a policy on Mabo. The first policy that the honourable member for Flinders produced was the government's policy, the government's draft bill.

They will find out, and the electorate will find out, whether the Liberal Party really has disavowed the extremist policies which lost it the last election.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member for Flinders and the Leader of the Opposition are any indication, it has not made any progress at all. What we are seeing, as we have all the way through, is simply a moral and political vacuum.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, the House should be aware that last week the Chinese, following discussions with Australian officials, made a very important announcement that they would drop the tariff on processed wool into China by five per cent. We consider this to be a very important first step in the revision downwards of tariffs that have made it, to date, uncompetitive for processed wool to be taken into that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision is important because it needs to be understood that it was made against a background of the Chinese government saying that it would not reduce any tariff until such time as it acceded to GATT. We, as a nation, were supporting its accession to GATT. But we were able to change the view from being reliant on accession to GATT to one in which the Chinese government was prepared to look at it in the context of the commercial opportunities between the two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following representations made by the Prime Minister to the Vice Premier of China in the middle of this year&mdash;and more recently when Madam Wu, representing the Chinese government, met with the Minister for Trade and me last month&mdash;there was an indication on the Chinese government's part that, in the context of joint ventures, it would be prepared to review the tariff level. Our approach, as a government, was  not just to address this issue from the point of view of government to government&mdash;of getting the tariff down once China got into GATT. We sought to marshall the forces of the commercial interests and to convince the Chinese that it was not just a tariff problem associated with GATT, but it was in fact an impediment as a cost input miltitating against further expansion of its textile industry. Against that background, we developed with the commercial interests in this country a delegation to go to China. That is what resulted in this very important step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very good result for this country and, as I said before, it is a first step. But Chargeurs, the company that has invested very heavily in expanded wool processing activity in Wagga, has described it as an excellent result and an important boost for the wool processing industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is good news for the wool industry. It comes on the back of very good news so far as the price of wool is concerned. We have seen the 10th consecutive week of increase in the price of wool. That comes on the back of the decision of this government&mdash;supported, I might add, by the opposition&mdash;to give certainty to the industry by announcing a new package of reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just returned from overseas where there is very strong confidence in the future of the wool industry. I am working with the growers, the processors and the international trade to ensure that there is effective promotion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very pleased to see the Industrial Relations Commission agree to an $8 increase in supplementary payments for workers on minimum award rates of pay from 1 December. This is a moderate, affordable wage increase and one which is consistent with economic growth and low inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth recording that inflation in this country at the moment is 2.2 per cent. It is there by virtue of the government's anti-inflation policies which include an incomes policy of now nearly 11 years standing and a firm but sympathetic monetary policy which understands that the twin objectives of economic policy are economic growth with the maintenance of low inflation. An $8 a week increase in supplementary payments for those on minimum award rates will be combined with the tax cuts of the day before yesterday of $8 to $10 a week for people on middle incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rest of the community will also be securing, under the decentralised wage system established by the government, wage increases, which are not of the minimum variety, of minimum award rates of pay so that middle income wage and salary earners will have wage adjustments coming through the decentralised system of enterprise bargaining and wage bargaining as well as an $8 to $10 a week tax cut. So there is an $8 to $10 a week tax cut, as provided for in the election campaign as part of the One Nation statement of tax cuts, and on top of that now is an $8 increase as a supplementary payment for those on minimum award rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A core point of the government's industrial relations policy has been to maintain the award system&mdash;to leave a safety net underpinning minimum award rates of pay so that we did not see people fall below what are now these statutory minimums. But the opposition in the last election campaign was for going for individual wage contracts, which was basically ripping up the basic award minimums, taking away the safety net and letting wage and salary earners fall through it into relative poverty. This was the opposition's policy until the nation woke up to exactly what it was putting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that our British delegates in the gallery will have heard all this before. The fact is that the game is the same in both countries in this respect. That is, there needs to be a fair go for those on minimum incomes. If we do not give them a fair go, they do not have the purchasing power to keep the economy going and, at the same time, the capacity to give those on the middle rungs of the income ranges the chance to get out and bargain, to lift productivity and share that productivity between profits and wages. If that were not happening, we would not have an inflation rate of just over two per cent with very low interest rates, with bill rates under five per cent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Richmond for his continuing interest in the development of the Australian tourism industry. The opposition will be disappointed to acknowledge that Australia is in its seventh consecutive quarter of economic growth, especially given the predictions in the past of double dip recessions which have not come true. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new survey carried out by Access Economics for the Australian Tourism Industry Association paints a very optimistic future for the Australian tourism industry, and for further signs of growing confidence in the Australian economy. This survey indicates that tourism industry operators are expecting not only improved sales and profits but, most importantly of all, stronger employment prospects. That, of course, is good news for young Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this continuing very strong growth in the Australian tourism industry is not only an increasing number of international visitors, but an improvement in domestic tourism activity. For the first eight months of this year we had a 15 per cent increase in the number of international visitors coming to Australia. In addition to that, I am advised that for the June quarter the number of visas issued by Australia's high commissions and embassies is 21 per cent higher than for the same quarter last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the fact that 10 years ago when this mob opposite left office we had only 950,000 international visitors coming to Australia each year, on these figures I would expect that, for the first time, in 1993 we will break the three million barrier. Three million international visitors will generate more than $8 billion in export earnings, and could create up to 200,000 more jobs than we had 10 years ago when those opposite left office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth has been most spectacular in the Asian region where the Prime Minister and the government have been very keen to enhance Australia's image. From countries such as Korea and Taiwan we have had a 70 per cent increase in the number of international visitors for the first eight months of this year compared with last year. From south-east Asia as a whole we have had more than 40 per cent growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be of interest to honourable members to know that on the domestic front there is very strong evidence of further growth in consumer confidence, especially when we realise that spending on tourism is considered to be discretionary expenditure by Australians. The figures which have been released today by the Bureau of Tourism Research show that in the June quarter this year we had a 16 per cent increase in travel within Australia, and a 22 per cent increase in business trips&mdash;a further sign of a healthier business economy as a result of those seven quarters of consecutive economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we look at these tourism figures, we can see that by increasing the number of international visitors we are generating more export earnings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the Auditor-General reported to this parliament in audit report No. 9. The report is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program</EMPHASIS>, a program which has been run out of the office&mdash;I say `out of the office' deliberately&mdash;of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). The first responsibility of any minister is to administer the department. As this Auditor-General's report illustrates, there has been a humiliating failure of administration in this department&mdash;and by this minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suspicion is that up to $30 million of taxpayers' money has been spent on a vote buying exercise by the Australian Labor Party. It was not motivated by public interest or community need, but by self-interest and political need. It was motivated by the desire of this minister and this government to use taxpayers' funds&mdash;the funds collected from taxpayers&mdash;to buy their way back into office at the 13 March 1993 election. This is not some charge made by the opposition; it is a  charge made by the Auditor-General, an  independent statutory officer, who has the responsibility to report to this parliament on expenditure by government and the way that proceeds. In the report brought to this parliament yesterday, the Auditor-General:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . found that the Department's administration. . . was weak:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.insufficient information was sent to the Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the objectives of the program were unclear</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the procedures for processing applications were poor&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.documentation supporting the . . . process was inadequate</PARA>
<PARA>He found there was not enough consultation. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.projects were not monitored systematically&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.certain administrative procedures left the program open to fraud and <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the program fraud control plan was out of date&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.there is poor performance information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is quite clear from the report by the independent Auditor-General that this program was not administered in any significant way, it was open to fraud, relevant documentation was missing, the objectives were unclear and the minister failed&mdash;in dereliction of her duty&mdash;to properly administer her department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a darker side, a darker side still than this hopeless administration, this pathetic performance as found by the Auditor-General. There is a darker side that indicates it may not just have been incompetence. It may have been a case of bias as well. The Auditor-General went in to have a look at this program because of allegations by Senator Baume&mdash;the then shadow minister for the arts, heritage and sport&mdash;in Senate estimates hearings and by the opposition generally, that it had been politically directed. When the Auditor-General went in to see whether or not this could be proven or disproven, he found that the relevant documents&mdash;the documents that would disclose the basis on which grants were being made&mdash;did not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen, in relation to question time, that the minister was asked a very simple question. She was asked whether or not she would disclose to the parliament the documentation that had been generated in her office in relation to the applications, the approval of applications and the grants of applications. She was asked whether she would provide to the parliament the information that the Auditor-General said was necessary for this parliament to properly discharge its duties. This minister was unable to come into this parliament and disclose that documentation. I say to the minister, `If, by the end of your reply on this matter of public importance, you have not given an unequivocal commitment to table all of those documents, there will be but one conclusion'. The conclusion will be that she has something to hide because she has done something wrong. If those documents are clear and plain and disclose, as she was maintaining, that this program was administered in the proper way, and if they disclose that this was being done on an open needs basis, there is nothing to hide from. There would be no problem whatsoever in bringing those documents in and reporting to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General was prohibited from seeing those particular documents&mdash;prohibited from reporting to the people of Australia and this parliament as to whether or not this program had been efficiently administered. So all he could do was go to the results, and I tell honourable members that the results of this particular program are deafening. The Auditor-General said that, in relation to $30 million of approvals in 1992-93, although the Labor Party held only 53 per cent of seats, it got 73 per cent of the grants&mdash;53 per cent of the seats but 73 per cent of the grants&mdash;and 66 per cent of the value of the money that was approved. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average that was given to Labor seats was $257,000. The average, over the whole of Australia, that was approved for grants to coalition seats was $141,000&mdash;a difference of $110,000 per electorate. There are only about 100,000 people in each electorate. What gives the absolute lie to the pathetic defence that was mounted by the minister was that she said, `Well, we were giving it out on only a needs basis. We were doing it only on a needs basis. The Labor electorates got more because they were more needy'. But do honourable members know who got the most money of all? It was not the safe Labor seats; the Labor marginal seats just happened to get $326,000 on average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do honourable members know what went, on average, to the Liberal marginal seats or the coalition marginal seats? It was $163,000. Think about that&mdash;$163,000. What is the difference between $163,000 to coalition marginal seats compared with $326,000 for Labor marginal seats? I will tell honourable members. It is exactly half, to the dollar. This needs based funding component just happened, to the dollar, to give $2 to every Labor marginal for every $1 to every Liberal marginal seat. Is that not an extraordinary coincidence? By the time we got through the needs basis, it just happened to be $2 to $1&mdash;exactly to the dollar even when we are talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was not allocated on the basis of deprivation. It was allocated for one base political reason: the government decided to use the taxpayers of Australia to buy itself back into office. These results speak volumes. When the Auditor-General went into how the program was actually administered, do honourable members know what he found? He found that it was not the department that was actually going through the applications and making the decisions but the minister's office. The department was not making the recommendations. All of this was being boxed up in the minister's office. Here is a finding that the Auditor-General actually made. In section 2.19 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that in the latest round of approvals the Minister's office asked for details of the electorates in which the applications were located but was not prepared to put its request in writing when asked to do so by the Department, willy nilly can only lead to speculation about the basis for the selection process.</PARA>
<PARA>I will tell honourable members what the speculation is. The  speculation is that the minister had this little cabal inside her office that had taken over the process that was asking about electorates. As the shadow minister for sport actually tabled some minutes, it was writing out to members asking them about proposals in their electorates, and classifying the electorates up the top in the case of the safe Labor seat of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). So one got this invitation to come in on the basis of the categorisation of one's electoral standing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing is to see what role the department took in this actual process. The department had only one thing to do. When the application came in the department put the application into one of three categories and then passed it over to the minister's office for approval. Category 1 was those projects which were well documented with a clearly demonstrated need; category 2 was those projects with minor deficiencies in information with a community need; and category 3 was projects lacking in relevant information for which community need was not adequately demonstrated. So if the application was well documented and there was a community need, it was category 1. If there was a community need but a minor deficiency, it was category 2. If it was lacking in relevant information, it was category 3. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those applications that lacked information in category 3 had a higher success rate than those in category 1, which were projects properly and well documented with a clearly demonstrated community need. Applications that were actually properly documented and had a community need had a nine per cent chance of success. Category 3 applications, which lacked relevant information and did not show community need, had a 13 per cent chance. One message came out of this: if people want to get something out of the minister's office, they should not document it; they have a much better chance if they have not documented it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Leader of the Opposition says, I suppose the minister's defence will be that she endorsed only the cover of the application rather than the contents. We have seen all this sort of thing before. This is not new when it comes to this minister. This is a bit like the letter from the New South Wales minister that suddenly did not appear but happened to appear. It is like the time the then Prime Minister&mdash;remember Mr Hawke&mdash;was accused of crass politics over new federalism and the tape that allegedly cleared the minister could not be provided and nor could the transcript. If people actually wanted to get into this scheme, they did better if they did not document it properly and they could not show that there was an adequate community need. I will tell honourable members why. This was not being distributed on the basis of community need at all. This program was all about buying votes for Labor candidates with taxpayers' money so that Labor candidates could get elected to control the disbursement of funds, to disburse them, to get elected, to control the disbursement of funds, to disburse them, to get elected, to control the disbursement of funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the One Nation program this particular program actually had a boost of about $18.75 million as a job creation scheme. For whom was it a job creation scheme? Labor candidates in marginal electorates! That is where the jobs were coming from out of this particular scheme. No jobs were being directed on a needs basis. Jobs were being geographically distributed to ensure that public money could be used for the benefit of candidates in marginal seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the minister replies she should not try to attack the Auditor-General. That is the trick of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). Whenever he gets an adverse report by the Auditor-General, his trick is to stand up and attack the Auditor-General. We know the government's view on the Auditor-General. The government is so intent on ripping money out under that Centenary House lease deal that it is prepared to let the functions of the Auditor-General wind down to enrich the Labor Party. However, it should not attack the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a case where there was ministerial incompetence, administrative failure, money gleefully ripped-off on geographical and political grounds and where the relevant documentation that exists in the minister's office which, it is said, justifies these particular grants cannot be released. The people of Australia have every right to ask themselves what this minister has to hide. Why is it that this minister cannot come clean with the public? Why is ministerial accountability missing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General said that questions concerning the degree to which ministers are accountable were the subject of much public debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister failed to correct systemic failure. In fact, the minister implemented systemic failure to ensure that this was decided in her office, that it was distributed on grounds that advantaged her politically, to lock out the people who really did need these things and to make sure it was done for her self-interest rather than the public interest. The minister has been fingered by the Auditor-General and she stands condemned. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accusations made by the shadow minister for finance, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), are not correct and are not substantiated by the Auditor-General.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with many of the recommendations in the report, which do need to be taken into consideration if and when we have a new program.

When honourable members read this document they will see an attachment outlining the response of my department giving a commitment to take on board the considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it should be remembered when looking at this issue of the management of this program that, currently, 99 per cent of the costs of this program go straight to the community. One per cent of total funding goes on administration. Looking at the implementation of these recommendations, it has to be remembered that if more money is put into the administration of this program then there is less money to go to the communities in need. That has to be remembered when looking at any future planning of this program, if indeed a decision is made to continue this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main thing that is forgotten in this report is the focus of need in the community. Can anyone in this parliament really say that the Australian community did not need that sports facilities program? Can anyone really say that? Thousands of communities across this nation have benefited from this program. It is a program where there was a clearly identified need. When that is linked with the guidelines and the selection criteria, which everyone gets when applying for a grant, it can be seen that priority will be given to the needs of residents in the new suburban areas. Many of those areas are often in Labor seats. With residents in inner urban areas, there are some Labor seats again. Youth in the community, communities in rural areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, communities with high unemployment&mdash;unfortunately some of them are Labor seats as well&mdash;and communities with large migrant populations, these factors are taken into consideration with the distribution of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recommendations of the Auditor-General that I do have some problem with is that the Auditor-General recommends that we do not have small grants. I think that would be a problem because many small grants&mdash;grants of $10,000 or $15,000&mdash;through this program have been incredibly valuable.

The applications then come to my department and it eliminates the ones that do not fit in with the guidelines and the selection criteria. The three categories that were referred to in the Auditor-General's report refer to those applications which are eligible. When funding is allocated from any of those three categories, they are all eligible. In the last round, 55 per cent of category one applications were funded, 20 per cent of category two, and 15 per cent of category three. Therefore, if an application were submitted which fitted into category one, it would have a much better chance of being successful than if it were in category two or category three. Often the application may have been very good in category three but there may have been some slight technical problem with it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, once we get rid of the smokescreen, once we get rid of all the allegations that are not substantiated by this report, we will see what this is really about.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like now to refer specifically to the report. I would like to go through the case studies that are specifically referred to in the report. Rather than just go through all the superficial accusations made by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Higgins, I would like to go through the specific cases because, after all, this is a program directed at specific cases where there is a need in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report refers to what it says are a number of anomalies. It refers to eight projects which it believes were approved outside guidelines. In a couple of these cases the points raised highlight potential inadequacies in the department's follow-up procedure, and of course these will be rectified in the future. However, after a detailed look, it is difficult to see how these cases can be construed as anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the one which is called `Payment in excess of program limit'. That in fact refers to a project in Western Australia called Altone Park. The report says that the amount of money allocated exceeded the program guidelines. What is clear is that in round three it received $100,000 and in round four it received an additional amount of $250,000. It did not go over the limit. The same thing goes for Hindmarsh Stadium. As in the first case, that project received a grant of $100,000 in round three and $250,000 in round four. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is specifically on the report. A $50,000 grant was provided to assist in the construction of a sports medicine facility. The audit office says that this was simply a substitute for state funding. The reality is that without that money that project would not have gone ahead and that school would not have become the centre for sports in the western suburbs of Sydney. That $50,000 has been a catalyst for producing a school of incredibly high quality in relation to sports education, and that $50,000 has gone into producing facilities not just in one electorate but for the whole region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That goes to the heart of this issue. Many of those projects are not confined to one electorate or another; they service a whole region and service a need for a whole region. One can go through all the other examples. The opposition says that, in terms of commercial facilities, we should not have funded an area like the St George rugby league Jubilee Oval. Without those funds, would that oval have been completed? The answer is probably no. The same goes for many other examples. So the needs of the community are at the heart of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my contribution to this discussion by referring to some of the positive aspects remembering, first of all, that in each of those examples referred to&mdash;specific examples of so-called anomalies&mdash;one can demonstrate that there were not anomalies. In the Auditor-General's report specific recommendations were made where we can obviously improve some of the administration, and we will do that in future grants. But at no stage in this report does the Auditor-General acknowledge the real needs of the communities in Australia. That is what those opposite lose sight of in this debate. It is about time we put a focus on the demands of members of the Australian community, no matter where they live and no matter what electorate they live in. That is the point of this matter.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO noted some anomalies in the approval of grants (worth $29.5m in 1992-93) by the Minister but was unable to resolve them because the reasons for decisions were not adequately documented.

<PARA>The minister has been asked on at least half a dozen occasions to provide the information. The ANAO has said that she should provide it.

<PARA>That is very magnanimous. But listen to this. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once the successful applicants are selected the Minister's office advises the Department. The Department then prepares a formal submission to the Minister together with letters to all applicants.</PARA>
<PARA>Wait for it&mdash;it continues:</PARA>

<PARA>And guess who signs the unsuccessful ones? It is the department she is trying to protect. It just goes on and on. This is an absolutely phoney program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the program. Firstly, it was a worthwhile program. The social significance was dramatic with those 1,000 jobs in those 1,000 communities where funds were made available. Jobs were created by works programs going on the ground straightaway in exactly the way that we required to get the economy moving. I commend the minister for making this happen in a hurry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, how can those opposite say in this parliament that badly needed sports, recreation, health and exercise facilities in marginal seats or non-marginal seats on either side of this House were not required in the Australian community? Of course they were required. I will come to some of the op-position's people and how embarrassed they are going to be about this in a minute. The minister has a sheaf of letters from a number of communities, councils and groups saying, `Thanks very much'. So let us get to the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not really on about the program; we are on about the distribution of the funds. Let us go to a serious analysis of this question of the distribution of the funds. The claim being made is that Labor marginal seats got more money. So what? Let us have a look at it. We are the government and, of course, we have more marginal seats than the opposition. Big deal! If the opposition had been the government it would have had more marginal seats. More importantly, where are they? Go to the western suburbs of Sydney, go to the outskirts of Melbourne, go to the rural and provincial areas where we have the marginal seats, and that is where we will find that the need exists. It is not like Toorak and it is not like North Shore where people have lovely, indoor, heated swimming pools and all the facilities. The need is in the seats where residential areas are growing quickly. Young families cannot afford to pay the rates that councils need to produce these facilities. They are the communities that need this seed funding, and they are the funds that came through this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister touched briefly on the example of Westfield High School in the western suburbs of Sydney. There was a $2 million development for which the federal government's grant was a grand $50,000. The Auditor-General somehow thinks that there is something wrong with getting a project going with a grant of $50,000. The project is producing jobs and benefits in the community. Most interestingly, New South Wales Premier Fahey and his education minister, Mrs Chadwick, the opposition's colleagues, are roaming around the west of Sydney claiming credit for the project and saying what a wonderful project it is in the west of Sydney. Who produced it? The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to the claim that Liberal marginal seats were not funded. I was disappointed to learn at question time today how ineffective I am as a local member in central Victoria. In my seat on the north-western outskirts of Melbourne I am surrounded by three marginal Liberal seats. Those three marginal Liberal seats got nearly three times the funds that I got in my electorate. Surprise, surprise! One of those seats was that of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). I want to touch on the reason why there may not have been more funds in Liberal seats. Let us look at what happened in Ballarat. It might be something to do with the fact that those opposite opposed our program and did not even support their own community groups' applications. </PARA>

It was not until the minister took the responsibility and knocked heads together that the honourable member then started writing his letters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give another example. In the very safe Liberal seat of Corangamite there is a lot of yardage for the Labor Party in funding a program in the downtown suburb of Colac. I apologise to the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) for calling Colac a suburb. Colac is a lovely town and he came from there originally. In Colac members of the community decided that they wanted to apply for funding for the swimming pool project. There was a strong community base of support. They went to the Liberal member and asked for support for that project. But he said he felt the program was a waste of time and he was opposed to it. He was not even prepared to write a letter of support to the minister about that program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local Labor Party branch&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;then made representations to us and put that program into the community psyche.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also an implication that with the small claims&mdash;the category 3 projects&mdash;the minister in some way or other was imposing her own priorities, or those of other people, on the department. I will give an example from my territory&mdash;not my electorate but the township where I live. I saw the recommendations from the department concerning the area, about which I have local knowledge. I made representations to the minister's office because I felt that the department's recommendations on a couple of those grants were out of kilter with the needs of the community. As a result, the minister was prepared to seek more information. </PARA>

When people in Australia visit Kyabram and look at that project they will say wow. It was not recommended in representations from the other side.

<PARA>in this area have been contained in numerous Commonwealth statutes, state and territory laws applied by the Judiciary Act, police instructions or general orders and case law. This has lead to a considerable degree of uncertainty and inaccessibility of the law. Indeed, recent public concerns about the Victorian government's Crimes Amendment Bill highlight the need for this parliament to make specific provision for laws relating to search, arrest and related matters in the investigation of Commonwealth offences.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now mention some important features of the bill. The bill precludes the issue by lay justices of warrants for search or arrest in relation to Commonwealth offences. Only magistrates and justices of the peace or other persons employed in a court who are authorised to issue search warrants and arrest warrants, as the case may be, will be able to issue such warrants. Further, the bill recognises three different types of search to which a person can be subjected and lays down clear criteria and procedures for their conduct. Practical difficulties which might otherwise flow from the removal of the power of lay justices to issue warrants are to be met by the introduction of telephone warrants. Easy access to magistrates or court employed justices of the peace is assured by the ability to use telephone, facsimile or other electronic means. The bill creates a number of new offences in relation to applications for search warrants made by telephone and other electronic means. There is also a general offence, applicable to all warrants, of making a false statement in an application for a warrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill prescribes in considerable detail the procedures which a police officer must follow to obtain a search warrant. The intended scope of the warrant must now be clear on its face. For example, if it is contemplated that a warrant obtained to search premises also authorises the search of persons at those premises, the warrant must clearly state this. Furthermore, to prevent the unnecessary execution of warrants on homes at night, the hours during which the warrant may be executed must be specified in the warrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a police officer applying for a warrant suspects that, in executing the warrant, it will be necessary to use firearms, the issuing officer must be told this and the reasons for this suspicion so that he or she can take this into account in deciding whether to issue the warrant. This is particularly directed to situations where, given the nature of the offence and the character of the suspects, it is more likely than not that violence will occur and it is anticipated that special weapons squads will be used. It is not, of course, intended to preclude the use of firearms where this is necessary in the circumstances as they develop when the warrant is being executed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill requires that a copy of the warrant be made available to the occupier of the premises or to the person to be searched. The force used in the execution of the warrant cannot exceed that which is both necessary and reasonable. Search warrants will authorise the seizing of evidence of the offence to which the warrant relates as well as evidence of any other indictable offence. A warrant to search premises may, at the discretion of the issuing officer, also authorise the search of people at, or near, the premises when the warrant is executed who are suspected of being in possession of evidence or dangerous items. Any person searched must be shown a copy of the warrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill puts beyond doubt the right of police to be assisted by non-police experts. This will be particularly useful when the execution of the warrant involves operating computer equipment to locate evidence of an offence. The bill permits the operation of equipment so that any incriminating evidence may be secured and retrieved but ensures that appropriate care is exercised to minimise damage to equipment. However, if damage is caused as a result of insufficient care in its operation, compensation may be payable to the owner of the equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill preserves the law relating to legal professional privilege. The current guidelines developed between the Australian Federal Police and the legal profession in relation to seizure of documents from solicitors' offices will continue to apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill classifies personal searches as `ordinary', `frisk' and `strip' searches. A search warrant issued in relation to a person may only authorise a `frisk' or `ordinary' search. Procedures for any form of personal search, either under warrant or conducted after arrest, are strictly circumscribed to ensure both the effectiveness of the search and the maintenance of the privacy and dignity of the person searched. Strip searches may only be conducted after an arrest if authorised by a police officer of the rank of superintendent or higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, searches must be conducted by a person of the same sex as the person being searched. Strip searches cannot be conducted in the presence of any person of the opposite sex except where a medical practitioner of the same sex is not available or where the other person is a parent, guardian or personal representative and the person being searched does not object. The existing power of police to stop and search vehicles in emergency situations contained in sections 10A and 10B of the Crimes Act, which were also based on the recommendations of the review committee, will be re-enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill introduces into Commonwealth criminal law a general offence of failure of a person to give his or her name or address to a police officer who has reason to believe that the person is able to provide information about a Commonwealth offence. Such an offence exists in many specific enactments, but there has been no general provision such as exists in many other jurisdictions. The bill gives effect to the review committee in recommendations to repeal sections 8 and 8A and to replace them with more detailed and precise provisions about when arrest without warrant is permissible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The power of arrest without warrant by members of the public&mdash;that is, citizens arrest&mdash;is limited by the bill to suspected indictable offences in specified circumstances. Although the power to apply for, and issue, warrants for the arrest of persons for Commonwealth offences continues to derive from state law under section 68 of the Judiciary Act, the bill imposes a number of additional procedural requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for a scheme for the taking of identification material, including finger, hand and foot prints, voice recordings and handwriting samples, from a person in lawful custody for an offence. A police officer of the rank of sergeant or higher may take identification material if the person gives written consent or if that police officer believes on reasonable grounds that the taking of material is necessary to establish the identity of the person, to identify the person as having committed the offence or to provide evidence of an offence. There are limits on the retention of the material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill expressly preserves other laws, including state and territory laws applied to Commonwealth offences, by virtue of section 68 of the Judiciary Act, relating to the taking of forensic samples. Although this is a very necessary bridging provision to ensure that Commonwealth investigators have continuing access to law enforcement powers, the Commonwealth has reservations about some aspects of the Victorian Crimes Amendment Bill. Accordingly, I foreshadow that I will be bringing before the parliament early next year a proposal relating to the taking of forensic samples as they relate to the investigation of Commonwealth offences. The bill also regulates the holding of identification parades and the carrying out of other identification procedures. It provides for the return of items seized, whether under warrant or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is designed to make public the powers of police and the rights of individuals in the important areas of police investigation with which it deals. In the past, many of the areas covered have been dealt with in police instructions or general orders, which are not generally available to the public. This is incompatible with modern concepts of open administration and access to justice. I believe the bill makes a significant advance in clarifying the powers of police and the rights of individuals in these important areas of police investigation. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to complete the process of bringing Australia's maritime zones into line with those to which Australia is entitled under international law, as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The bill makes changes to existing law in four principal areas. These are the establishment of rights in an exclusive economic zone, adoption of a revised definition of the continental shelf, assertion of rights in a contiguous zone and adoption of new international legal provisions for the drawing of territorial sea baselines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal legislation to be amended is the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973. The bill amends, in a consequential way, a number of other pieces of legislation. At present the Seas and Submerged Lands Act refers to the 1958 Geneva conventions on territorial sea and continental shelf. References to those conventions are no longer appropriate. In 1982 a new United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was adopted and signed by Australia. Australia has not yet ratified the convention. That convention, however, now has 59 ratifications and is likely to enter into force in the near future&mdash;it needs 60 ratifications to do so. It is, apart from the provisions relating to mining of the deep seabed, generally accepted as reflective of international law. The government considers that in relation to maritime zones the convention should govern Australian practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, consultations are taking place under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with a view to overcoming some of the difficulties that have arisen under the convention in relation to the provisions dealing with deep seabed mining. If these consultations are successful, Australia and other developed states will be in a position to give serious consideration to ratifying the convention and hence ensuring that it is universally accepted as the law on the subject. It is therefore appropriate, at this time, for Australia to amend its domestic law to bring its practice in relation to maritime zones into conformity with that provided for in the 1982 convention. As I indicated earlier, Australia considers the maritime zone aspects of the convention to be reflective of customary international law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has, over the years, gradually asserted its various maritime entitlements under international law. Thus, in 1983 certain territorial sea baselines were proclaimed and in 1990 a 12-nautical mile territorial sea was established in place of the previous three-nautical mile territorial sea. As long ago as 1979 Australia established a 200-nautical mile fishing zone. The current bill will complete the process of bringing Australia's maritime zones up to date. It replaces operative provisions in Commonwealth legislation which refer to the 1958 conventions with references to the 1982 convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes clear that Australia asserts the full rights to which it is entitled under international law in a 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone. As stated in the preamble to the bill, the rights that Australia has in such a zone include not just sovereign rights over both living and non-living resources but also jurisdiction as provided for in international law in relation to the establishment and use of artificial islands, installations and structures, marine scientific research and protection and preservation of the marine environment. The sovereign rights and the jurisdiction which a coastal state possesses in its exclusive economic zone in regard to these matters are set out in detail in the 1982 law of the sea convention, the relevant parts of which form a schedule to the bill. It will be for future legislation to deal expressly with matters such as pollution control in the exclusive economic zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also adopts the definition of the continental shelf in the 1982 convention. The 1958 convention defines the outer limit of the continental shelf in terms of a depth of 200 metres or beyond that to a depth capable of exploitation. This open-ended definition has proved unsatisfactory and customary international law has recognised that the limit of the continental shelf is the edge of the continental margin and that it does not include the deep seabed. The 1982 convention contains in article 76 a precise definition of the continental shelf. This is a minimum 200 nautical miles regardless of the physical configuration of the shelf. Beyond that distance, where the configuration of the continental shelf allows, however, the limit may extend to a distance not exceeding 350 nautical miles from the baseline or 100 nautical miles from the 2,500-metre isobath. This limit is calculated either by reference to the depth of sediments or the distance from the foot of the continental slope, defined by gradient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adoption of the 1982 definition will enable Australia to claim a larger total area of continental shelf than under the 1958 convention. The gains made by adopting the new definition outweigh any potential minor losses and will bring Australian legislation into conformity with internationally accepted principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, also for the first time in Commonwealth legislation, deals expressly with a contiguous zone. This zone extends from the limit of the territorial sea to a distance no greater than 24 nautical miles from the territorial sea baselines. It is a zone in which a coastal state can exercise rights of control to prevent infringement of customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and to punish infringement of the above laws committed within its territory or territorial sea. It is envisaged that specific legislation such as the customs or quarantine legislation will in due course be amended to assert more fully the rights to which Australia is entitled in such a zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends in a consequential way a number of acts as set out in schedule l. These amendments mostly relate to the definition of `continental shelf' in those pieces of legislation so as to remove references to the 1958 convention. One amendment of particular note is the alteration of the adjacent area boundary under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act in relation to Tasmania and Western Australia. This will ensure that the operation of that act extends to all the areas of continental shelf which Australia is entitled to claim under the 1982 convention definition. The existing adjacent area `picture frames', which are used in certain offshore area legislation, do not extend far enough in those two areas. The relevant parts of the 1982 convention are set out in schedule 2 to the bill and will form part of the revised Seas and Submerged Lands Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passage of this legislation reflects the need for Australia with its significant interests as both a coastal and maritime state to position itself to take advantage of developments in the law of the sea. Australia's action in this regard will promote further consolidation of coastal and maritime state rights and obligations as set out in the 1982 convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention that the bill does not affect the offshore constitutional settlement.

<PARA>The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill is a portfolio bill which will make minor amendments to the Commonwealth's anti-discrimination legislation, the Privacy Act 1988 and the High Court of Australia Act 1979. I will only outline the significant parts of this bill, as a number of the amendments it contains are merely technical or made as a result of other legislative amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, amendments were made to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 to simplify and streamline the procedure for enforcing determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the Federal Court. Briefly, that procedure provides that the determination, on being registered in the Federal Court, becomes enforceable as an order of the court after 28 days, unless the respondent to the determination applies for review of the determination within this period. I am concerned that this strict 28-day time limit may cause injustice in some circumstances, so I have introduced amendments to allow the Federal Court to review a determination outside this 28-day time limit in exceptional circumstances. The bill will make a number of amendments to the Privacy Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedures for making a representative complaint and for enforcing determinations under the Privacy Act will be replaced by new provisions modelled on last year's amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and Sex Discrimination Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also clarify that compensation awarded by the Privacy Commissioner to a complainant as part of a determination can include compensation for loss or damage suffered by way of injury to feelings or humiliation. This will bring the Privacy Act provisions into line with the position under the Crimes Act 1914&mdash;in relation to spent convictions&mdash;and the Disability Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act. These amendments will ensure greater consistency in the legislation administered by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend the rules under the Privacy Act governing disclosures of credit information by credit providers to state and territory government authorities administering schemes which assist low income earners to obtain mortgage credit. It was brought to the government's notice that the Privacy Act, as it is currently structured, does not sufficiently cater to the information needs of a number of states that operate, and effectively underwrite, mortgage assistance schemes. The amendment will resolve the information needs of the governments without unreasonably infringing the privacy of individual borrowers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am introducing an amendment which will delay the commencement date of the superannuation amendments which were inserted in the Sex Discrimination Act in 1991. These provisions were to commence in June this year in order to give superannuation funds time to develop options to allow existing members to transfer to non-discriminatory schemes. The guidelines to be formulated by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to assist funds to develop non-discriminatory options were not finalised in sufficient time. Accordingly, I have introduced an amendment to delay commencement of the provisions until 1 July 1994 to allow time for the funds to be in a position to comply with the new regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the High Court of Australia Act 1979 will change the administrative structure of the High Court by amalgamating the existing offices and responsibilities of the clerk of the court and the registrar into one office which is to be called the `Chief Executive and Principal Registrar'.

<PARA>This bill gives effect to the decision announced in the budget to change the safety net arrangements applying to general patients under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The PBS, which for more than 40 years has been providing the Australian community with access to necessary medicines, enjoys international recognition for its success. A number of adjustments are being made to the PBS through the 1993-94 budget to further improve its cost effectiveness and operating efficiency. The PBS safety net, which was introduced in 1986 to help people who need a lot of medicines, will remain available. There will be no changes to the safety net arrangements for pensioners and other concessional beneficiaries. Changes are being made, however, to general patients' entitlements under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the use of medicines under the free safety net for general patients increased by more than 150 per cent over the previous year.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With an ageing population and the development of new drugs, the costs of operating the PBS are increasing every year. In 1992-93, for instance, costs increased by 25 per cent over the previous financial year to around $1.5 billion. This cost must eventually be borne by the taxpayer. As well, there has been a growing tendency for people to stockpile medicines. In 1992 more than 70 per cent of the annual number of prescriptions for general patients were supplied in the last two months of the safety net period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill introduces a number of changes to address these issues. The safety net scheme has been simplified for general patients by eliminating the second free limit and increasing the first concessional limit to $400 per year indexed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the last of those three objectives in the bill is concerned, this is not the first time that a Labor government has attempted to delete reference to the Crown from the oath and affirmation. It was attempted in 1973 and again in 1984. On both those occasions the attempt was defeated in the Senate. In 1984 it was defeated by the coalition with the support of the Don Chipp led Australian Democrats. How the Democrats have slipped since then. I understand that the Democrats have supported the introduction of this wimpish pledge. The Democrats' role in this will be watched very closely by the Australian community because the government is attempting to initiate a premature debate on the republic and this bill is a segment of that debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to those opposite that constitutional change in this country can occur only if the Australian community says it wants a change. I think the government has been inclined to overlook this. It has stimulated a debate on the changes to the constitutional monarchy that we function under in Australia, it has commenced this debate on the republic and, in many instances, it has moved to a position without any consultation with the Australian community. The government must be reminded that that constitutional change&mdash;if it is ever to occur&mdash;can occur only if it has the support of the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, to whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.</PARA>
<PARA>The important part of that oath, which I believe needs to be quite clearly stated in any oath of allegiance in Australia&mdash;which is why I so strongly support it&mdash;is the fact that Americans declare on oath that they renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any other state or sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government here is attempting to move the debate on the republic further forward. Its proposals weaken the current citizenship oath. A wimpish pledge is really no substitute for an oath. That is why I raised Bishop Hollingworth's comments about that. I believe an oath has much greater strength in the legal process and requires a much greater commitment by a person making that oath of allegiance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this form the pledge significantly weakens the commitment required of new citizens. To me, the pledge does imply much less commitment than an oath or an affirmation. The wording of the proposed pledge itself contains absolutely no reference to the head of state, to the constitution or to any other of our basic institutions. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, may not like it, but Queen Elizabeth II is still the Queen of Australia under the law. Whilst she is the head of this country, I cannot understand why any government would seek to remove her name and a pledge of allegiance to her, because it is written into the laws of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This pledge makes a vague allusion to Australia and its people. That may be fair and reasonable. We are really talking about making a commitment by an oath. What we should be talking about is making a commitment by way of oath to the head of this nation. So long as the Queen remains our head of state, and our constitutional arrangements remain as they are, the oath or the affirmation of citizenship should continue directly to incorporate these facts. That is the way our present laws and our present structure operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Assistant Treasurer is suggesting for one moment that the Queen will be removed as the head of state of this nation, I tell him quite clearly that he must take it to the Australian community. The Australian community will decide whether the constitutional changes that the Labor Party is suggesting are enacted, not some minister who thinks he will change the oath of allegiance to a pledge and try to weaken the structure by chipping a little segment away here and a little segment away there. If the government were at all honest about this, it would have come up with a referendum and said, `Righto, we will ask the people of Australia whether in fact they want that removed from the citizenship oath'. I am pretty sure the Assistant Treasurer knows what the answer would be to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to refer to the promotion of this pledge by the government at the taxpayers' expense. This government promotion at taxpayers' expense will not be done at some small cost. The bill provides for $230,000 to be spent in the 1993-94 financial year. That is probably the commencement budget for it; there will be ongoing expenses to fund an information program and to introduce the new pledge and the preamble to the Australian community. It is really using that as part of its advertising campaign. It is a slush fund for the Labor Party to promote its ideas about the constitution of this country and the way this country should be run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure honourable members there are many more important things than an advertising campaign on this issue which asks the Australian community whether it agrees with it or not. Some of those important things, particularly in my own area&mdash;which is one of the highest unemployment areas in Australia&mdash;are jobs, jobs and more jobs. With over 7,000 people unemployed in my electorate, that $230,000 might have been better spent in doing something about some employment for those people who are out of work. In continuing with this promotion of the republic as a first chink or a second chink, without going back to the Australian community to ask whether it agrees with the line the government is taking, is quite outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government had any courage it would put this issue to the public in a referendum and ask whether or not the public really wants these changes. The government has tried to slide this in through the side door to get it through. When people take the opportunity to become Australian citizens and read this wimpish pledge they will have to make, they will say, `Well, it doesn't look as though the government feels any requirement to have a statement for which we are bound. The head of state of Australia is Queen Elizabeth II, so why should we worry about it'. There is a constant wearing away of the public's perception, and this is another move towards that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wording of the whole pledge, to me, does not really cover the commitment and the sorts of responsibilities that people becoming new Australian citizens feel. I have been to many celebrations where people have undertaken this solemn oath to become an Australian citizen, and they regard it very highly. They understand that they are taking on new rights and new responsibilities. They also understand and expect that certain privileges are attached to it as well. I put to the House that in fact we should be moving to a much stronger position on the oath of allegiance. I quote to the House some words which I have put together. They read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I swear by Almighty God (or in the Affirmation, I solemnly and sincerely promise and declare) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, her heirs and successors according to law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hereby declare on oath that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen and that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of Australia and fulfil all of my duties as an Australian citizen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I make this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, so help me God.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that would put a lot more strength back into the oath of allegiance and would impress upon people coming to this country that we want their absolute loyalty to Australia. That is what happens in many other countries. When people are welcomed into a country and decide to take the gigantic step of becoming a citizen of that country&mdash;as they do here in Australia&mdash;we want them to pledge and swear an oath of allegiance to be absolutely loyal to this country. I know that, after having spoken and visited many Americans, they take this extremely seriously. They make an absolute commitment to their country. The newcomers to the United States of America and Australia become amongst the most loyal residents and loyal citizens of their new nation. I hope that is where we would end up. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Reform Bill, which is now before the parliament, is arguably the most important piece of legislation to come on for second reading debate in the current parliament. It is perhaps coincidental that this bill is being debated in the same week as the Mabo native title legislation introduced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition welcomes this chance to debate this very important measure. At the outset, I would like to say, on behalf of the opposition, what great importance it attaches to reforming Australia's industrial relations system. Having said that, I have to say to the House on behalf of the opposition that we are profoundly disappointed that this bill does not live up to the rather flamboyant, exaggerated, high flown title that it carries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is described as an industrial relations reform bill. But anybody who has read the bill or followed the debate about industrial relations that has gone on in the community over the past few months would recognise that, far from this bill being an industrial relations reform bill, it is a trade union pay back bill. This is a bill paying back the trade union movement of Australia for the enormous support that it gave the government in the March election only eight months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you think, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I exaggerate that description out of a sense of political bias on these matters, let me invoke the language of Jennie George. Jennie George, as everyone in this House would know, is the Vice-President of the ACTU. The final terms of this bill were not settled between the government, the employers and the trade unions; but between the minister and the executive of the ACTU. They were the people who made the final decision as to what was going to be in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Jennie George was having a debate with Bryan Noakes of ACCI about the contents of the bill and she was told that the employers had some objections, her reply was very revealing. She said, `What the employers have got to understand is that we won the election in March and this bill is a payback for the commitments that were made by the government in the course of that election campaign'. The first thing that we should do in this debate is put aside completely the cant, the humbug and the hypocrisy that this in some way represents a reform to Australia's industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) would have won more marks with me, with the media of Australia and with the employers of Australia if he had said, `Look, brothers, this is blatantly a payback to the trade union movement for the support that it gave us'. Instead we had all of this nonsense about how he struggled, he strived, he thought, he stayed up late at night burning the midnight oil, he looked at numerous submissions and, at the end of the day, he finally reached the top of the hill and said, `I've reached a balance. The balance is fair. The balance is reasonable. I have struggled hard. I have given the employers a bit here and I have given the trade unions a bit there'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the minister: that really is nonsense. By his coy reaction&mdash;if this minister can have a coy reaction, and I do not mean that ungraciously&mdash;we can see he knows darn well that what I am saying is absolutely true. This bill is yet another chapter in the long history of this government paying its political dues to the trade union movement of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech to the Institute of Company Directors in Melbourne in April, just after the election, the Prime Minister said that this bill was meant to trailblaze deregulation of the labour market; that this bill was meant to genuinely open workplace bargaining to the non-union sector. The real test of this bill is the way it answers two questions. The first is: does this bill genuinely open workplace bargaining to non-unionists? The second is: does this bill deal equally with those who have a role in the industrial relations system of this country? I believe that this bill fails both of these tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill fails an even more important test: does it make a contribution to relieving the biggest social problem this country has at the present time, the problem of high unemployment? Much and all as this bill grieves me because of what it does to the secondary boycott law&mdash;and I will come to that in a moment&mdash;much and all as it grieves me because of the clayton's way in which it deals with the issue of workplace bargaining, and much and all as the opposition repudiates the obsessive use of the external affairs power in the constitution, the thing that above all condemns this bill is that it will make unemployment worse. This bill will add to the unemployment problem of this country because it will make Australia's labour market even more rigid&mdash;it will add greater inflexibility. It will import new minimum standards that make it dearer, more complicated and more expensive to employ Australians. That is a fact. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the honourable member for Lilley has joined this debate because he is the head of a committee that discovered the problem and then made a recommendation in the opposite direction. He was head of a caucus task force that identified one of the reasons for unemployment in Australia as the rigidity of our labour market. Did he recommend any change? No, he recommended that we spend more money on the problem. He will vote in favour of a bill that will make unemployment worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If government members are true to their most solemn political obligation to the unemployed of Australia, if they really care about those out of work, then they will vote against this bill. I have said before tonight that the best thing the minister could do is to forget about this bill&mdash;do not proceed with it; adjourn it indefinitely. The minister will be doing the unemployed a favour and he will be earning a few marks for himself in industrial circles in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons Australia has 11 per cent unemployed, and the United States has six per cent unemployed, is that our labour market is infinitely more rigid and inflexible than that of the United States. The United States has passed through the same recession as we have passed through and it basically has the same attitude to many things as we have. There has to be a reason why our unemployment is so much worse. Why is it that we have such high unemployment? Why is our unemployment level so much worse than that of a country like the United States, especially when we bear in mind that the United States has a much greater urban underclass than Australia has? The collapse of family life and social infrastructure in the United States is much further advanced than it is in Australia. The extent of poverty and so forth goes much further than in Australia. Yet it has a lower rate of unemployment. Why is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons&mdash;and I commend this to the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) and to the honourable member for Lilley&mdash;is the very simple proposition that in the United States it is not as complicated to employ people as it is in this country. What virtue is there in making it ever more difficult, complicated and expensive to employ people when the inevitable consequence of that is that the government makes it unlikely that employers will take on new staff? Has the government ever stopped to wonder why over the last 10 years there has been a huge rise in the number of part-time employees in this country and a sharp fall in the number of full-time employees? One reason is the great influx of married women into the work force and the great social change that is a consequence of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another reason is that it has become so complicated and expensive to employ people on a full-time basis. I would have thought that a government seized of that problem would have said to itself, `If we're going to change the industrial relations system, one thing we must do is not make it more expensive to employ people because that will add to unemployment. We ought to make it less expensive and less complicated'. The problem is not the level of wages. I have not argued for some years&mdash;I say this to the minister very directly&mdash;that the problem in this country is the level of wages. That is not the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manufacturing employees in Australia are, relatively speaking, paid lower rates of remuneration than they are in comparable places such as the United States, western Europe and Japan. The problem is the on-costs, such as the redundancy requirements, the superannuation guarantee levy, the termination requirements, the training guarantee levy, and all the other on-costs. The government cannot expand some of the great service industries of this county because of the prohibitive costs of running some of those industries at what are not normally regarded as the usual working hours of nine to five, five days a week. They are the things that make it expensive to employ people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that people are interested in reducing unemployment. That, I hope we all agree, is the big problem. It is certainly the problem that the people of Australia are worried about. We can get worked up about Mabo, the republic and other things, but I commend to all members of this House the Newspoll survey of a couple of days ago which showed that unemployment was at the top of the list of concerns for the people of Australia. Whether one votes Labor or Liberal, whatever one thinks of this bill, the real test of whether we are doing anything about the problems of this country is how we address the issue of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not pretend that I have a magical answer to unemployment; I have never pretended that. I do not pretend that we can get rid of unemployment quickly. It is a very slow, difficult, arduous task. One of the things we should not do is make it more expensive for small businesses in this country to take on full-time staff. That is one of the things this bill does. That alone is enough to condemn it. Why, in the name of logic, in the name of helping people who have jobs, does the government make it harder for people who do not have jobs to find work? Basically, that is what this piece of legislation is going to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members can make speeches, as undoubtedly they will during the debate, saying we are concerned with hacking away minimum standards. That is the usual rhetoric, but that really will not be addressing the fundamental issue: why make it more difficult and more expensive to employ people? The major reason I do not like this legislation is that it will make unemployment worse. That is about the most serious indictment of any piece of legislation that can be made in the current economic climate in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three principal areas covered by this legislation. The first destroys the effectiveness of a law that I was personally responsible for as the minister for business and consumer affairs in the Fraser government in the late 1970s. I can remember having a discussion with the then President of the ACTU, Bob Hawke, who later became Prime Minister of this country, and Paul Munro, the Federal Secretary of the then Australian Council of Government Employees, who, by coincidence was a colleague of mine at the Sydney University Law School in the late 1950s and early 1960s. I can remember Bob Hawke saying to me, `If you pass this legislation, there will be blood in the streets of Australia. It is anti-worker legislation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not take too much notice of that and we passed that legislation. There has not been blood in the streets of Australia. However, over the last 16 years there has been a situation where, if a trade union puts a secondary boycott on a small business calculated to bleed it to death, that small business can get immediate injunctive relief, as it has a perfect right as an Australian corporation to do. If a person is in business and puts a secondary boycott on another business to drive that business to the wall, that business can get immediate injunctive relief and it ought to have the right to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What those on the other side are doing with this amending bill is trying to establish a situation where trade unions are, in blunt terms, above the law when it comes to secondary boycotts. The government is going to strip away a protection, particularly for small business, that has been available and has worked well for the last 16 years. The government is taking it away because the ACTU has told it to take it away. It has been on the ACTU's hit list for 16 years because that law gave protection to the corporations of Australia that were the sharp end of union thuggery. I do not say that all unions behave in a thuggish fashion&mdash;I have never said that&mdash;but some do, just as some companies do. There should be a law that stops them both, and for the past 16 years there has been. If this bill goes through, there will be a law stopping the thug companies, but there will not be a law stopping the thug unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is that fair? Is that Australian? Is that the sort of governing for all Australia that the Prime Minister promised on the night of 13 March this year? Of course it is not. It is payback time for the mates. That is what this bill is all about. The government is paying it back in very large measure. Those opposite can talk about a procedure where after 72 hours we can go to law and get injunctive relief, but they must understand that some small businesses are broke in 72 hours if the supply of their product is cut off. Do those opposite not understand that we cannot have a secondary boycott on businesses for that period without them being bled white? Those opposite understand that very well, and that is why they are voting in favour of it. That is precisely what the ACTU wants. The ACTU wants to be able to blackmail companies into caving in because those companies will know that for 72 hours they bleed to death, and at the end of it there is nothing worth going to court to save&mdash;it is all gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who has had a modicum of contact with small business knows that that is the reality. I can only say through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the Democrats who sit in another place, `Heed the words of your founder, Don Chipp. You, the Australian Democrats, are supposed to, inter alia, defend the interests of small business against large corporations'. Large corporations can survive for 72 hours. If we are running a tiny operation we cannot survive for 72 hours. That particular provision is anathema. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second great layer in this bill is the wholesale use of the external affairs power of the constitution to import further ILO conventions into the laws of this country. Echoing some of the sentiments that were expressed in the previous debate, may I say how absolutely ironic it is that the Australian Labor Party is going around this country saying, `We have got to become a republic in order to establish Australian independence because it compromises Australian independence to share our head of state with a number of other countries'. Yet in the same breath the Labor Party is trading away day by day the sovereignty of this country by invoking international obligation after international obligation. Ever since the Labor Party has been in power it has embarked upon a pattern of conduct designed to use the external affairs power in order to distort and alter the domestic political balance in Australia. The external affairs power was never intended to be used for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no arguments at all with the use of the corporations power. That was projected in our own alternative policy taken to the last election. I have no problem with that. The Commonwealth parliament was given the power over corporations in the constitution, and as interpreted by the High Court I regard that as a totally legitimate use of the power. The external affairs power was never intended to be used as a stick with which to beat the states and to alter the federal balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it a supreme irony, contradiction and hypocrisy that these strident Australian nationalists, under this government, can now go to a UN committee and have a human rights claim adjudicated. I am all in favour of adjudicating human rights claims, but should they not be adjudicated in Australia? We abolished appeals to the Privy Council in 1986 in the name of Australian nationalism, sovereignty and independence; yet this mob, five years later through the back door, has handed over sovereignty to United Nations committees. Some of the representatives on those committees do not even come from democratic countries; they come from dictatorships. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do. I am glad that the minister agrees with me. Under this government&mdash;and the minister has confirmed it&mdash;we got rid of appeals to the Privy Council in order to assert our independence, but the minister is perfectly happy to go cap in hand to United Nations committees to have human rights claims adjudicated. What the minister is doing with this bill is in precisely the same genre as that kind of conduct. So these great robust nationalists are, day by day and week by week, handing over sovereignty to bodies that have no relevance at all. We trenchantly oppose this ritualistic use of the external affairs power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area of concern is the area that was supposed to be the hallmark of the minister's period in office. This minister was going to do what nobody else had done. He, a member of the Australian Labor Party, was going to genuinely infuse workplace bargaining for non-unionists into the industrial relations structure. Of course, he got no further than anybody else because, when the crunch came, Martin and Bill rang up the Prime Minister and said, `Look, we backed you to the hilt in the last election. You wouldn't have got there without our help. Don't you think for a moment that you are going to take any kind of power away from us'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important thing that has to be said about workplace bargaining is that there is nothing in this bill that alters one iota the monopoly that the trade union movement has over the bargaining process under Australia's industrial relations system. There are 71 per cent of workers in the private sector in Australia who do not belong to trade unions. What this legislation essentially says in relation to those people is, `Yes, you can do workplace bargains with your employer, and those employers can do workplace bargains with you, provided you go through four hoops'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first hoop is that the starting point for those negotiations has got to be the totality of the existing award&mdash;the no disadvantage test. That may rob a firm and its employees of the flexibility to reach a deal, for example, that would defer the payment of penalty rates for a period of 12 months on the understanding that if the company reached a particular profit performance it would get a bonus and a share of the profit. As I understand it, that would not be allowed under what the minister is proposing. Yet many people who follow these matters would regard that as eminent commonsense because that would not observe the totality of the existing award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second hoop is that the union has to be notified, even though the people being dealt with do not belong to the union. Any union that has any kind of award coverage in the area has to be notified. </PARA>

The minister will not deny this: any union that has an award linkage can come along and argue against it, even though none of the people covered by the agreement belong to that union. That is true, is it not? Of course it is true. We have a situation where 50 people employed by Wayne Swan Pty Ltd do a workplace deal with the owner of Wayne Swan Pty Ltd. None of those employees belong to a union; they cannot bear the union. In fact, with Wayne Swan's help the union organiser came to his shop and said, `Look, can we talk to the employees? Can we talk to the men and the women whom you employ?' He says, `Righto'. Being a generous sort of bloke he says, `You can talk to my employees. My employees will say, "Get lost. We don't want to talk to your union. We can look after ourselves"'. Wayne Swan says `Ta-ta' to the union delegate. He sits down and he negotiates a deal. He goes along to the Industrial Relations Commission and says, `Look, we all want this deal. The 50 of them want it, I want it, and it is good for everybody'. The Industrial Relations Commission says, `Yes, but we have got to hear from the union'. Wayne Swan says, `Oh, you must not do that. They threw him out'. The Industrial Relations Commission says, `That doesn't matter. They have a right to come along and object'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is saying that he is serious about extending workplace bargaining. He is shamed by that&mdash;he has that coy grin again.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does not deliver on any of the promises made by the Prime Minister. It is loaded in favour of the trade union movement. That does not surprise me. It strips away the secondary boycott protection that has worked so effectively over the last 16 years. It follows the depressing pattern of pawning Australian sovereignty by handing over, through the external affairs power, more authority over the affairs of this country to international bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation also establishes, quite unnecessarily, another court structure. I would have thought the last thing we wanted was another layer of courts. The Federal Court of Australia, through its industrial judges, is doing an excellent job. Even if the minister is obsessed about altering the secondary boycott law&mdash;which obviously he is&mdash;he does not need to establish another court to do that. He could make the changes&mdash;we will vote against them&mdash;to the secondary boycott law but leave it in the Trade Practices Act or transfer it to the IR act. We do not need a labour court. Why do we need another court when we have a million people out of work? Specialist courts are always a little suspect because the concern is that they will do special deals for special groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concepts of equality of law ought to be, as far as possible, that all Australians, irrespective of our station in life, are subject to the ordinary laws of this country, administered by the ordinary courts. The idea of establishing some kind of special court ultimately leads to the suspicion that some kind of special deal will be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is depressingly disappointing. The opposition&mdash;as the minister will conclude from what I have had to say&mdash;is not going to support the bill. We will be endeavouring to amend the legislation. I hope that in another place, where the balance of power is held by the minor parties, there will be some accommodation of some of the amendments that we will propose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the amendments that I will put forward&mdash;and move during the committee stage&mdash;deals with the clauses dealing with the termination of employment. Those clauses say that people's employment cannot be terminated on a number of grounds. One of the reasons a person's employment cannot be terminated is that that person belongs to a trade union or engages in trade union affairs&mdash;with the permission of his employer&mdash;during his employer's time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have any argument with that proposition; the belief that people should not be sacked because they belong to a union. It was part of our policy that unionists could not be victimised by reason of their union membership. But I would like it to also operate the other way. I cannot see any reason why a fair-minded minister would not agree to add to the criteria in that clause a simple provision that somebody cannot be sacked for not belonging to a union. I would hope the minister would nod his head in agreement because it is a fair, simple and even-handed proposition. If it is good enough to say, `Don't sack people because they belong to a union', why is it not good enough to say, `Don't sack people because they do not belong to a union.'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want anybody to tell me that does not happen; it does. It happens all the time. It happens in the Australian Public Service. I have correspondence from some people who applied to be interpreters in the Public Service. They got a reply from the department saying, `We are very sorry, but we have done a deal with the public sector unions saying that we will entertain applications only from people who are members of the union'. This happened in the last 18 months. I say to the minister, `Do not say that sort of thing does not happen'. It happens hand over fist&mdash;which is why there is almost 70 per cent union membership in the public sector; de facto compulsory unionism is operating. We are not very impressed with this bill.

It will do that by ensuring that formal enterprise bargaining is available to the widest possible range of workplaces. We have seen this recently. Since October 1991, more than 1,200 enterprise agreements have been ratified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Around 37 per cent of workers under federal awards are now covered by agreements. In Queensland recently there has been a dramatic extension of enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the state jurisdiction, where there are provisions which mirror the federal legislation, the number of agreements has increased by something like 400 per cent in total since March. Those agreements cover workplaces such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS>, the Southern Cross Foundry in Toowoomba, Driza-Bone on the Gold Coast, the Nerada tea packing factory, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make those points to illustrate that this trend towards greater flexibility in the workplace, with workplace bargaining and enterprise agreements, is already well down the track in the work force. It is a pity that members of the opposition do not talk to some of the businesses and employees that have negotiated genuine bargains within the existing framework. This package today will accelerate that progress and further accelerate the spread of enterprise agreements in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find listening to the honourable member for Bennelong today to be profoundly depressing. He puts forward unsubstantiated, ideological fundamentalism, claiming that the total cause of unemployment in our community somehow is the industrial relations system. He says that all the economic problems in our community are caused by wages, the trade unions and the industrial relations system. I find it even more depressing that he is joined in this endeavour by most of the economic commentators in the daily newspapers and most of the spokespeople and ideologues representing business organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to separate fact from fiction. The honourable member for Bennelong gave us an enormous amount of fiction and very little fact. He had the hide to complain about us adopting ILO minimum standards when he does not mind jetting off to Geneva every year to visit the ILO. If he is going to complain about ILO minimum standards and all such concepts in this legislation, he should forfeit the trip to the ILO and say what he really stands for. He stands for no minimum standards, individual contracts and slashed wages. He would take this country down the low wage, low productivity path of the American system that he eulogised in the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country grew in the 1980s. We had employment growth when we had a reasonably highly unionised sector. The Americans did not have our rate of employment growth; and they do not have a unionised sector. He cannot argue the point that differences in employment growth in this country and the United States relate to the industrial relations system. People in the Liberal and National parties misquote all sorts of figures from the United States and misquote academics such as Professor Gregory, trying to prove that the wage system is somehow responsible for our level of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>The most important fact that we need to acknowledge is that the work force in this country over recent years has already made very significant sacrifices. Real unit labour costs in this country have fallen by something like 10 per cent in the period since 1983. If award wages had maintained their real purchasing power since 1983, then a fitter in the metal industry would receive at least $55 a week more than the award currently provides for. The point is this: the work force of this country has already made very considerable sacrifices in the interests of making this country much more productive and much more internationally competitive and in the interests of generating jobs and doing something constructive about long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we get from the opposition in this House? Do we get any acknowledgment from the opposition that the work force in this country has made those sacrifices under the existing system&mdash;the system that it claims is causing unemployment? The answer is no; there is no acknowledgment of that at all. The opposition will not be happy until it has abolished the award system, minimum rates of pay and most of the conditions that we take for granted in this system. What it really wants is the low wage solution. It wants to force wages down to the equivalent of wages in some of the developing countries in our region. The opposition eulogises the need to have Asian levels of taxation, spending, social welfare safety nets and a low wage developing system that is found in countries like Bangladesh. The opposition has no ideas about how we can make this country more highly productive&mdash;a high wage, high productive, advanced, sophisticated manufacturing trading nation. We do not find, in any of the proposals put forward by the opposition, any strategy at all to further that objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition simply never acknowledges the intrinsic worth, dignity and hard work of the Australian work force. It simply does not acknowledge that through the last 10 years we have developed the dual system: a system of enterprise bargaining based on an award structure. This bill builds on that great achievement&mdash;and it is a great achievement of the 1980s. It builds on that so that we can create more jobs and make this country more internationally competitive in the years ahead. This gradualist approach that has been put in place by the Labor government in this country is the envy of many of the other countries, because it is producing the sort of employment growth and productivity growth that this country needs to become an international trading nation. This commonsense, gradualist approach is rejected by the opposition, because it has a completely different agenda. Its agenda is to deliver the big bang in industrial relations, to follow the Jeff Kennett solution and to follow what has been implemented in New Zealand under the conservatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately&mdash;and honourable members would not know it from anything mentioned by the opposition in this House&mdash;the overwhelming majority of the Australian work force and of the Australian people, and most sensible leaders of business, acknowledge that our approach is the way to go and that the approach of the opposition is simply caught in some 1890s time warp. All the opposition advocates is some laissez faire approach to economics, which simply says that labour is no different a factor of production than a nut or a bolt. It never acknowledges that labour has some intrinsic worth which makes it a fundamentally different factor of production&mdash;a factor which has to be judged in terms of fairness and skills formation. That is the fundamental ideological divide that exists in this debate. Fortunately, as I said before, the recent election determined that the majority of the Australian people support us and so do those leaders of the business community who are not the ideologues supporting the Liberal and National parties. I shall cite a few of those people. I quote from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of November 4 which reported some comments made by Mr John Prescott, the Chief Executive of BHP. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chief Executive of BHP, Mr John Prescott . . . dismissed the need for big changes in industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA>Did opposition members hear that? The head of BHP dismissed the need for big changes in industrial relations. The quote goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The BHP chief broke from employer ranks by endorsing the existing industrial relations system and warning against calls to abolish award wages and to shift to pure enterprise bargaining.</PARA>

I could quote that if the honourable member for Bennelong would like as well, because the opposition is running a million miles an hour away from Jeff Kennett and the New Zealand experiment. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> article went on:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The case for gradualism in industrial relations has been endorsed by practical people who have the responsibility for implementing a system of industrial relations which will make this country far more productive so that we can generate the jobs that we require. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal with the case put by the honourable member for Bennelong&mdash;the case that argues that the cause of our unemployment in this country and of the relatively higher unemployment in this country vis-a-vis the United States is somehow caused by our system of industrial relations. I will quote from a recent paper written by Professor Bob Gregory who had this to say about the case for gradualism and the case against the assertions put by the honourable member for Bennelong that the cause of out levels of unemployment were high relative wages. In a paper called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Structural changes and the Australian labour market</EMPHASIS>, published in a book which also had an article by the honourable member for Bennelong called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The future of work</EMPHASIS> published by ACOSS, Professor Gregory said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the labour market is the key market in which the greatest differences have emerged among OECD countries over the last two decades.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australia may well be at a watershed of labour market reform, and the nature of this reform may be the crucial and irreversible policy choice over the next two years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . recent labour market experiences in Australia, New Zealand and most of OECD Europe seem to suggest that the effects of adverse labour market shocks are not easily reversed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to think carefully before adopting policies of radical change&mdash;there are dangers associated with a rapid and too radical deregulation of the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">U.S. experience suggests caution before accepting some of the more optimistic forecasts of the benefits that will flow from radical deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA>Why would Professor Gregory say that? Firstly, he says that the deregulated so-called flexible US labour market has not delivered significant productivity growth in the last 25 years. I thought that productivity growth might have been something that the honourable member for Bennelong and the coalition parties were interested in. But the great US system that they laud and bow before has not delivered any significant productivity growth in the last 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Gregory asks this very legitimate question: in light of US experience, can we be sure there are any significant productivity increases in the offing if Australia significantly deregulates its labour market? The answer is, of course, no. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, Professor Gregory says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The better employment record of the U.S. relative to Australia, does not seem to flow from relative wage flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA>He cites as an example the Australian cost of female part-time employment per hour relative to male full-time employment, which is far in excess of most other countries&mdash;especially so with respect to the US. He says that in the United States women working part time are paid 40 per cent less per hour than men who work full time. In Australia women are paid five per cent less. In relative terms, female part-time employment is the fastest growing segment of the Australian labour market and the growth rate is far in excess of that in the US. In other words, female wages have risen faster in real terms in this country. It is in that area that the growth of employment in this country has been greatest. So how does the opposition's equation work? It simply does not work. When analysing the United States, Professor Gregory goes on to cite many other examples. Also his analysis of New Zealand disproves the case that the opposition puts for the big bang, Jeff Kennett-New Zealand type industrial reform. The very severe real wage cuts in New Zealand in recent times have not produced any significant employment gains at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So you are not arguing that; that is very good to know. New Zealand has had an employment growth of only 10,000 over the last two years despite severe cuts in real wages. What is the opposition really arguing? How low does it want real wages to fall in this country? Barry Hughes, the Chief Economist of CS First Boston, has suggested that if we wanted to have significant wage reductions, which would generate significant employment effects, we would have to cut wages in this country by the order of 30 per cent. A 30 per cent cut in wages to the average wage earner would be something like $10,000 a year. Is that what the opposition is suggesting? Is that the magnitude of the cuts that we need in the country if we are to produce the sort of employment gains that the opposition claims to stand for? Is it advocating a 30 per cent cut in the wages of average wage earners&mdash;$10,000 a year? The fact is that the overseas experience of the sort of deregulated labour market that the Liberal and National parties worship is simply that they have not produced the alleged employment gains which would come from a complete deregulation of the labour market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at what the opposition has had to say about its policy over the years. I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 1 November comments from the opposition's spokesman, the honourable member for Bennelong. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal coalition has vowed to make sweeping changes to the government's controversial industrial relations legislation, including scrapping the proposed new Labor court, if it wins the next election.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the coalition does, because that is what the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) stands for. He believes that we should be abolishing the award system.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You take the Kennett legislation, it's pretty much ours, and in that sense it's quite possible that the two of us could do it in tandem,&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>Those opposite will say, `We had better all do the same'. So the honourable member for Bennelong went into panic mode and repudiated the fact that their real intention is to abolish the award system and real minimum standards. They went into panic mode and denied that it was their policy. Of course, they might have been able to get away with it if it were not for the fact that the Western Australian election came along. The Western Australian government has gone straight down the road delivered by Jeff Kennett, straight down the road delivered in New Zealand and straight down the road that the coalition parties in this House want to go down, because it has now brought in a $275 a week minimum award wage. The current rate for a contract cleaner in Western Australia is of the order of $360 a week, so, if it suits the employer at the time, all the award is simply swept away and huge wage cuts and cuts to conditions are immediately made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be very clear about what the policy of the Liberal and National parties remains in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, honest to goodness, the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) has given us a real example of rhetoric and innuendo but he was very weak on valid argument. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill that we are debating in this House today is about a whole lot of things, but reform is what it ain't about, except if one accepts that it further entrenches the power of one side of the debate, that is, the trade union monopoly&mdash;this bill certainly does that. This bill is about protection, employment&mdash;it is not about unemployment; it is about employment&mdash;lack of freedom of association, privilege, sovereignty and bureaucratic mechanisms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 April the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) showed, in a speech to the Institute of Company Directors, that he had really listened well to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Treasury. He got the idea stuck in his brain somewhere that if his government started to free up the labour market, to remove some of the protection of the rules and regulations that surround the labour market mechanisms in this country, we might do something about encouraging employment and reducing unemployment. He held out some hope for Australia but, unfortunately, the Prime Minister was very busy at the time. The Prime Minister was running around in the middle of the republican debate, in the middle of a disastrous budget, and spending heaps of hours trying to come to grips with this thing we call Mabo.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, Mr Kelty, the Secretary of the ACTU, was extremely busy all over Australia with the regional development business and also spending time with the board of the Reserve Bank&mdash;and the Prime Minister and Mr Kelty sort of let the debate get away from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What really happened was that the powerful secretaries of the powerful unions got themselves together and said, `What the Prime Minister promised the nation in his speech of 21 April ain't our agenda, baby. We funded the government's election campaign and put troops on the ground in the thousands to make sure the ALP got back into power and we are not going to have any of this deregulation garbage, my friends'. What happened was they hit the ACTU congress and&mdash;boy!&mdash;the Prime Minister rolled over so quickly, Kelty rolled over and it was not on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) got stuck with it&mdash;and did he get stuck! The ACTU congress tore him apart. So what did he do? He backed away at a million miles an hour. We saw him going like a scalded cat. What happened? We got this bill as a result. This bill is about protection, is it not? At a press conference following the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting John Major said on behalf of himself, our Prime Minister and other heads of Commonwealth governments, `We want growth. We want jobs. We don't want protection'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is this industrial relations so-called reform bill all about? It is about protection. The minister's second reading speech, his press releases, the bill and the explanatory memorandum all say that this measure is about protection, enhancing the award system, ensuring that trade union bureaucrats are protected from any action that might occur as a result of their flagrant abuse of our laws of freedom&mdash;protecting them from the normal laws that other Australians must adhere to&mdash;entrenching union power and making sure that all these small employers with their small work forces and medium sized companies that would like to do some genuine reform now come under the control of the trade union bureaucracy. That is what it is all about. It is about protection; it is about protecting the employed at the expense of the jobless. This bill does not offer one jot of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sections 45D and 45E, a piece of law placed in the Trade Practices Act, have been very positive for Australia, with our unique conciliation and arbitration system and the so-called non-necessity for enhancing in legislation a right to strike, but has placed a tremendous burden on employers, because unions can take any kind of action whatever on the political environment or on any front and can attack a company's suppliers or a company's buyers with impunity without that act in place. So what will we do? The minister will move it to the Industrial Relations Commission. He will water it down and totally remove political strikes, environmental action and `others' from any consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So unions can take political action on any front about any issue that they like and there will be no consequences. And the government expects employers to have to put up with that. The government expects our economy to grow. It expects people to invest in new plant and equipment and new jobs while they are attacked under this kind of a mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister constantly talks about a safety net. But it is an award&mdash;a bureaucratic mechanism which sometimes goes up to as much as 100 pages of minute detail about working conditions of men and women of a particular craft, trade or job description in a plant or across the whole industry. The award is not a minima, but the minister is trying to make the award a minima. On 21 April the Prime Minister said, `We want to simplify awards. We'll simplify them and over time they will shrink, and in fact they will disappear'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we done with this legislation? We have made the award system even stronger so that it will live forever. The award system is nothing but a bureaucratic mechanism for deciding how people work and how they are paid. There is nothing free or simple about it. Certainly, it does not provide real protection for jobs because it discourages employers from employing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this bill we will add a labour court. That will really protect people. I can tell the House that the legal profession is not in favour of a labour court. Why not? Because it believes, rightly, that it is competent in the jurisdictions and that the general court can deal with all sorts of matters fairly and equitably on behalf of all Australians. But no, we need a special court to deal with unfair dismissals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we need? Does a judge of such a court have to have been unfairly dismissed or does he have to have been an unfair dismissor to be qualified to sit as a judge of the industrial relations court? What about that, Mr Deputy Speaker? Is that on the cards? Is that what we need? Is that what we are looking for? Will that help Australia's disastrous unemployment situation? Will that help our balance of payments problem? I do not really think so. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 30 and 31 October 1993 an editorial said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Promoting union power, boosting public spending and introducing new regulations will see unemployment rise, not fall.</PARA>
<PARA>That will be the result of the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. Terrific stuff! The OECD, in a statement about the variation between labour markets country to country and how they react to changes in circumstances, said, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The more flexible are real wages the more quickly unemployment has tended to fall following a recession&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>ours has not fallen very quickly, has it?&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the less has been the tendency of unemployment to trend upwards over time.</PARA>
<PARA>The OECD research tells that the more flexible a labour market is the lower level overall of unemployment in that particular economy and the less chance of unemployment sticking during a recession for very long when the recession is over. Ours is not changing because we have a regulated labour market which we will now even further regulate. Professor Judith Sloan, in response to this issue, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in terms of absolute numbers, the age group with the highest numbers of long-term unemployed are in fact those in the 20 to 24 and the 25 to 34 age groups. In combined terms, in 1992, there were nearly 140,000 long-term unemployed persons aged between 20 to 24 years old . . . We also know that approximately one-third of the 20 to 24 year old long-term unemployed have never held a job.</PARA>
<PARA>Never held a job! I fear for our youth because we are, as a result of the directions in which we are going, developing a class of young people, a generation, who may never work. Quite frankly, that frightens the life out of me. If it does not frighten the government, then it ought to; the government ought to be desperately worried about it. But what does it do? It says, `Let's see whether we can tax people more to provide some more unemployment programs to deal with this problem we created because we have to have a regulated labour market; because we have to protect the people who helped get us re-elected'. Very simply, that is what it is all about. The government has to help protect those people who got it re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has a no disadvantage test. In practical terms that says that, if one wants an enterprise agreement of any form, whether it is a consent agreement or whether it is an agreement for a non-unionised shop, in any case there is a whole great number of hurdles that one must pass. In fact, there are something like 16 separate obstacles that the company and its employees must jump before they can actually get to a certified agreement. That is eight up on what it was before this reform bill came in. So we are dramatically adding to the bureaucracy. Along the way we hit this thing called a no disadvantage test so that the totality of the award is examined but so also are each of the individual items of an award. The whole action becomes so bureaucratically ensconced that the chances of anybody actually using it, the chances of this providing flexibility, are now gone. </PARA>

The honourable member for Lilley seemed to imply that we on this side of the House had no regard for unions. That is demonstrably untrue. I am one who believes that unions do have a proper place in an industrial relations system, but that place should be determined by their ability to sell their services to their potential members. It should not be there by right, regulation or statute. That is what is wrong with this legislation, on top of our current industrial relations legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>He is right. Freedom of association, I tell you! It never ceases to amaze me that we talk about rights of employees and rights of men, women, cats and dogs, animals, and everything else, but our industrial relations legislation never provides a right for an individual not to be a member of an association. It always provides for a person's right to be a member of an association. This bill, in two places, makes sure that no-one is disadvantaged by being a member of a union. It says, firstly, that a person cannot be unfairly dismissed because he is a member of a union. That is fair enough; I happen to agree with that. The bill should also say that a person cannot be unfairly dismissed because he refuses to join a union, but it does not say that. </PARA>

This bill is not about freedom of association; it is about attempting to get the 39 per cent of the free market work force which belongs to unions up to 70 per cent or 80 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very good to see that the mask has finally come off those opposite since the federal election. The opposition, which has previously been arguing the line about flexibility, now acknowledges that its real policy is lowering wages, particularly for those who have got weaker market power. The New Right commentators in the newspapers and many people on the opposition benches are effectively arguing that this would enable employers to have more money to invest and, therefore, create more jobs. It is laudable that the opposition is interested in the issue of employment but, unfortunately, it has to recognise that not everybody agrees with its analysis. We do not accept the proposition that lowering wages for many workers in the community&mdash;mostly the lower paid and the lower skilled&mdash;would lead to higher employment.</PARA></TALK.START>

We need to look only at the massive shift during the 1980s, and continuing now, to the profit share in the economy, to see some of the waste that has occurred with investment funds in our society by some of the more well-known, so-called entrepreneurs. Australian workers do not necessarily have any faith in that sort of approach. I would suggest that, in our economy, demand is the primary generator of employment. Employers put more workers on when they have work for them to do that their existing staff are not able to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Bennelong. Demand drives employment and growth. Deregulation would simply mean that the wages for the lower skilled would fall, as they have fallen in areas such as the United States, by as much as 20 per cent. It would not create more jobs for those types of workers because there is a dwindling number of jobs of that type required by the present economy. It would ensure that there is effectively a transfer of income from the lower skilled, lower paid to the higher skilled and higher paid. There would be a zero sum game with respect to demand in the economy because demand would fall in certain areas and rise in others. If anything, the pattern of change in demand that would occur could be marginally negative because of the higher propensity for the better off to spend on imports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if it did work, even if the approach advocated by the honourable member for Bennelong were the correct path, it would still mean that the cost of solving the unemployment problem in the community would be paid for by those least able to bear that cost&mdash;the lower paid, those on the lowest incomes in the work force. Those who would suffer reduced wages as a result would be the ones who would foot the bill for solving the unemployment problem. Even if the honourable member for Bennelong were right&mdash;and I do not concede he is&mdash;we should contrast that with the prospect of tackling the problem through the taxation system, which the Liberal and National parties do not support because of the constituencies they represent. By tackling the problem through the taxation system we can solve the problem and also ensure that the economic burden of solving that problem is borne by those who can bear the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do it by lowering wages, the honourable member for Bennelong and I will not pay any of the cost because our wages will not go down. But if we do it through the taxation system we will, as higher income earners, help to contribute to the cost. The honourable member for Bennelong has compared our level of unemployment with that of the United States. He conveniently forgets to mention the level of unemployment in Britain which now has a totally deregulated labour market. The only significant regulation in the labour market in Britain is restrictions upon trade unions, yet it has a level of unemployment that is very similar to ours, like most of the other OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) has most effectively outlined, we have comparisons with New Zealand and my home state of Victoria where we are not as yet seeing any great signs&mdash;I confess it is early days yet and we have to withhold judgment to some extent, but I will be watching with interest&mdash;that the approach of the Kennett government is producing any substantial improvement in the employment situation. At this stage I can see perhaps the ghost of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) leaping off the empty bench over there saying, `What about Asia?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to talk about Asia because, contrary to the mythology that is very widely spread around the place, our system in Australia is not unique. In fact, the Asian tiger countries have regulatory structures which, in many respects, are quite similar to ours. The notion that we have this vast deregulated world out there is utterly wrong. The reality in countries like Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea and Singapore is that they all have various types of regulatory frameworks in their labour markets, much of it similar to ours and that of the United States. None of them are identical to any other labour market regulatory structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major differences between theirs and ours are, firstly, that enforcement is very ordinary in some of those countries; so, naturally, in certain respects some of the deregulatory structures are more ignored in the breach than followed. Secondly, in a number of those countries, particularly in a country like the Philippines, there are substantial subsistence sectors of the economy where there is family based employment and not wage employment and, therefore, regulation of this nature is not relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to cite a few examples of these regulatory structures. The employment act in Malaysia sets minimum wages and conditions, including regulation of hours, a minimum overtime rate of time and a half, annual leave, sick leave, maternity leave and public holidays. Does that sound familiar? These are exactly the sorts of things that are covered in our awards. In some instances, these provisions are more generous than those applying in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Malaysia, for example, where hospitalisation is involved, sick leave of up to 60 days per annum is the entitlement of employees. Obviously some of these other provisions are less generous&mdash;for example, in regard to hours&mdash;than provisions in Australia. There is a trade unions act under which unions must be registered, as is the case in Australia. There is an industrial relations act and an industrial court with conciliation and arbitration functions including, in certain circumstances, functions of compulsory arbitration&mdash;something which we are led to believe is unique to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Korea, union membership has doubled to nearly two million in the past few years. There is a very large number of smaller unions and a small number of very large unions. The labour union law in South Korea requires that employers bargain with the union where that union has members present. The labour relations commission is a tripartite body for resolving disputes. In the period 1987 to 1989, following substantial improvement in the level of democratic participation in South Korea, there was a massive upsurge in industrial disputes: from 276 in 1986, to 3,749 in 1987, to 1,873 in 1988, to 1,616 in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in the Philippines there is a labour code which specifies minimum conditions regarding hours, overtime, rest days, wages, annual leave, termination and the like. There is a fairly well developed system of voluntary and compulsory arbitration in place. Obviously there are differences. Obviously these systems are not exactly the same as ours. But what is happening in these countries is that, as they are developing, the regulatory structures are reflecting the demands and needs of ordinary workers. Wage levels are rising in exactly the same way that these developments occurred following the industrial revolution in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that we are so odd, that we are so much out of step with the rest of the world, is simply wrong. That is only one of the numerous myths and fallacies surrounding this debate. We hear that 70 per cent of the private sector is non-unionised. I accept that figure. But we have to look behind that figure and ask why, what is actually going on out there. It is partly a product of the fragmentation of the production process. By definition, unionism is much more related to large workplaces than to small workplaces. It is much harder to sign people up; it is much harder to service them in a smaller workplace, particularly where there are only two or three employees. There is a change in the structure of the economy which is driving the reduction in private sector unionism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many places are part unionised. In many workplaces that I as a union official used to deal with, we de facto represented non-union members because half the people were in and half were not. We took that on board and said, `Let's hope that gradually we might persuade some of them to join'. Many have refused to join or decided not to join because of fear, sometimes justified and sometimes not, of employer intimidation. As I said in this place before, this culture of `Don't join the union, don't call the union; you know what happens to people who do that' is widespread. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also many people&mdash;and this is a failing of the union movement, partly due to limited resources&mdash;who have not joined because nobody has asked them. There are thousands and thousands of workplaces out there. Unfortunately, the union movement resources&mdash;contrary to the sort of blather of the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles)&mdash;are limited and they are inevitably heavily concentrated on representing the interests of existing members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult when someone is in a union, as I was, covering something like 50,000 workplaces to go out to all of them and say, `Hey, would you like to join?'. In the recruiting work that I have done I have often found that individuals will be signed up as members simply because I have turned up. They say, `Yes, we would like to join. It is good to see someone has fronted up'. So there are logistic restrictions as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said that the award system is an impediment to efficiency. Where are the concrete examples? Where are the dozens and dozens of concrete examples where workers, unions and employers cannot resolve the problems that do exist? I have been involved in numerous discussions where difficulties have arisen with award provisions. I concede that there are circumstances in workplaces where a particular provision in an award can generate a problem. Every time we have been able to work through it and work out a solution that everybody is happy with. Why is it such a problem? Where are the examples where that cannot be done?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workplace industrial relations survey that was conducted a couple of years ago, which was the most comprehensive of its kind ever conducted in this country, returned a result where seven per cent of employers surveyed said that the award system was an impediment to change and to improvement in their workplace. In a very large proportion of non-unionised workplaces, far more so than unionised workplaces, many of the totem issues of industrial relations reform&mdash;such as demarcations, penalty rates and so forth&mdash;are not relevant. In the average small office we do not have demarcations because there is only one union. We do not even have penalty rates as an issue because people work nine to five; it is just an ordinary pattern. In lots of these places all of this deregulatory propaganda is simply irrelevant to the reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of international conventions is something that some of the fundamentalists of the opposition, and some of the weirder groups it tends to be associated with, are getting absolutely phobic about. A few weeks ago I noted that Max Walsh in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> suggested that, because of the reliance of this legislation upon ILO conventions, whenever an ILO convention changes the law in Australia will automatically change. Max Walsh should stick to talking about things that he knows something about. That suggestion is absolute nonsense. Any change in an ILO convention that forms the basis of this legislation will have to be ratified by the federal government and then that change legislated by this parliament for it to have any effect in Australia. The ILO conventions, as has been the case with other international obligations, under our constitution only give this parliament the power to legislate on matters that the vast majority of parliaments across the world already have the power to legislate on. That is some conspiracy, some threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also suggested that there is a huge demand for enterprise bargaining out there. All these companies have thousands of workers saying, `Free us from the shackles of union tyranny; we want to get out there and bargain equally with our boss'. It is absolute nonsense. In many instances, companies, particularly smaller companies, actually appreciate the award system because it gives them a level playing field on which to operate vis-a-vis their competitors. They want to pay a fair community standard related wage; they do not want to exploit people. Many employers are perfectly decent human beings who want to pay a reasonable rate. They actually use the award system as a means of ensuring that community standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to quickly turn to a very brief description of the sort of reality that occurs in workplaces, is the subject of this bill, and is the real basis of what we are legislating for. A typical workplace would be a small wholesale company, which employs 20 workers and is non-unionised&mdash;a union has never been there. There are numerous grievances: staff shortages, poor chairs and equipment, minimal training, employees often do not get lunchbreaks, the boss is pretty obnoxious, he has a son on the payroll who sexually harasses some of the female staff&mdash;that sort of thing happens all the time&mdash;there is an office manager who is blueing with the supervisor, things of that nature. Under pressure, the boss says, `We have to make some economies'. He sacks the cleaner. He tells the female office staff&mdash;not the males, but the female office staff&mdash;`You are now going to clean the toilets after hours with no extra pay, and you had better like it or lump it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If opposition members think that that sort of approach to `enterprise bargaining' is unusual or bizarre, they should think about the sort of thing that happened in a major Melbourne law firm that I had the misfortune to deal with not so long ago. After the Kennett legislation was introduced, the firm's employees, who were on a 35-hour week, had flashed up on their computer screens, `As of next week you are on a 37 1/2-hour week'. The managers of the firm did not even have the decency to tell them in person; it was up on the employees' computer screens&mdash;`As of next week . . . a 37 1/2-hour week'. That is the sort of enterprise bargaining that we often see in some of these companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will continue with my description of this typical workplace. This is based on a number of years of experience, which I suggest is a bit more in-depth than many members on the other side have had. Staff members have not had a pay rise for a couple of years. They are frightened of losing their jobs. Finally something breaks and they get the union in. A few staff members join the union and some side with the boss because they think, `Beauty, here is a chance where I may help ingratiate myself a bit'. A few issues are taken up. There is a bit of a resolution of a couple of matters. The boss listens to reason on some issues and then a few months go by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commitments are reneged on. Arrangements to cover the switchboard during lunchbreaks, for example, are allowed to lapse. The promised new chairs do not eventuate. Other things are not followed through. Then the woman who happened to complain about sexual harassment mysteriously gets sacked. Her exemplary record of over five years is not taken into consideration. She worked lots of extra hours. She recently had additional duties lumped on to her because the company was understaffed in that area. She was not trained properly for those extra duties. She had made a couple of mistakes because she was not properly trained and, bang, she is gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union is too weak at that workplace to do anything about it because it has, say, half a dozen members out of the 20 employees. They are all frightened for their jobs. So an unfair dismissal application is lodged&mdash;that great, incredibly threatening process that the honourable member for La Trobe referred to. After a few months of procedural wrangling there is a settlement: a couple of weeks pay and a reference. That is the typical outcome of an unfair dismissal case. The worker is advised by the union, `We could keep going but the case could take a year or more; you could be appealed if you win; you do not really want to go back there anyway after what has happened; you do not want to be exposed to all that again'. The end result: very little. That is the typical situation in Australian industrial relations&mdash;the reality of what this bill relates to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is not the militant builders labourers and wharfies of mythology; it is not the metal workers and the like going out on strike on trivial issues. Deregulation will not hurt the militant minority.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employment contract is not just another contract, as implied by the honourable member for La Trobe. It is the fundamental social relationship in our community. I would like to quote from a submission of the ACTU to the Hilmer inquiry which very effectively states this. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In labour markets, alone amongst all markets, the `things for sale' are simultaneously workers&mdash;people in society. The thing being sold is indivisible from the seller, and thus comes associated with a complex dynamic web of social interactions which lie outside the simple market transaction.</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberals want to deregulate the labour market in order to give more power and more income to their constituency, the people who are better off, and to take it from our constituency, the people who are less well off.

Ultimately, this legislation is about ensuring that we retain some basic human decency in our society, that that gap does not get too big and that, at the end of the day, we remain one Australia&mdash;a single community where there is equity maintained in the employment relationship and the society at large. </PARA>

Though it might be noted that there are many areas of the economy&mdash;the rural sector and self-employed generally&mdash;for which reductions in nominal incomes are the long accepted alternative to unemployment. Such solutions are not preferred in the formalised labour market but we should be quite clear that that reflects a choice.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The whole range of the microeconomic or structural reform issue under consideration, and others yet to be broached, reflect a similar reasoning. Those who reject such approaches simply fail to recognise the changes in the world environment that we face.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increasing ease of transfer of technology, of information, of capital and even of labour mean that the competitive production of manufactured goods can be expected to occur in an increasing number of locations around the world&mdash;not just, as now, in Asia. If we, Australia, wish to have a manufacturing future, we have no choice but to compete with such producers. We can only do so if we continue to improve the competitiveness of our own production processes. Because the scope to do that within individual firms is limited, at least in the short run, there is a need for the cost reduction process to be spread throughout the economy so as to affect all inputs to production. That is the essential story behind the structural reform agenda; it is the same story that will lie behind our future growth rate and hence our success with the unemployment problem.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a very lengthy quote, but I think it is very significant because it comes right to the core of the issue of costs and our competitiveness as a nation. There is no doubt that industrial relations is a vital area and it is in our national interest to make sure that we get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The title of this bill&mdash;the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993&mdash;is somewhat of a misnomer, as has been referred to before by my colleagues on this side of the House. My speech tonight will focus on two or three main areas. It will focus on the politically selective process and its weakness, not in a partisan way or in the context of the adversarial political process that we insist on embarking upon in this House&mdash;and no doubt it has many positives. But I will try to look beyond what we do in this chamber to what the national interest really entails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been stated earlier, the government has very much a vested interest in this bill because of its traditional links with the unions over the 100 years of its history. But it does not have a monopoly on morality. I was encouraged by what the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) had to say when he spoke on this subject in debate on a private member's bill two or three weeks ago. At that time, I thought he was somewhat more bitter in his approach. But this time he seemed to apply a little more reason and I see that as a sign of some encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He talked about the constituency that he represents, about Asia, our productivity, our competitiveness, and rising wage levels in Asia. He also talked about employer intimidation. Being an employee, I understand something about the intimidation and the power of the employer. Nevertheless, it was not enough to persuade me to go the way of many within the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He mentioned the fact that we in this place would not suffer if there were to be pressure on our wages; we would maintain our wages and we would all be okay. I have to say that if my wages have to alter in order to achieve full employment in this country over the next few years, then so be it. I am not frightened of that. I think it is important that we face that problem. As Ted Evans has said, we have to make a choice. We must never forget that we do have that choice. I agreed with what the honourable member for Melbourne said when he spoke about fair community standards for everybody&mdash;the employee and the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) talked about Bangladesh and slavery&mdash;some pretty extravagant stuff. I really did expect more from the honourable member for Lilley. I think the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) mentioned before the suspension of the sitting that he had expected more of a senior member of the Labor Party from Queensland. To compare the employers of Australia with the people of Bangladesh is surely right over the top. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then talked about slavery. Are we really going to suggest that, in 1993, we are into slavery in this country? I suppose if we were living in the year 1836, with the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of slaves&mdash;a very important time no doubt for the people of that period&mdash;maybe there would be some basis to his remarks. But I could not abide what the honourable member had to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) said, `We won'. That was the bottom line&mdash;`We won. We are here. We are doing it. You blokes can please yourselves'. That is what they say about the winners&mdash;`We can smile and the rest of you can please yourselves'. We will not talk about the fear, the deceit and the fact that the Labor Party's policies were pretty well non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about the adversarial nature of the union movement because the union movement relies on this adversarial notion. It relies on convincing people, through fear, that they must join them because they will save them from their bosses. I have experienced some pressure from employers, but not to the extent that warrants the excessive stuff that we hear from unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, I want to talk about a couple of old hands in the union movement: Charlie Fitzgibbon and Laurie Carmichael. Over the last 10 years or so, they have been talking about concentrating more on wealth creation, having a little less of this adversarial nonsense, and thinking about how the unions might try to give a fair go to all Australians&mdash;particularly our young people, among whom there is 30 per cent unemployment. As I have said, the union movement relies far too much on adversarial combat to promote its cause. I think that we should listen to those elder statesmen of the union movement&mdash;the Charlie Fitzgibbons and the Laurie Carmichaels&mdash;to make sure that we bring balance to the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was the honourable member for Lilley who mentioned the waste of the entrepreneurs in the 1980s; that somehow the squandering of this capital was to blame for some of the current problems that we face. We should not ever forget that it was under the ALP's financial policies of the last 10 years or so that these entrepreneurs flourished and eventually many of them flopped. Are we going to blame the $3.5 billion loss of the State Bank on those entrepreneurs? Surely not. Surely it has to be a shared responsibility between&mdash;and, being a former bank clerk and reflecting on the loss of that $3.5 billion and the opportunities that will not be there in South Australia that should be, it saddens me&mdash;the state government of the day, the management of the day, and, to a degree, the federal government. I understand that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), had a fair idea of some of the problems with the Reserve Bank well before they hit the light of day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party likes to talk about these entrepreneurs as though they are some scourge of the planet. The problem is that it does not offer any alternative. It was not that long ago&mdash;and I am old enough to remember&mdash;when many in the Labor Party saw the USSR and eastern Europe as their heroes. We do not hear that sort of enthusiasm these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about the Labor Party, I always enjoy going back about 10 years to a conversation with a former federal Labor minister. He talked about the problems of fixing wages and the issues of the employer-employee relationship. He had a call one day in Canberra from a minister, who will remain nameless, from a state, which will remain nameless. The union representative had an appointment with the minister. He turned up on the Monday or Tuesday morning and, hey presto, who should walk in with the union representative but the managing director of the company. Very soon, the minister found out that there was a nice little deal on offer, if he would be in it. To his eternal credit, he would not be in it. It is never quite as pure and as sweet as some would like to paint it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to my background. Maybe it would explain a little of my culture to the House and to those who might be participating in the debate. I come from small business, fundamentally, and I have employed a few people from time to time. I reached a point probably seven or eight years ago where I could not afford to employ people. The hassle was simply too great and the margins were too slim. I was in agriculture and we expect variations in business. However, the reality is, if employers are pushed too hard, if it is made too difficult for them to employ, and if incentives to employ are taken away, how in blazes are we going to get our young people back into work? Surely we should be looking at our employers and encouraging them as much as possible. Whether they are big, small or indifferent, right across the whole scale&mdash;particularly small business&mdash;surely we should be giving our employers every opportunity to employ. It is not just federal government, there are state governments involved in this as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to my theme of a politically selective process and touch on the wool reserve price scheme. Mr Speaker, you may well ask: how does that end up in the Industrial Relations Reform Bill? It goes like this: I accepted the wool reserve price scheme was based on the false expectations of the market. However, let us compare the way that was handled in the last few years with Australia's wage reserve price scheme known as the award system. As a wool grower, I and many of my colleagues returned to the open market with a 50, 70 or 80 per cent cut to prices which sent many of us to our financial end. We, as a parliament, insist that those who survived pay off the debt&mdash;interest and all&mdash;for their sins of being productive. Yet we maintain a labour system with one million unemployed and about one million underemployed. We pay billions of dollars to people who would prefer to work if the opportunity were there and a tax system and a whole range of processes in our various systems to ensure that they realise their full potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before honourable members opposite cry foul and start talking about the poor, the oppressed and the terrible coalition, I must say that I have only once, to my recollection, ever earned an above average wage&mdash;present times excluded. Recently, when I challenged a local AWU representative to work alongside me in any shearing shed at any time, his response was that his shearing skills may invoke the wrath of the RSPCA. So that contest never eventuated. I am a worker; I am a member of a union through choice. There are many times when I disagree with my union and it with me. I do believe in the advantages of group discussion and sharing the load, but I also believe in commonsense and realism as far as economic reality goes. I belong to the Liberal Party because it has a belief in the role of business, particularly small business. Presently, regional Australia is doing it tough in many areas and this budget has imposed a heavy load. The government's policy of deregulation in many other areas is imposing a heavier load. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's potential has to be the main responsibility of this parliament. I have no objection to minimum standards for employment. Those standards should be there and I think it is part of the civilised ethic which we should never lose. I acknowledge the Labor Party's strong tradition and heritage in that area, but it has been over the last 20 years that it got right out of kilter. There are senior unionists in this country who will tell you over a quiet beer that it got right out of kilter. What did it create? It created the sort of unemployment and the social issues we are facing now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, my questions to the government are: how many jobs will this legislation create? How many cheques have those opposite written from their own pockets to pay wages, create businesses and contribute to real economic wealth? How many jobs have Martin Ferguson and Bill Kelty created? Has anyone worked out how many jobs we have exported last year? Surely the only place employment can be created is in the business sector and through encouragement of the business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is too much hype, too much posturing and too much of a charade between the government and the ACTU. We have this talk tough, play the game attitude, but we come back and we have a more conservative approach than when we started and, sadly, fewer job opportunities. There is too much vested interest, too little national interest and too many lost opportunities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Reform Bill is designed to empower the major players in industrial relations. It places the onus upon those most acutely and centrally involved in the industrial relations process. This bill gives those players the opportunity to master their own destiny and to stimulate productivity, whilst maintaining the award safety net.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this bill that represents the best possible mix of motivation, self-determination, security and choice that our industrial relations system and its players could design. I suggest that the best possible way for me to depict the advantages of this bill is to use the example of the ACL Bearings Co. in my electorate of Bass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently represented the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) at a cheque presentation for $30,000 to ACL Bearings. That $30,000 represented the first instalment of a federal government grant. This company is the workplace of the future, and it is enterprises such as this that this bill supports. ACL Bearings has, in recent years, undergone very radical organisational changes at its own cost to ensure that it is in the best position to respond to the national and international economic climate, and I commend the company for its future projection and forward thinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considerable effort has been put into establishing an ongoing and effective consultative mechanism with employees. Its purpose has been to ensure that they are aware of the requirements of the marketplace, and to ensure that they can have input into the way the organisation addresses those requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an example of the workplace of the future. The entrenchment of consultative mechanisms between management and employees can only lead to more stable and efficient systems of workplace industrial relations. This program ensures that employees are not only involved in manufacture, but they also have input into how the company responds to the market for its products. ACL Bearings is a company that supplies automotive components to the domestic market and also to the highly competitive international market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australian enterprises to begin to maintain competitiveness nationally and internationally we need a sound system of industrial relations and workplace harmony. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill will guarantee this. Workplace reform contracts such as the one instituted at ACL Bearings mean that everyone involved in an enterprise has a stake in its national and international success. So how, one may ask, is this achieved? The enterprise agreement for ACL Bearings has now been agreed to by all unions on site, and has been submitted to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for ratification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the unions is incredibly important in this process. This agreement shows unionism at its best. It confirms the fact that unions are not only supportive of their members, but they are also supportive of the enterprises for which their members work. Enterprise agreements represent the removal of the old combative system of workplace industrial relations and its replacement by one which is consultative and team oriented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important aspects of this agreement is its training component&mdash;and I know all about training components. My own recent background lies in the training area, and I cannot overstate just how important it is to have ongoing training in companies to create a more work oriented workplace and to improve output. Training will be provided to the members of the ACL consultative committee and this will give to those involved skills to effectively undertake their functions in relation to monitoring plant performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Grey (Mr  Wakelin), noted that we need to have a fair go for all Australians, especially young people. I ask him where that fair go was in the coalition's suggestion that we should employ young people at a wage of $3 an hour. In my training background, I asked young people would they work for $3 an hour and they said, `No, definitely not'. That was slave labour. The opposition made a scurrilous suggestion, but fortunately on 13 March the people of Australia rejected it, and a lot of those people were young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At ACL Bearings all employees will be integrated into an effective team structure. I have personally been to ACL Bearings and I have seen how that mechanism is beginning. This means that employees no longer work in isolation; they are part of a team. They are efficient and, I might add, very motivated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the reasons why the government is so keen to support workplace reform contracts. Under this particular contract the federal government will provide $50,000 and the company will provide $90,000. I commend ACL Bearings. I commend its employees. I commend its unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is confidently expected that the outcome of this project will be of significant interest to private sector operations throughout Australia. This is the type of project that this government is endeavouring to motivate in the entire industrial relations sphere. This bill will make these projects commonplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The example of ACL Bearings shows what this bill is all about. This legislation is designed so that individual workplaces will have individual working conditions&mdash;conditions which will be to the benefit of the organisation, the workers and the unions. It will be of benefit to everyone concerned because industrial relations under this bill becomes flexible&mdash;a flexibility that has been unprecedented in the past. This bill seeks to create that flexibility. But, unlike the industrial relations policies of the coalition at the last election, this is a safe and secure flexibility rather than exploitive flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Grey sounded as if he had not really grasped what this bill is all about. The whole thrust of this bill is to encourage employers to employ, whilst still maintaining support for employees. That is our award safety net. Through this bill the award system will be strengthened and maintained, making sure that beneath any enterprise bargain a sound, secure, constantly revised and updated award system remains in place. This bill and our policy better the nation's system of industrial relations. The coalition policy would have smashed it. We would have been thrown back into an industrial dark age with division, combat and exploitation as its hallmarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem of industrial action is also dealt with by this bill. The movement towards a strong framework for bargaining has also necessitated dealing with industrial action in a similar manner. This bill will enable industrial action, including the basic right for workers to withdraw their labour during a bargaining period. What it will not allow is an action of a destructive nature, including wilful or reckless damage, personal injury or defamation. At the same time as this bill guarantees industrial rights, it also maintains industrial protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this bill represent? It is a dramatic, yet totally balanced and progressive change in the thrust and emphasis of our national industrial relations system. It represents a shift from a centralised to a decentralised system of industrial relations. It gives industrial relations back to its practitioners and allows the industrial relations system to reflect the attitude of each and every workplace. It is no longer monolithic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is the final step in achieving the perfect balance in industrial relations. It is motivational for workers and management, and stimulating to business and, therefore, the economy. Most of all, it is safe for employees, because the safety structure of awards will be enhanced and maintained. I commend such companies as ACL Bearings and congratulate the minister on this reform bill. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even if the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) does not understand, the community and the national media understand, and the government as a whole well knows&mdash;the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) knows it even better&mdash;the Industrial Relations Reform Bill represents a remarkable and political failure. The bill was to have been of enormous significance to the nation's economic future. When the minister first took office, he clearly recognised the importance of genuine labour market reforms for the future competitiveness of the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge of increased productivity is a primary concern in every economic sector, in the services, manufacturing, mining and resources sectors. The minister knew that when he embarked on this ambitious plan of reform; it remains commonsense. There is a broad, widely accepted understanding that if Australia is to pull itself towards a higher level of across-the-board global competitiveness, it is vital to address this issue of labour market flexibility at the level of enterprises, to provide enterprise based solutions to enterprise based problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government knows that meaningful reform of this kind is vital. I wish that were the only reform obstacle in the way of increased productivity; but it is not. Nevertheless, it is one of the biggest of the many remaining areas of reform and one which has long been sought after by all industries as it is by the many&mdash;especially the young&mdash;who are squeezed out of the labour market by the rigid award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As have other members, I have read the recent laments of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in the public media, that he fears the government and caucus are losing their reformist zeal. There is good cause to be worried by this insider's view of government. If the bill before the House represents the government's reformist drive at its best, the best the government can achieve at the height of its powers in this session of parliament, Australian industry may as well give up the ghost of achieving any real change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the budget, in which the community witnessed a marked additional increase in the cost structures bearing down on industry, most have already given up the hope of any substantive changes in industry settings. This is so despite the vague, generalised comments emanating from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) who is hunting around for a new industry policy to improve the efficiency of industry, a policy which&mdash;as a result of the bill before the House&mdash;does not have a hope of addressing the crucial contribution that labour market flexibility makes to market efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has not lived up to the ambitions of the Minister for Industrial Relations. There is no productivity dividend for the community; it will not feed through the business chain and lead to more efficient industries. All it does is spread the old, near criminal, combative, union based labour system even more persuasively than before. It is characteristic of the government that, when it gets caught in a corner and has to face up to unpalatable economic reality, it embraces the language of reform and runs a scare campaign against the real challenge of reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad, predictable response which demeans the nature of the debate and the many distinguished members of the community outside the parliament who participate in it. Even more importantly, it buries the crucial economic issues on which the future of industry hinge. With the legislation before the House and with the government's having failed to achieve its desired and much promoted level of change, we anticipate that the government will now proceed to misleadingly characterise the real task of labour market reform as a means of destroying workers' wages and conditions&mdash;and nothing more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than a key measure for locking in the productivity improvements and expanding growth and employment, the government will now claim real labour market change is a threat to existing jobs. This is an old game for the government; when in doubt make your failures your successes and exploit the old labour class divisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, the urgent need to create a flexible, decentralised, mature and sensible enterprise focused industrial relations system, which binds together the interests of the employer and employee, is shelved. Consequently, the bill extends the union driven award system into the non-unionised private sector, adds a new and complex layer of bureaucracy to the industrial relations system, decreases the legitimate opportunity for employers to seek protection against damaging third party union actions and represents a further push by the federal government to import foreign treaty clauses into Australia for the purposes of overriding state based industrial relations jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, the legislation is a political response to an issue at the hub of the economic challenges before our nation. There is nothing in the bill which meets its originally stated aim of providing genuine enterprise bargaining opportunities for the non-union sector. All the bill does is rigidify the existing institutional industrial relations arrangements and make a mockery of the need for flexibility and industry level bargaining. These matters are being made abundantly clear by countless commentators, as well as by other members on this side of the House who have contributed to the debate already&mdash;or will do so later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to extend my remarks into one important corner of the labour market which has been totally overlooked in the bill and utterly pushed aside by the government. It is the operation of the Coal Industry Tribunal and the moribund, insulated and uncompetitive system of industrial relations which operates across the coal industry. Before I proceed in detail, I will sketch some background on the coal industry and the industrial relation system which has evolved in that industry. It hardly needs to be said that the industry is a key export enterprise. The black coal sector employs over 25,000 people and produces some 180 million tonnes of black coal, of which about 126 million tonnes&mdash;over 70 per cent&mdash;is sold abroad at a value of $7 1/4 billion annually. That is about 12 per cent of the total merchandise export trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coal industry is more than a bit player in the national economy. It is the largest single commodity export earner in this country, and it represents one of the more technologically sophisticated and globally geared industries in the economy. The industrial relations arrangements within that industry, by contrast, are antiquated and serve only to shackle the industry as it strives to build its competitiveness. The industry has its own industry specific industrial relations system, which stands outside the mainstream of the current industrial relations arrangements. The industrial relations system within the coal industry operates through the Coal Industry Tribunal&mdash;a one-man board which, in conjunction with the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission and other lesser tribunals in Queensland and Tasmania, acts with virtually the same powers as the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tribunal was established under the Coal Industry Act 1946. Its roots reside in a period of Australian industrial history which is no longer relevant to contemporary needs. The Coal Industry Tribunal was established at a time when Australian coal production was directed almost exclusively at domestic consumption&mdash;electricity generation and steel manufacturing in the main, which were especially important for postwar reconstruction and development purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coal Industry Tribunal had, as its brief, the requirement to maintain domestic production levels in an industrial relations environment which was extremely volatile. The tribunal failed the test of the miners strike of 1949 and supply to vital industries was disrupted. As time passed and the industry shifted its focus from domestic supply to international marketing by the late 1950s, the Coal Industry Tribunal had already outlived its shelf life&mdash;if it ever had one to start with. But in the early 1990s, we are still stuck with this tribunal. Apart from its industrial relations system, the industry has changed dramatically over the past 50 years from when the Coal Industry Tribunal was first established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coalmining is now largely an open-cut activity and resembles quarrying in many respects. Underground mining constitutes the minority of mining activity&mdash;about 30 per cent of production and less than half of all employment. It is also being transformed by longwall mining technologies. Overall, the occupational health and safety standards associated with mining have improved dramatically, as would be expected of a modern industry, and the skill base to the mining industry has deepened greatly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, the coal industry&mdash;now almost exclusively internationalised&mdash;exports to the major global markets. As with farmers and others, the industry therefore is a price taker. It is a price taker in a market where, while volumes are projected to be up over the next decade, returns are down and are set to remain flat for some time to come. In this environment, the industry has to absorb costs and inefficiencies or else lose markets. Regrettably, because of the massive leakage in productivity through the industrial relations system, the price competitiveness of the coal industry is on the wane. Many of Australia's coal producers are looking at having to cut their coal prices by around $10 per tonne to stay competitive with alternative overseas suppliers. That is a price cut of around 20 per cent on their current selling prices. This is not just a useful market signal to rationalise the industry. That has already happened, and many of the non-longwall underground pits have already passed into history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are looking at here is for basically already competitive companies to grab every extra productivity gain they can to keep their place in the markets in the years to come. Apart from the costly and inefficient industrial relations system, there is not much fat left anywhere on the coal industry today. The industry has already embraced best practice in most of its operations, like other resource based companies which live and work in the global market. It has adopted a policy of across-the-board incremental improvements. It has pushed itself and continues to push the micro-reform agenda to win extra savings. Port costs have been cut with privatisation and other challenges remain in respect of rail freight costs and particularly so in labour productivity. The coal industry labour market is a real source of concern, and that cannot be concealed. It is a problem which will be made worse by the bill before the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of industrial disputation in the coal sector is still well above national averages. Back in 1988, the number of days lost to industrial dispute per 1,000 employees was&mdash;wait for it&mdash;15,548. It is now 2,970 per 1,000 employees. That is a great advance but still, when compared with the all-industry average of 158 days, it is appalling. Looked at in another way, the issue is even more sharply defined. The coalmining sector accounts for 0.3 per cent of the work force, but in 1991-92&mdash;one of its better industrial relations years&mdash;it accounted for 23 per cent of all industrial disputes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was 0.3 per cent of the work force which accounted for 23 per cent of all industrial disputes. If honourable members wanted an example of the coal sector industrial relations system at work, all they needed to have done was follow last September's disastrous strike over BHP coal contract prices. The Coal Industry Tribunal was powerless to control the United Mine Workers. The union openly brushed aside the one-man tribunal. Before various companies took section 45D remedies, and before injunctions requiring a return to work were issued, five days of production were lost. If the government does not think something is inherently wrong with the coal industry's industrial relations system which allows such events to unfold, and if it thinks the current arrangement which keeps that system frozen out of the mainstream labour system is of a beneficial state to either employers or employees, the community is in a deeper economic malaise than it thinks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial disputation is one thing. Consider the wages bill across the industry. Average weekly earnings in the industry are twice that of the national average. It might interest honourable members to know that the average weekly earnings in the industry amount to $1,230&mdash;about $60,000 per year. Even more important from a coal industry productivity point of view, coal industry earnings have totally outstripped industry productivity growth. These sorts of trends kill off industries, and this trend has afflicted the coal industry for a very long time. All the industry asks is that, if its preferred devolutionary industrial relations model is unacceptable to the accord partners who framed the bill now before the House, its current antiquated industrial relations system be absorbed within the national system. This is important for the future of the industry. It is equally important for the security of employment within the industry and for future job growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, growth in traded volumes of coal will continue. A good prospect is that, if the industry can increase its across-the-board productivity, it can expand. But equally so, competition from low-cost coal suppliers is fierce, and there is every chance the industry could drop by the wayside unless improvements are forthcoming. Whatever its goodwill, the Coal Industry Tribunal can do nothing to lock in labour productivity growth in the industry. Its former companion in the New South Wales coal labour relations field, the Joint Coal Board, has virtually ceased its role as an arbiter in the state industrial relations system. Now the day has come for the Coal Industry Tribunal as well. This is not a partisan perspective either. The last three major studies of the coal industry&mdash;the Hancock report of 1983, the Niland report of 1989 and the Industry Commission study of 1991&mdash;have all recommended the Coal Industry Tribunal be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Keeping the industry's industrial relations arrangements out in the cold does not do those in the labour force any good in the long term. It isolates them from the realities of the open market, which will ultimately determine whether or not they or their children continue to work in the industry. It restricts the flexibility of individual companies to respond to market challenges and hold their export positions or win new contract opportunities. It entrenches old industrial practices we all thought went out with the restructuring of the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is even more than this that is of concern to the industry. The level of industrial disputation in the industry is already draining the industry of its profitability. But the bill before the House will exacerbate the problem even more. In so far as the bill is about weakening the 45D and 45E provisions of the Trade Practices Act, transferring them into the new Australian Industrial Relations Act and, from there, for the final effect, to the labour court, then the coal industry has been placed at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as the coal industry is outside of the government's industrial relations system, under the bill the industry will have to attempt appeals across jurisdictions to win even weakened protection against secondary boycotts or to exercise its due common law remedies. This will not only prove time consuming, a factor which is absolutely critical in responding to secondary boycotts, but it is also doubtful that the industry will have the administrative platform to gain access to the relocated sections 45D and 45E in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this system had been in place at the time of last September's strike action, the industry could have been permanently incapacitated. Again, this all arises from the simple fact that the government has allowed a segmented, redundant industrial relations tribunal to run the coal industry into the ground. Yet again the industry may not believe what the government is doing in this bill is at all its preferred option, but if it can at least bring the coal sector's industrial relations arrangements in from out of the cold and link them with the national system, there is some hope for the industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, one of the most important pieces of legislation that has been before this parliament for a considerable time. The government's reforms provide the framework for the further spread of enterprise bargaining throughout the Australian economy and they build on the reforms of the last decade. Previous speakers on the other side of the House, of course, continue to argue that we are introducing legislation which will not be effective. I think they need to look at their own operations in order to see whether their own procedures are effective in relation to how the Australian people judge their position. We continue to sit on the government benches, they continue to sit on the opposition benches, and I am absolutely convinced that industrial relations was one of the major issues in the last election and that the people clearly made the decision that they wanted a Labor government to introduce legislation on these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms allow Australian workplaces to implement cooperatively and constructively the changes needed to compete with the best companies in the world. The legislation provides employers with the flexibility they need to improve productivity and compete internationally, while recognising that employee protection is crucial to the success of enterprise bargaining. The legislation clearly distinguishes between the bargaining stream, where an increasing number of workplaces will determine their actual wages and conditions, and the arbitrated award safety net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment on the safety net issue. A safety net of wages and conditions and a number of other employee protections are a fundamental part of the total legislative package, designed to protect workers' living standards. This is the issue that we are discussing here tonight, which is so important to the Australian community. Employee protections are important on social justice grounds and crucial to the success of enterprise bargaining. They increase the level of trust and cooperation between workers and employers, thus strengthening the commitment of the work force to productivity improvement. They also encourage workplace negotiations to focus on sustainable productivity improvements, rather than on one-off cuts to workers' wages and conditions, as is espoused by our opponents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is charged with ensuring that the award system provides secure, relevant and consistent awards. When deciding whether awards are relevant and consistent, the government intends that the commission will consider the objects and statements of the legislative intent included in this legislation. The government intends that the award framework will be maintained as an effective safety net to underpin enterprise bargaining. When setting safety net increases in wages and conditions&mdash;for example, through test cases&mdash;the public interest will still be particularly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In providing for consistency across awards, the government intends that the commission will maintain stable and appropriate relationships between job classifications. A key element of the wage system since 1989 has been the development of a framework of consistent minimum rates awards. The legislation will reflect and reinforce the importance of maintaining this framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation provides for paid rates awards to continue and be maintained in areas where employees' terms and conditions of employment have customarily been fixed in this way. However, if the integrity of such awards is not maintained, they will be able to be cancelled or varied appropriately. The government expects many parties on paid rates to progressively move to certified agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments are directed at making awards more streamlined and modern regulatory instruments. The commission must encourage the parties to awards to keep them up to date. Changes to legislation require the commission to review awards to make sure that they are simple, written in plain English and, where appropriate, meet the safety net requirements. This will assist in the removal of unnecessary and outdated provisions and allow for more flexibility in the application of awards and for keeping them up to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission will be encouraged to include enterprise flexibility clauses in each award. The award safety net will be extended by guaranteeing minimum entitlements to all workers&mdash;fair minimum wages, equal pay for work of equal value by men and women, rights to redundancy pay, protection against unfair dismissal and 12 months unpaid parental leave on a shared basis. The award safety net stream and the direct bargaining stream will be separately administered by the commission. The no disadvantage test that applies to certified agreements will continue to enable awards to act as benchmarks for certification and approval of agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enterprise bargaining is a very important part of the total package. The government's reform package supports fair and flexible enterprise bargaining, which promotes productivity and efficiency improvements at the workplace while protecting employees. Enterprise bargaining has already delivered significant benefits to Australia through improved productivity and a more cooperative workplace culture. These benefits have been clearly demonstrated in many areas of Australia and have proved more than evident in my electorate of McMillan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amcor, one of Australia's largest producers of paper products, and the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, the CFMEU, have recently signed an enterprise agreement, a significant milestone and a first for the pulp and paper industry. So it can be done and it will be done within the structures that we are legislating for. That agreement is a positive result of cooperation between employers and employees and has been developed over a period of five or six years. A further welcome development in my electorate has seen our great industry, based on power generation, also move positively towards enterprise agreements, which are crucial to the future prosperity of the area, all done within the administrative structures and the regulations introduced by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are areas that have been of great concern and need to be reflected upon. The no disadvantage test, for instance, provides workplaces with the flexibility to implement innovative reforms, including a wide range of variations to award conditions, while protecting employees. To access agreements, employees' terms and conditions of employment must first be covered by an award. The award and the relevant legislation will be the benchmark for the no disadvantage test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new legislation builds on the existing certified agreement provisions. Requirements covering dispute resolution procedures and consultation are enhanced. A certified agreement may now contain a provision that enables it to be varied under circumstances and in a way defined in the agreement. This will give greater incentive for longer term agreements. On their expiry, certified agreements continue to apply indefinitely as awards unless another award or agreement is made or the agreement is cancelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation provides new procedures for the variation of agreements after expiry. This will increase certainty and provide an incentive for the parties to negotiate further enterprise agreements. Enterprise flexibility agreements may be made directly between an employer and his or her employees. These provisions will use the corporations powers of the constitution. This makes them more widely accessible as the parties will not need to demonstrate an interstate industrial dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the no disadvantage test, enterprise flexibility agreements contain safe-guards to ensure that employees are protected. In this way we can ensure that a majority of employees must approve it. If unions respondent to the relevant award have members at the workplace they must be given an opportunity to take part in negotiations and to be party to any ensuing agreement. If they do not have members at the workplace relevant unions party to the award must be given an opportunity to be heard when the application for approval of the agreement is before the commission. However, the unions will have no right of veto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of the non-unionised employees, in that they may require further protection, the commission is able to refuse on public interest grounds to approve an agreement because of exceptional circumstances. Agreements are not to be taken to be contrary to the public interest merely because they are inconsistent with general principles established by the commission concerning awards. For enterprise flexibility agreements as well as certified agreements there must be no inducement or pressure on employees to leave a union, no discrimination on the ground of union membership, prohibition on dismissal or employment discrimination by reason only of refusing to agree to a proposed agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is extremely important to the total future of Australia and I fully support it. Other areas of concern about the total structure of negotiations on employment and industrial relations relate to many of the issues at the moment which are extremely important to the development of Australia and investment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We constantly hear opposition members in this House saying that, if wages could be reduced by some magical figure by abolishing the rights of workers, things would suddenly be okay. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me put to you a few other areas I believe are extremely important to the employment opportunities of Australians and the need for change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area that I represent in McMillan covers the Latrobe Valley which is one of the major energy generating areas in Australia. Just off the coast of the electorate of McMillan we have the major gas and oil reserves of Bass Strait. It is a crucial area of energy supply to Victoria and to the nation and, as such, will play an important part in the future development of the nation both nationally and internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I continually hear our opponents in this House talking about the fault of the worker, the need to reduce workers' wages, that we cannot have laws guaranteeing minimum wage rates, and that it should be possible to negotiate wage rates down to a minimum. Those arguments are red herrings. I listened to the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), my next-door neighbour since his electorate is just outside the Latrobe Valley region. His electorate covers the rural sectors of Gippsland, while the electorate I represent covers the industrial area and part of the rural area. The honourable member continually talks about the need for workers to pay the price of industrial reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big issue facing crucial areas of the nation, one of which I represent&mdash;I will continue to maintain this in every forum I possibly can&mdash;is that there are several areas of Australia today which have the capacity to compete with any area in the world. Any major investor that is looking to put a major manufacturing plant in our nation in preference to New Zealand or somewhere in South-East Asia need look no further than an area such as the Latrobe Valley. The one crucial factor that is missing is realistic pricing of our major products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We produce the energy on which Victoria operates and we produce energy which goes into the national grid; but our region is expected to subsidise the rest of Victoria and the rest of Australia. That power cannot be bought any cheaper 500 yards from the power station than it is 500 miles away. Some 10 or 12 years ago a major energy using plant was established at Portland in the Western District of Victoria. For that period of time the Victorian taxpayers have been subsidising the transmission costs of generating power to that power plant to the tune of $1,000 million, simply because the plant was put by our political opponents in an area where there was no power or energy, and I could never work out the reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have become absolutely convinced that we need to fight very hard now to ensure that the Latrobe Valley, the Hunter Valley, Gladstone in Queensland, perhaps Collie in Western Australia and other areas that have a natural advantage, are allowed to take advantage of that natural advantage. A major energy industry such as a smelter plant should not be located in an area like Portland in Victoria. It should be located right near the power station so that the power can be delivered at the cheapest possible price to enable that plant to be competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not develop these policies in the future those companies that wish to invest in this part of the world will certainly not invest in Australia. It is not the wages that are killing us. It is not this industrial relations issue. It is the basic fundamentals of cross-subsidies. There are no better operators of cross-subsidies in this parliament than members of the National Party of Australia. Due to the bargaining position it held in government over many years, the National Party has created situations in Australia where industry has been sadly disadvantaged for political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984, 1985 and 1986, in my electorate we ripped apart the subsidy structures of the dairy industry. Today we see that industry responding very effectively to the market forces, and it is the most prosperous industry in the rural sector in Australia today. We need the same situation developed for power, energy, electricity and gas. The boards of national and international companies will not make the required decisions about where to place their substantial investments of $300 million, $400 million, $600 million and $800 million until we develop the policies that are required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations is not the key issue. The key issue is the elimination of the cross-subsidies that do not allow those areas of Australia which have the natural advantages to compete against our Asian competitors and attract the investment to Australia. So I am getting a little sick and tired of hearing our opponents on the other side constantly talking about the need in industrial relations to somehow reduce wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its reports, the Industry Commission keeps coming up with the same theory. It does mention other issues of adjustment but it keeps on the same theme: if only wages could be adjusted this subsidy problem would be fixed. But that is not the answer. The answer lies in Australians realising that certain sectors of Australia have certain advantages through our natural resources which have to be put to use for the benefit of the nation. It means that if an area has a distinct advantage in where the supply of energy is derived from, that advantage should not be distorted by forcing the people in that region to pay the same price for that power as they would if they were 500 miles away, whether it be in Portland or Mildura. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the big issues we are debating now and the big issues that have to be fought through. Under the stewardship of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as Treasurer, this government set about the restructuring of Australia. Some people at the moment are starting to believe that perhaps the restructuring is causing too many problems. But I would make this plea in this parliament&mdash;and I will continue to make it in the forums of the political party that I belong to&mdash;that now is not the time to back off. Now is the time to finish the job, not to attack the working people of the nation. It is time to attack the structural problems that we still have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have gone through transport and we have worked through the waterfront. The two big issues that are still to be delivered to the Australian economy are our energy pricing for electricity and gas. My ambition in this parliament for the next 12 months is to work in every possible way to see that the benefits that can accrue to the Australian community do accrue from our natural benefits and that we do not have the workers being asked to take lower wages simply because some people want to keep subsidies in place which should not be there.

The overall result, the effect, is to render the new path to enterprise bargaining absolutely worthless. The involvement of unions will render proposals totally ineffective. That is dreadful. The government, if it were honest, would probably say that that was its intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The altered provisions mean that the push to accelerate our move from the arbitration system has now been abandoned. The government has dressed the legislation up in a lot of fancy, nice words, but the net result is that this government is encouraging a continuation of Australia's discredited industrial relations system. The enterprise flexibility agreements will not work because they will give unions too much involvement in the process. Small, non-unionised businesses will not risk drawing themselves to the unions' attention by seeking official ratification of the deals they have done with their workers. So the legislation will be ineffective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite correct. It will be very interesting to see whether the minister accepts the  amendments to be moved by my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong. No reasonable person in Australia should say that compulsory unionism is acceptable. If a person does not wish to join a union, that ought to be that person's democratic right in the Australia of 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secondary boycott provisions really have been very successful. The Fraser government introduced them. The shadow minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong, was responsible for the inclusion of those very important provisions in the law of Australia. That meant that unions were protected from lawless employers and employers were able to obtain protection from lawless unions. It was a fair situation. There was equality of treatment. There was equity. But the government is removing those provisions from the Trade Practices Act and putting them into the Industrial Relations Act&mdash;in other words, watering them down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also allowing a 72-hour delay before the provisions can be accessed. The reason is that unions want special deals. Many small businesses will not stay in business if they have to wait 72 hours before the new provisions are available. It is a tragedy. Instead of moving in the right direction, we are now moving in the wrong direction. The unions claimed that it was necessary to curb the legal remedies because of their interference&mdash;or alleged interference&mdash;with the rights of workers to withdraw their labour in pursuit of industrial objectives. In a civilised society we should all be held responsible for the consequences of our actions. If we do something resulting in another person sustaining a financial loss, then we would be sued, as we should be, in the ordinary courts of the land, because a citizen ought to have redress in the ordinary courts when the law is broken. But, sadly, the government wants to remove these secondary boycott provisions from the ordinary courts and pass them over to a kangaroo court&mdash;the new industrial relations court that will be set up at very great expense. It is a very unnecessary change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The unions want special deals and they know the ordinary law will not apply in the industrial relations court. It is very likely that the government will appoint many of its union cronies to the Industrial Relations Commission with the result that there will be travesties of justice. It will be criminal if ordinary businesses, ordinary employers and ordinary people are not able to have redress in the ordinary courts of the land. I get very suspicious when people are denied access to the ordinary courts. When these specialist tribunals, operating on a dubious basis, are set up justice may well not be seen to be done. That is a matter which I worry about, and I believe my colleagues and the nation share my concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the House dashes the very real hopes offered by the Prime Minister when a number of months ago he sought in a speech to the Institute of Directors to unveil the model of industrial relations. He said that we were working towards a situation where awards and arbitration would diminish in importance and where enterprise agreements would not be mere add-ons to awards but full substitutes for awards, which means that they would have to spread to non-unionised workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is a sad disappointment. Originally it may well have been the government's intention to bring in legislation as the Prime Minister suggested. However, he had not taken into account the fact that the ACTU would call for payment of its election debt. As surely as night follows day, we found the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations reacting to the dictates of the ACTU, and therefore this particularly useless piece of legislation being brought into the parliament. It does not move in the right direction; it moves in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the legislation is simply an indication that the Labor government is a government of the unions, by the unions, for the unions. This legislation is a complete and utter sell-out to the ACTU. It waters down the ban on secondary boycotts; it legislates for a right to strike; it protects unions against actions for damages under the common law; and it establishes a separate labour court. It is a payback to the ACTU for its election support. I am not suggesting that all unions are bad. Of course, unions are not bad. I believe that many unions seek to do the right thing by their members, but justice must not only be done but be seen to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation before the House is a travesty of justice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to enter the debate and to support the government's Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993, coming as it does after an election campaign in which industrial relations was one of the key issues before the people. One of the difficulties with debates of this sort in the chamber is that too many people on the opposition benches are stuck in a time warp.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), who has just spoken, is clearly one of those. His opening tirade of rhetoric really stemmed from the good old 1960s and 1970s knee-jerk reaction when employers and employees thought they had to stand toe to toe and slug it out until one of them fell over. That sort of 1960s and 1970s mentality which seems to permeate through some of the members of the opposition benches has been reflected in some of the contributions in the debate on this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that the honourable member for Fisher has lapsed into his old clothes&mdash;the old Queensland National Party clothes&mdash;that he was once proud to wear. The Queensland National Party government was fairly well renowned for its performance in industrial relations, the protection of civil liberties and the protection of the rights of individuals&mdash;a National Party of which at that time the honourable member for Fisher was proud to be a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, he has rather changed his suit these days; he has decided that the Liberal Party has a better chance of winning the seat in the growing urban areas of northern Brisbane. He is now a Liberally minded person, having shaken off those terrible shackles of the National Party days in Queensland. But it seems to me that he lapsed into a bit of that 1960s, 1970s conservative rhetoric as he tried to launch an attack on this bill. It really was a string of outdated cliches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time we exploded some of those outdated myths. Anyone who has followed closely the industrial relations situation in the last decade would know only too well the changing culture and the changing attitude amongst all practitioners on both sides of the arbitration table, on both sides of the negotiation table. Increasingly, it has been a negotiating table rather than an arbitration table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would commend to people on the other side of the House the sorts of comments that have been made by people involved in private business. In a number of industries, firms&mdash;some of which were renowned for having very poor industrial relations&mdash;are now participating in the best practice demonstration program. In the space of five years they have turned their problems around to now be regarded as being at the forefront. I think of companies like Goninan, a major metal fabrication shop which was renowned for difficult industrial relations in the 1970s and early 1980s. It is now regarded as one of the model metal shops in the country, a metal shop that has been transformed by agreements at the workshop floor level between employees and employers with unions involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recall before the last election addressing an industrial relations seminar in the Hunter Valley where there were representatives from Goninan present&mdash;management, workers and unions. The management, workers and union proudly stood there together to tell all of the participants&mdash;a mixed audience, some employers, some employees&mdash;of their turnaround in that company and the turnaround in their attitudes. That turnaround, the management at that seminar acknowledged, could not have occurred without the involvement of the union and, in fact, the union had been the catalyst for that dramatic change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of difference that industrial relations and good management is about in the 1990s. It is the sort of transformation which this government has been seriously putting in place over the last decade. It is lamentable that in industrial relations debates of this sort members of the opposition want to lapse into their 1960s and 1970s rhetoric and try to find new reds under the bed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are indeed some members of the opposition&mdash;and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is clearly one of them&mdash;who have followed the debate closely. I think that in his more earnest moments at night by himself he actually believes that what I say is true, even if it may not be the best line for him to run for his own purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to some of the key points of the bill before the parliament. The bill seeks to establish a new stream for enterprise agreements for establishing a basis of remuneration for workers in Australia. It differs markedly from the sort of enterprise agreement which was before the people as opposition policy at the last election. Our stream of enterprise bargaining included in this legislation is underpinned by an award system, a guarantee to all workers that they will not be exploited, that there will be a safety net of an award applying before an employer can decide to go off and seek to establish an enterprise agreement. Lamentably, there are still some employers who would seek to exploit their employees to the full extent of their opportunities rather than according to what might be reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill establishes a new stream underpinned by awards. It provides a number of safeguards for employees as well as opportunities for both employees and employers. In those enterprises in which there are some union members, those union members are entitled, as of right in this bill, to have their union representatives involved in the negotiations. And so they should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An employer who does not wish to discuss a condition of employment for union members with the union's representative is clearly not of a mind to strike a fair and reasonable bargain. The situation of an enterprise with no union members is also addressed in the bill. In those circumstances it is possible for the employer to negotiate an agreement directly with the employees. However, those agreements, whether they be in a unionised shop or a non-unionised shop, are required to be submitted to the commission for approval and scrutiny&mdash;and that is a proper and appropriate course to follow in a civilised society determined to ensure that there is equity and justice in the way in which people are treated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the bottom of the line, that is what we are talking about in industrial relations&mdash;the way in which people are treated in their work environment. That is a matter that should properly be the subject of some scrutiny by an independent body. It should not be a secret matter. It should not be the sort of secret enterprise agreement that the National Party in Queensland established some years ago under the Bjelke-Petersen government which was designed and promoted in an effort to reduce conditions of employment for workers and was then kept secret from all concerned. These documents under this legislation will be public documents, they will be open to scrutiny, and that is wholly appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Registered unions of employees and registered unions of employers that are party to the award in this industry will have the right to appear before the commission and will have the right to scrutinise the document to ensure that it is fair and reasonable and that it does not contravene the provisions of the act. The commission is required to take into account a number of things in determining whether or not to endorse the enterprise agreement under this new stream. The commission must be satisfied that there is no disadvantage as a whole to the benefits for those employees. The commission must be satisfied that there has been informed agreement of a majority of the workers to the proposal and additionally that there are no penalties for union members. In other words, as has happened in some other places, people cannot be put on differential pay rates; that is, a person in the union will not get paid less money than if he or she was not in the union. Those sorts of discriminatory actions are prohibited in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides flexibility and opportunities for employers, employees and unions to negotiate any variation in the conditions, provided the sum total of the variations does not push the conditions of those workers down. So we can have lateral changes and changes that improve the total package but we cannot have a change that pushes the total package down. That is the fundamental difference between the view on this side of the parliament and that on the opposition benches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no union veto in the process. I have heard a couple of speakers in this debate refer to the union veto. It is simply not there. It is absolute, patent nonsense. It is not in the bill; it is not in the new procedure. Anybody who wants to go and talk to union officials that have scrutinised the bill will know only too well that it is not in the bill. It is simply a furphy and those opposite should remove it from their repertoire in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at what the opposition's policy on this matter has been&mdash;not that there have been too many pronouncements on industrial relations or, for that matter, on any other area of policy since the election. The last time the opposition sought to make some statements about industrial relations, it was committed to individual contracts&mdash;not group enterprise agreements but individual contracts, one on one&mdash;with no right of representation, no protection for the workers. In fact, there was not even a right to go to the Industrial Relations Commission. Under the Fightback program that the opposition took to the people earlier this year, it denied workers access to the commission unless the employer agreed. That was its proposal; that is its brand of fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet those opposite have the hypocrisy to stand here and try to attack the government for introducing a bill which enshrines the rights of workers, whether or not they be in a union, to have their conditions fairly assessed by the Industrial Relations Commission. Of course, when it comes to industrial relations, we have the social laboratory of Victoria to give us some idea of what opposition policy would be in the federal sphere if those opposite had the opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian industrial relations policy, I was disappointed to see, was actually endorsed by the opposition. The opposition spokesperson for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong, was at the National Press Club in October last year talking about this; it was the week after the Victorian state election. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the election of a Liberal government in Victoria last Saturday . . . is a very significant development.</PARA>
<PARA>At that stage he was assuming that Australia would get a federal Liberal government to go with the newly elected Liberal state government in Victoria. He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . you will have governments sharing identical views, give or take a comma here or there, identical views on industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the words of the honourable member for Bennelong in October of last year, following the election of the Kennett government&mdash;a clear commitment that the policy of those opposite would do to Australia in industrial relations terms what Kennett's policy has done in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite keep talking in this and other debates about freedom of choice. Let me tell those opposite: we are going to provide a freedom of choice in systems. When this bill goes through, the people of Victoria will actually have a choice. If they think that Jeff Kennett's industrial relations package is as flash as those opposite seem to think it is, they will be quite happy to ignore this and stay with it. No-one is telling them they have to come under this new umbrella; they do not have to do that. But I tell you what: I would lay good money down on the table that that is exactly what the workers of Victoria will do; they will vote with their feet and leave the sort of draconian divisive industrial relations system which the policies of those opposite have generated in Victoria, and they will move in their hordes to federal awards to get coverage in this new enterprise agreement stream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Queensland National Party, for its part, made no secret of its policy a year or so ago. Last year, before the last election, the Queensland Nationals released a policy in which they were going to abolish the Queensland State Industrial Commission. So I wonder what the honourable member for Fisher or the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), who were in the chamber a little while ago, would think about that attitude from their own&mdash;I should not say `their own' in the case of the honourable member for Fisher; but from the National Party in Queensland&mdash;policy to abolish the Industrial Relations Commission: `Don't muck around with it; just get rid of it. Get it out of the way'. That is the sort of position which those opposite have been proud to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned on previous occasions the exploits of Troubleshooters Available; it is a fairly renowned outfit. A fellow called Graeme Haycroft is its chief operator. It is an organisation which has been publicly supported by the honourable member for Bennelong and also by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), in a video that the National Farmers Federation put out. In that video, they extolled the virtues of the Troubleshooters organisation. This Troubleshooters organisation in 1992 put out what it called a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Synopsis of labour-hire contracting system</EMPHASIS>. Under the heading, `What are the savings to employers?', it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The employer no longer has to worry about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. penalty rates . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Those opposite tell me they are not interested in reducing conditions of employment, but the opposition spokesperson on industrial relations and the shadow Attorney-General are on a public video endorsing this organisation which says in black and white, `If you tie in with us, you don't have to worry about penalty rates, the training guarantee levy, workers compensation, union superannuation, payroll tax, holiday pay, long service leave, sick leave, redundancy pay, group tax, and stupid union rules'. It will do away with holiday pay. It will get rid of long service leave; people should not have that. It will do away with sick leave. This is another thing that has been endorsed by the opposition spokesperson on industrial relations. Then it cites a few of these so-called stupid union rules: things like preference, seniority and maternity leave. Well, that is a pretty silly old rule, is it not: maternity leave; the thought that when a woman is pregnant she should actually get some leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wondered what the honourable member for Fisher was proposing when he was complaining about the minimum conditions we are inserting in this bill which provide for parental leave. What is he suggesting? Is he supporting the sort of Troubleshooters program so that, if women have children, they just lose their job? `No more work for you; we can't afford to employ you. The penalty for being pregnant is the sack!' That sounds pretty bizarre at the best of times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should remind ourselves that it was only 20 years ago&mdash;not a long time ago&mdash;that that was the practice followed by major employers, including governments, around this country. If a woman employed in the public service became pregnant she lost her job&mdash;end of story. Is that the sort of position the honourable member for Fisher is promoting? It is certainly the position which Troubleshooters is promoting&mdash;and Troubleshooters has been publicly endorsed by the opposition spokespeople on industrial relations. Of course, we would then do away with paternity leave as well&mdash;if we do away with maternity leave we might as well do away with paternity leave into the bargain. So it goes on. We would not have to worry about unfair dismissals either if we were to go down the Troubleshooters track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of industrial relations outcome that the opposition has supported publicly on the record. When opposition members tell us that they are really not about pushing wages down but are really about freedom and the rights of the individual, no-one believes them. The people of Australia did not believe them at the last election either. Any doubt about these sorts of things was cleared up some time ago when the shadow spokesperson on industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong, made it quite plain that he thought we should increase the hours of work. He actually argued that the government should be making an application to the industrial commission to increase the standard number of hours worked to 40 hours. Then, by some strange twist of logic, he said that increasing the number of hours that existing employees worked without increasing their pay was going to improve the employment position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no magic criteria or results which hang off a particular system. It is people who make the system work. This government has been about getting people together in a cooperative way in the area of industrial relations in order to produce results for them and for the nation. If there is any doubt about that, I refer to an article on this topic written by Ross Gittins&mdash;who is probably not a great friend of the government&mdash;a couple of years ago. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan has company bargaining and an amazingly good productivity record. America has company bargaining, but a record on productivity growth that's worse than ours. Germany has an enviable productivity record, but a system of centralised collective bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA>Those opposite who want to paint a picture which says that individual contracts or free bargaining situations produce greater productivity, fly in the face of the facts and the experiences of countries around the world. They should strip away that sort of sham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minute remaining, I will quickly mention some of the minimum conditions that we are including in this bill using our foreign affairs powers. There is a minimum wage for all Australians&mdash;as there should be. Using ILO convention 100, we are providing, by law, equal pay for equal work. There will be no discrimination on the basis of sex, and nor should there be. There is protection against unfair dismissal. Parental leave of up to 52 weeks will be, by law, a right for all Australians&mdash;and I am pleased to say that this includes parents adopting children. </PARA>

In that book he draws on his experiences as the shadow industrial relations spokesman, including the drawing up of the enterprise agreements policy in 1985 together with the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I had the honour of being the chairman of the backbench committee during those years when enterprise agreements were the source of great argument in this parliament, amongst the industrial relations club and amongst all those practitioners of industrial relations&mdash;the union movement and the employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the foresight of the honourable member for Bennelong and Neil Brown in developing those arguments and changing the culture of industrial relations in Australia forever. For the first time in some 90 years there was an attitude that we could move away from the award system and that at the enterprise level agreements could be reached between management and the work force to increase productivity, to increase job satisfaction and, in an all-round sense, to improve the productivity of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the House to a couple of those examples. In the case of the ICI Botany plant, which is well documented, enterprise agreements were entered into and annualised salaries replaced overtime arrangements, shift premiums and penalty rates. Employees were put into semi-autonomous teams to provide shift cover in the case of absence. Performance and productivity measures were included. There was a strong commitment to skills formation. That was the basis of the enterprise agreement. There was an arrangement between the work force and the company to make these changes. The Botany plant, as the honourable member for Brisbane would understand, had a long history of difficulties in the labour relations area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, in the Alcoa plant in Victoria in recent times the management negotiated with the work force to come up with an arrangement whereby the working week was increased to 40 hours from 38, but the working week was three or four days, according to the shift pattern. In that factory the work force was prepared to adapt to a set of arrangements that were compatible with their lifestyle and with the production of aluminium from that plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when the world moves to a more decentralised model, this government is centralising the power of the industrial relations agreements and the power of the trade union movement. The government is entrenching the power of that group at a time when everyone around the world has agreed that the focus should be at the enterprise level and that that is the way to increase productivity and increase employment opportunities. At a time when, under this government, we have 11.2 per cent unemployment, or 982,000 persons unemployed, we have these sets of industrial relations arrangements in place. America, where there is a more flexible arrangement, has seven per cent unemployment. </PARA>

I am sure that honourable members and people concerned about industrial relations will be interested in the well-known example of SPC based at Shepparton, which is mentioned in the same publication. In that enterprise agreement, which saved the financial future of that company, the following 11 points were agreed to between the work force and the management. These points made a number of changes in the way in which that company operated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, they removed the four rostered days off for all employees during the harvest season of January to April 1991. Second, they suspended weekend penalty rates. Third, they applied sick leave provisions for the metal industry award to seasonal employees covered by the Food Preservers Union. Fourth, they removed crib and meal allowances. Fifth, they reduced afternoon shift loading to 15 per cent. Sixth, they removed additional rest breaks. Seventh, they removed over-award payment to seasonal workers. Eighth, they required electronic funds transfer for all employees. Ninth, they required supervisory staff to perform hands-on work as required. Tenth, they removed the holiday loading of 17 per cent for staff not covered by industrial awards. Eleventh, they required staff to work 10 Saturdays or Sundays. These arrangements were supported by 93 per cent of the work force. Those changes in conditions had a very big impact on the profitability of the company, the wage structure, the on-costs and the work practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have examples of what enterprise bargaining has achieved in the workplace and now we have a bill before this parliament which has horrendous implications. Whilst the government and the government's spokesmen&mdash;through rhetoric&mdash;support the opposition's position on enterprise agreements, the reality is that this bill will create some considerable problems once it is passed. Let us look at the external affairs power. This parliament and this nation will be forever more guided&mdash;if I can put it that way&mdash;by the terms and conditions laid down by the International Labour Organisation that is based in Geneva. Anyone in this House, and anyone with an understanding of that organisation, would know that some of the resolutions and activities of the ILO leave a lot to be desired. Some of the countries advocating certain minimum standards in their own backyards are not any great example, especially for Australia. They have put up the minimum conditions of equal pay for equal work&mdash;which is the sort of thing that is now happening in Australia&mdash;and special conditions surrounding the termination of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise the whole issue of the ILO. Who sets the standards? Who would allow it to apply these standards to the Australian set of conditions? At least the arbitration commission was historically an Australian institution which set basic wage conditions emanating from this parliament and from a lot of ongoing discussion about wages, terms and conditions. The sovereignty of this parliament and this nation has been overruled by the activities of the ILO. As an employer of labour, I know that it is only too easy to put a person on the payroll, but much more difficult to terminate his or her employment if times get tough or there is a change of arrangements. All companies have a similar problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a proposition that if there are 15 or more employees in a company then the company has to go into dialogue with the union and the CES and have a long discussion about any termination arrangements for its employees for bona fide reasons. Does it encourage employment opportunities throughout Australia if people know that at the end of the day in a change of economic circumstances they will have to almost get permission to lay people off because of economics?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, enterprise agreements are the way to go in the change of culture. The break-out in wages in 1974-75 and 1981-82 under a centralised wage fixing system was the basis of a leapfrogging arrangement of over-award payments. This House and everyone who is interested in industrial relations should fully understand that enterprise agreements should be based on the new environment that we face in Australia after the deregulation of the Australian dollar in 1983 and that labour rates in Australia, plus their oncosts, are now comparable to those of other industrialised nations. No longer can we hide behind the excuse that we are insular and we are different. Wages, like other costs in the manufacturing of products, affect whether or not we have internationally competitive structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about achieving enterprise flexibility agreements&mdash;an interesting set of words. Under the proposal of the shadow minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong, enterprise agreements were quite easy to set up. On the one hand, the boss had a talk to his personnel on the shop floor and they came to personalised arrangements. As the shadow minister has gone to great pains to demonstrate to honourable members opposite, that was the fundamental arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this bill, anyone setting up an enterprise flexibility agreement&mdash;that little word `flexibility' is included just to try to persuade the world that it is more flexible than it really is&mdash;has 13 hurdles to jump to get it in place.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first case, parties must establish respondency to a federal award. In an enterprise agreement, some part of the outfit must respond to some part of the federal award. Secondly, parties must comply with the award system safety net; that is, a basic wage in terms and conditions. We have no problem with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, parties must comply with the new legislated minimum standards based on International Labour Organisation conventions and recommendations. We totally reject the proposition that some organisation in Geneva can set the terms and conditions in Melbourne, Sydney, Marble Bar or Perth. That is an outrageous proposition that will not stand up in this parliament or in any state parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth step is that parties must comply with the bargaining-in-good-faith directives of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. What does that mean? An enterprise agreement in which the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will give a directive of good faith. The fifth step is that agreements must comply with the public interest test. I challenge the government to define what `public interest' really means. That in itself creates a legal conundrum about what public interest means in the Australian context and within the Australian setting of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seventh step is that the agreement must comply with the no disadvantage test. That is an interesting set of words. What that really means is that any agreement made in regional Australia&mdash;as I indicated, referring to the Industry Commission report&mdash;must not interfere with any existing award arrangements. So there can be no flexibility and there can be no change; there can just be an ongoing domination by the award union arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eighth step is that unions which do not have any members at the particular workplace but which are respondents to the applicable federal award must be notified and given the opportunity to argue against approval of the agreement by the Industrial Relations Commission. So unions which have nothing to do with the particular workplace must be informed. They have a say in it. Even if the agreement has been directly reached between employees and management, the unions are still able to have a say in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the interesting example at Bondswear in Taree. A vast majority of the clothing plant's 60 employees agreed in a secret ballot that a new workplace agreement which reduced penalty rates but compensated them in other ways would help save their jobs. The union would not agree with that but, inevitably, it was persuaded that it should be allowed. The union wanted to interfere. That was a well-known case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 10th step is that the IRC must be satisfied that all employees to be covered by the agreement have been properly informed about the agreement. Again the union movement is interfering with this enterprise agreement. The 11th step is that it must be established that a majority of the employees to be covered by the agreement generally consent to the agreement. Again we have the union making sure of these preconditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 12th step says that it must be established that there has been no pressure exerted on or inducement extended to any employee to leave a union. That is all very well, but what about the very important proposition that the bill is silent about&mdash;the right not to join a union. The shadow minister at the table made a very strong case about the ability of workers not to join a union and to be free from coercion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if all these 12 hurdles were cleared, the agreement could still be subjected to an Industrial Relations Commission review if it were thought to be operating unfairly. So we have a situation where the so-called enterprise agreements are subject to all these conditions by a union movement which is in a very powerful position. On 17 October 1993 the Business Council of Australia was very upfront about its view when it was talking about an urgent need to free up competitive forces in the Australian economy. In a section of its press release the Business Council of Australia had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, we need to come to grips with real reform of our labour market. The third report of the Employee Relations Study Commission `Working Relations' sets out a practical path to improved competition within the labour market through facilitating genuine and effective enterprise bargaining as the primary vehicle for introducing workplace change and wage rate increases.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the view of the Business Council of  Australia about genuine enterprise agreements. I move on to a couple of other very important matters in this bill. I refer to the matter of secondary boycotts in sections 45D and 45E. In 1977 the shadow minister at the table was instrumental in introducing this measure. It has been most helpful in bringing to heel some of those rogue unions which, on occasions, wanted to use strongarm tactics. The threat of action against secondary boycotts through the use of section 45D has been a very important feature in maintaining some sense and balance within the trade union movement. The threat of real common law action has been used successfully in some of the more outrageous secondary boycotts by the union movement, such as in the case of Mudginberri. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a lot of concern about the 72-hour breathing period. If there is substantial injustice, there is the hope that the Industrial Relations Commission may help. With regard to the size of unions, we have a remarkable turnaround by the government. The government was advocating mega-unions of 10,000 members or more; now it is happy to advocate union membership of 100. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill entrenches union power and has ILO conventions as minimum standards. It is a 200-page bill of very complex industrial law. It places the unions in an uneven position compared with the employers. I support the foreshadowed amendment to be moved by the shadow minister that the bill should contain the right not to join a trade union if a worker so desires. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today there was a remarkable situation inasmuch as people from around Australia met in the council of the National Farmers Federation for the purpose of considering various matters, and one of those was the Mabo legislation. Mr Blight and Mr Rick Farley informed us from a national perspective. They have issued a news release which is headed `NFF Supports the Mabo Package'. Since we have had some comment about this matter in this House today, it might be a good idea to state exactly the NFF resolution, which was said to be unanimous. It decided:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)A national response to resolving Mabo issues is desirable.</PARA>
<PARA>That could hardly be said to be absolute support for the Keating government proposition. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)Complementary Commonwealth/State/Territory legislation to validate existing title is desirable.</PARA>
<PARA>That of course is not the case. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has made it very clear that he intends to trample all over what Western Australia thinks is a necessary solution. It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)Existing title must be validated as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA>I must state the view that I think when the Commonwealth legislation gets before the High Court, as it will, the major issue will be whether the Commonwealth has ever had the power to validate someone's land title. Of course, the Prime Minister has told us in this place that he cannot really validate valid title and that, of course, in the normal processes of the law it could be subject to legal claim. The NFF resolution continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d)There should be no revival of native title on the expiry of a pastoral lease.</PARA>
<PARA>That has been mentioned in the legislation, but it is not exactly true either. Further, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e)There should be no exposure to any compensation claim by landholders with existing title.</PARA>
<PARA>We do not know exactly what that will be, but we do know that in the legislation persons can be called upon to pay compensation. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f)Legal costs of landholders joined in Mabo claims should be met by the Crown (Commonwealth or State).</PARA>
<PARA>The legislation of course does not provide for that but provides that the Attorney-General may, considering the circumstances of the defendant, do so. Mr Farley tried to convince me personally that he had a letter from the Prime Minister guaranteeing that such funding would be available. I would like to see the Prime Minister say that. In fact, Mr Farley himself started to duck and dive on that issue in the end and argue that the only real promise it had of that was that it would have one person on the committee deciding whether people who are subject to these claims and have to use their own resources might get government help. Finally it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(g)Normal State/Territory laws in relation to land management must apply to native title land and native title equivalent.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the legislation allows for that. They are the grounds on which Mr Farley, a paid executive officer of the NFF, and his boss, the rice grower Graham Blight, give themselves the right to say that the NFF supports the Mabo package. It is an outrageous statement. Of course, it has severely embarrassed the representatives from Western Australia, who are very supportive of the Court legislation, are very much opposed to the Keating legislation and who did no more than agree to those motherhood statements, if you like. It gave no authority, in my view, for Mr Farley or Mr Blight to make the claims they have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me add to that. In questioning I have established beyond doubt that during the whole intense period of the negotiations there was no formal meeting of the NFF Aboriginal affairs committee. Its chairman was overseas for a substantial period of it and the NFF has become a joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am writing to all my constituent bodies in the only completely rural electorate left in Australia advising that there is no further advantage in being a paid-up member of the NFF. I will work assiduously to see that the Western Australian branches remove themselves from this organisation, which has become just a tool of Canberra and no longer represents the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I had longer, I would give other lengthy examples of where the NFF has failed people such as wheat growers&mdash;sold them out on the guaranteed minimum price so it could get a two per cent levy on wheat. These are the problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to deal with two matters relating to the topic of war. Firstly, I would just like to correct a couple of points from the speech I made in the adjournment debate on 18 August of this year with respect to the massacre of Australian troops on the island of Ambon in 1942. In that speech I stated the names of Japanese soldiers. I stated the family names second, in the English style rather than in the Japanese style. I also stated that Hatakeyama Kunito and Nakagowa Kenichi were sentenced to 20 years gaol on 14 July 1947 and 17 July 1947 respectively. In fact, they were tried together between these two dates and sentenced on the latter date together. I add one other point; that is, that Yamashita Kyusuke was involved in two trials&mdash;one on 7 August 1950 and one on 8 September 1950&mdash;and was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer now to a more contemporary matter, the very serious problem of the remaining mines in Cambodia&mdash;another tragic situation arising from warfare in our region. The United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia is in the process of withdrawing from that country after the elections. It is estimated that there are 10 million anti-personnel mines in Cambodia. The approach of the United Nations to dealing with this problem was to train Cambodian deminers. Over 2,000 people have been trained, approximately 40 demining teams being put into the field. It is acknowledged that roughly another two years is required for the management supervision of those demining teams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now a serious risk that the process of demining Cambodia will not continue with the same degree of effort that was envisaged, and that the people employed by the Cambodian Mine Action Centre will be laid off because of a lack of funding. As is well known, the mines maim and kill up to 300 people per month. Cambodia has the highest proportion of amputees in the world. There are also indirect economic consequences arising from problems associated with access to land, because of the lack of knowledge about the presence of mines and the obvious risk to people caused by the widespread presence of mines in many rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Kingdom based Mines Advisory Group has indicated that without a solution to the problem of widespread mine presence in Cambodia, long-term economic development in that country is not feasible. This problem is yet another classic and tragic illustration of the difficulties the international arms trade causes for underdeveloped countries, including some countries in our region, and how massive tragedy has been fuelled by the contest between the wealthy Western nations to sell weapons of mass destruction and slaughter to underdeveloped countries. It also shows how the struggling economies in many of these areas are further distorted by the competing power groups involved devoting more and more of their limited resources and output to the purchase of arms. I urge honourable members on both sides of the House to give urgent consideration to the role Australia can continue to play in the limitation of the production and export of arms throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear, whether we look at the Iran-Iraq war or at the more recent conflicts in continents such as Africa, Asia and Central America, that these conflicts have been seriously exacerbated by the fact that major weapons of mass destruction are made available as a result of intense competition between Western manufacturers of those arms. The end result of that process is an even greater degree of tragedy, slaughter and misery for the populations of the countries involved. </PARA>
