<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1993 which is before the House this morning represents yet another failure in the government's assets sales program. The government has come to privatisation in the first place in an altogether tawdry way. We have had promises over the years that the government would not be selling off this, that or the other. We have had Labor members running around the country assuring vested interest groups that these public bodies would be well and truly kept in public ownership throughout the term of the Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, over the years, we have seen the government back down little bit by little bit, privatisation by privatisation, until it has come to what the opposition was saying all along, and that is that there are commercial assets that are held by government, and operated by government, that need not be owned by government. Indeed, some of those commercial operations, if privatised, can be operated much more effectively, much more efficiently, with better services and with lower costs than they can if they are kept in public ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government came to privatisation, it came not for the right reasons, but for altogether the wrong ones. This was not a government that sat down and said, `Here we are operating commercial services. Here we are with something in public ownership that could be just as well run by the private sector&mdash;indeed, better run by the private sector'. It was not a government that sat down and said, as we did, that ordinary Australians should be offered an income stake in some of these commercial enterprises; that they should be given a share in the income generation and the capital appreciation; that they should be given a stake in the ownership of these national assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has come to privatisation for altogether the wrong reasons. It is a simple accounting exercise that has led the government into privatisation&mdash;basically an attempt to try to get money; an attempt to sell off silver to get money to put into recurrent revenue to make sure that the government can mask the real financial problems that it has with its budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who can forget the opposition to the coalition's program on the Commonwealth Bank privatisation during the 1990 election? I can well remember going to a rally addressed by the then Leader of the Opposition at National Mutual Square where officers from the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association turned up with great placards saying, `Vote for Labor. Make sure the Commonwealth Bank is never privatised'. We can probably all remember that the former member for Hindmarsh, John Scott, had a wonderful sign in his window saying, `Which bank should never be sold for 30 pieces of silver?'. We can all remember the campaign promises that were being made back then. Of course, after the election the government found a tawdry excuse for floating 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. It was supposed to be done because of the inefficiency and the financial incompetence of the Kirner government. It was a case of getting rid of the State Bank of Victoria and shelving it into the Commonwealth Bank. We were given assurances even then that that 30 per cent would be the only part of the Commonwealth Bank that was privatised. Now we find that we have another 19 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank coming on stream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why the government does this on a piecemeal basis. If it has come to the conclusion that the Commonwealth Bank is operating a commercial service in full competition with other banks, why can it not operate on the same basis? Why do we have to go through this death of a thousand cuts as the government reverses its position and, bit by bit, comes to what is economically necessary and inevitable&mdash;and, what is more, practically right? The government is now looking carefully at Telecom; it will be given the same sort of treatment. A reason will be thought of why there should be part privatisation of Telecom. A reason will be found why there should be a bit more. People in the Labor leadership are looking longingly at Telecom, thinking that Telecom could be the next golden nest egg to try to right their financial troubles. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Will they? We have said that Telecom should be privatised&mdash;not for the wrong reasons, but for the right ones. Irrespective of the financial mismanagement and the dreadful position the government has got the budget into, Telecom is now a commercial service operating in competition with Optus. There is no reason why the government should own one and not the other and no reason why average Australians should not have the opportunity to take a stake in Telecom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor leadership, which is looking lovingly at privatising Telecom, has to soften up its caucus and national council before it can do so. But I make a prediction that that, unquestionably, will come onto the list. All the Telecom unions that have been campaigning so hard for the government, on the basis that Telecom would not be privatised, will be placed in exactly the same position as the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association that campaigned so hard for the government's re-election on the basis that it would not privatise the Commonwealth Bank. But it did&mdash;and it will do so again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same thing happened with Australian Airlines and Qantas. Although the government had said that there was no justification for the privatisation of Australian Airlines or Qantas, after an election was out of the way, the political points were over and caucus and the national council had been softened up, we suddenly found that all the arguments had changed. The coalition had been right; it was better to have commercial airlines operating on a proper commercial footing in the private sector in full competition with other private sector airlines. In June 1992 the government announced that Qantas would purchase 100 per cent of Australian Airlines and the merged airline would be fully privatised. In November 1992 the government introduced the Qantas Sale Bill in both houses to give effect to the decision to privatise Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill received the support of the coalition. After all, it was our policy. It was assented to on 21 December 1992. There was a very interesting clause in that Qantas Sale Bill. It said that those parts of the act that had not come into effect would lapse on 31 December 1993. Do honourable members know why? It was there so that the government could hold itself to a timetable to get the Qantas float onto the market completed by 31 December 1993. It even put a legislative check on itself to make sure that that sale went through. The reason we have this amending bill today is that yet again the government has failed. The government had said it would be all over by 31 December 1993; the act would lapse on that day if the process had not been completed. But now, in September 1993, we have been asked to extend it until 30 June 1995. This is yet another failure by a government which was dragged kicking and screaming into the process in the first place. This is another failure that the parliament has to correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act provided for the full sale of Qantas in the 1993-94 financial year. The sale was planned in two parts, a trade sale of 25 per cent and a public float of the remaining 75 per cent. The trade sale was completed on 10 March 1993, with British Airways purchasing the 25 per cent holding for $665 million. On 2 July 1993, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) announced that the government had decided to reschedule the float which, according to the statute, had to be completed by December 1993 and that, instead, the government would bring forward the Commonwealth Bank sale. Honourable members should remember that the Commonwealth Bank was never going to be sold either. That measure has been brought forward to try to raise $1.6 billion for the deficit hole. It is selling off the family silver to try to cover current expenses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is just as well that the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) is not the Earl of Dartmouth or some British aristocrat. He would sell off the family castle to try to cover gambling debts. This is the policy that the government has been following; sell off the family silver, put it into recurrent assets and watch the money dissipate. At the end of the day, rather than retiring debt or treating a capital sale as a capital repayment, the government grabs the money, puts it into recurrent expenditure and Australia is worse off. At the end of the day we have lost a capital asset; we have not reduced our capital liabilities. All we have done is spent it&mdash;and every Australian is poorer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we go on to other spending commitments; that is why we go on to another asset privatisation. By the time the government has finished this process, we will have lost capital assets and we will not have reduced our debt or our capital account&mdash;all we will have seen is the money effectively burned up in financial recklessness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had this Friday afternoon special from the Minister for Finance. He really specialises in the Friday afternoon press release, generally after the network television deadlines have closed. He had another Friday afternoon special to say that the long vaunted, long awaited, much publicised, greatly heralded Qantas sale, which was to be completed by December 1993&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;was not going to happen and was to be deferred until the 1994-95 financial year. This immediately created the problem that we hear about today. The legislation had provided that the sale had to be over by December. So we come back to the parliament with another failure under our belt, another failure in an assets sale, back here to amend a piece of legislation that the government could not even hold for about two years. We are back here trying to amend it all again and trying to pretend that the government's assets sales program is on track. I tell the government: if it is on track, it is on a road between Gundagai and Holbrook&mdash;somewhere out in a place where it was never expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose an investor seeing the government assets sales program would sit back looking bemusedly at all of this. I do not think investors would be working overtime to make sure that they were ready and prepared for a government assets sale, because they are bound to be disappointed. The international investors and the broking houses must have walked down the aisle to consummate with the government on asset sales so many times that they have been utterly frustrated and disappointed. They are going to find it hard to walk down that aisle with all seriousness again. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's incompetent bungling over this sale is indicative of the utter failure of its assets sales program generally. The government's assets sales program has never met a single target in any financial year. Three strikes and the government is out. The 1990-91 budget forecast that the government would receive $1 billion for assets sales. Do honourable members know what it received? It received $161 million&mdash;about one-tenth of the return on its planned assets sales. In the 1991-92 budget forecast, the government said that it would receive $625 million from assets sales. Do honourable members know what it got? The government paid out $300 million. It did not get anything; it actually paid out in that year. After saying that it was going to get $625 million, it actually shovelled out $300 million on these wonderfully planned assets sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the government's forecasts are getting better. In last year's budget, the government said that it might get $1.6 billion and it got $800 million. That is not bad. It nearly got 50 per cent of what it forecasted in last year's budget. Can the government tell me who will believe that it will get its $2.4 billion this year? Who is going to believe it? Three strikes and the government is out. The government has not met one target in the last three years. All the government does is pull out these numbers. It probably gets them from some computer deep in the bowels of the Department of Finance, which is probably driven not by any practicalities of what the government thinks it will get, but by what it needs to make the budget's bottom line look better. We get this figure of $2.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major part of that will come from the Commonwealth Bank, which the government was not going to extend the privatisation of in any case. That is why we sit back and say that Telecom is going to come. There is nothing surer. When we do not make this $2.4 billion, we will be back here next year saying that the government has suddenly seen a ray of light. Telecom will be back on. There will be a huge figure and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) will be able to say, `Look how well I am doing. I am getting the budget deficit under control'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst aspect of this asset sales failure is that it is being used to mask and cover another of the government's financial disasters&mdash;the budget deficit. Every year the government treats planned asset sales as negative outlays. It announces a planned asset sale and says, `There you go, that is revenue in next year's budget'. The government says that this year we will have $2.4 billion of asset sales and that we can then put that into our account and show that as $2.4 billion of revenue. Look how much better that makes the government's budgetary deficit. This is nothing more than an elaborate ploy to mask the real financial failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made some inquiries of the Department of Finance to try to find out what world best practice is and whether other governments are selling off the silver and treating this as negative outlays or revenue, as income for the current year. The Department of Finance has not been able to tell us yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some questions on notice to try to find out how this is being treated. If a private company were selling off an asset, that would be shown on the balance sheet. Assets at the start of the financial year and at the end of the financial year would be shown on the balance sheet. The sale of a capital asset would be shown as an item on the balance sheet. A private company would not show an asset sale going into profit and loss with no corresponding entry. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe) must remember double entry accounting from his accounting days: if something is put on one side of the ledger, it is brought to the other side of the ledger; something by the window, something by the door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government takes out a capital asset and shows it as revenue but there is no corresponding entry to show that it has run down its assets or capital stock. That is because the government does not create a balance sheet. The way in which this government accounts for asset sales is all one way. The wonderful thing about it is that the government then takes that into account and says, `This is really going to help our budget deficit'. If the government is really going to look at the underlying budget deficit, it should not take the capital items into account. When the government says, `We have only got a $16 billion deficit', under normal accounting procedures it cannot claim $2.4 billion of planned asset sales off that. The real budget deficit starts at about $18.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is saying in relation to its budget deficit, `This year, as part of our deficit reducing program, we are going to increase the deficit'. That is the old trick of saying, `We are going to reduce the deficit by increasing it; we are going to go from Sydney to Melbourne by going to Brisbane'. The government already has the deficit at $16 billion, but these planned asset sales have to be added back on, which will take the deficit to about $18 billion. This blows the government budget deficit as a proportion of GDP over the four per cent, back to the levels of the Whitlam government deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has planned a few other funny tricks in relation to its budget deficit. It has Reserve Bank abnormal profits in there and increased dividends from government business enterprises. If they are taken out, as the private sector financial forecasters are saying, this budget deficit could be, in real underlying terms, as high as $23 billion, which will put the government's budget deficit at a level worse than that of the Whitlam government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wants to compare this budget deficit with the Whitlam government deficit asset sales cannot be taken into account. Even Gough was not flogging off the family silver to make his budget deficit better. He did not have that program; he did not have those items in his budget deficit. This government has taken something that has never been treated before, whacked it in and then tried to compare itself historically. The government has to compare itself historically and take out those abnormal one-off items. It proves that this government is back to the levels of financial profligacy, mismanagement and incompetence of Whitlam. `Dawkins greater than Whitlam' will probably appear on his tombstone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least it could be said that Whitlam had the decency to sack Cairns over his incompetence. But what can be said about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)? The Prime Minister has the indecency to fail to take any action in relation to financial mismanagement which is as bad, if not worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In cumulative terms, the effect of all of these budget deficits is that the government is running up debt. It is running up debt every year that it increases these budget deficits. If we add them up, we get a deterioration in the finances of the Commonwealth. The cumulative deficit over the past three years is in the order of $40 billion. It has deteriorated by $57 billion since 1989-90. Even if the government meets its targets, whatever those targets may now be, and I will come back to that in a moment&mdash;</PARA>

Then, when the budget came down, it became 1.1 per cent by 1996-97. Then, when the sales taxes and the wine taxes looked as though they were in deep trouble, it became 1.2 per cent by 1996-97. We have never seen such a moving target in all our lives. If this were an archery competition, those opposite would be thrown out for cheating. Every time the government has set a target so it can actually be measured, it is moved. It is like one of those chickens that people try to shoot at the show. This is a moveable budget deficit feast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why the government put the target out to 1996-97 is that it knows that that will be after the next election and government members will not be held accountable in this parliament. That is a lovely trick. They have made sure they are offering a target that they will never actually be responsible for bringing in. They have done that because they have no confidence&mdash;the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have no confidence&mdash;that that target will ever be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look very carefully at the budget forecast we see that it is the same old trick; it is not even a new trick. The growth figures are inflated down the years so the government can say that the economy will boom and it will all come in. Have we not heard this before? We heard exactly the same story in relation to the One Nation statement. We were going to have four per cent growth by 1992-93; the place was going to go gangbusters and the budget was going to self-repair. Have we not heard all this before?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the Treasurer is making the claim that the Australian economy is booming, but the proof comes in the budget figures. If the Australian economy is booming and if we are now in a period of sustained economic growth, why is our budget deficit going to be worse this current financial year than it was last year? If the Australian economy were recovering, the budget deficit, through the automatic stabilisers, would be coming back and there would be no need to pump prime. The government deficit would be reducing in this year if we were really out of recession and there would be no need to run historical deficits in the order of the 1981-82 or 1974-75 recessions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absolute truth comes when we look at the financial figures and see that these are inflated claims. We are supposed to be two years out of recession and going along well. The only trouble is that the budget deficit gets worse, and it gets less worse only because the government does this fiddle in relation to asset sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a private company sells off assets and puts the receipts into recurrent expenditure to mask its operating or trading position it is generally an infallible sign that receivership is on the way. That is exactly the point at which the receivers say, `We are not seeing any operating profit here but we are watching assets start to disappear'. That is the point at which receivers move in to protect their assets. The government is doing exactly the same sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is the government doing this in relation to the trading account but it is also being done in relation to the budget figures, which is even worse. If a private company makes profit or trading projections in the financial markets which happen to be wrong, it can be sued for false and misleading advertising in its prospectus. A private company carries out huge due diligence checks to make sure that it always conservatively understates what its trading and financial position will be. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that, when the government set forth the process for the Qantas float, it aimed for a date of 31 December this year. But the government said at the time that the float would depend upon the state of the financial markets, and the honourable member for Higgins knows that very well. The government said that, if there was a need to defer the float, it would defer it. So this legislation sets a later date.

I will come to the reasons why the government decided on the float because the honourable member for Higgins did not touch on those reasons. The government's prime responsibility is to maximise the return, not to plug a hole in the deficit. It is to enable a capitalisation of the airline which has been acknowledged as necessary by everybody for the last 10 years. I will turn to that matter in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been three major changes in aviation policy in this country in the last five years. Let us look at decisions taken by this federal Labor government, a number of which could have been taken at any time in the previous 20 years by the conservatives when they were in power. The first and uppermost decision was to deregulate the domestic airline industry in Australia to bring about genuine competition between Ansett and Australian Airlines, or Qantas Australian as it is now known, and to open up options for other airlines to enter the fray.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that single decision we have seen substantial investment by the airlines in new infrastructure. Regrettably, we have seen the coming and going of Compass but the introduction of competition produced substantial reductions in air fares and a remarkable variety in timetables and options for consumers that were not available before. Flowing from that we have now seen a further restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first decision that we took and the one that set this whole process in motion was the decision to bring about competition in domestic aviation in Australia. The second decision that was taken was the decision to merge Qantas with Australian Airlines. For the first time a government said that it has never made any sense for two wholly owned government airlines not to have a working partnership with each other. Most people would say that the decision to enable Qantas to buy Australian Airlines and, by that process, merge was long overdue commonsense, and I would agree with that; it should have happened much earlier. But that merger has provided a dramatic strength for both government airlines in the lead-up to the public float of Qantas, which I will come to in a minute. It has given Australian Airlines an international partner to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other change in aviation policy was to enable Ansett to take an international partner as well. Ansett is in the process of forming a partnership with a number of airlines. This is necessary for the health of our domestic airlines. It should be remembered that 80 per cent of air travel in Australia is by people flying on domestic airlines. It is necessary for them to have strategic relationships with the international airlines serving Australia. It made eminent sense for Qantas and Australian Airlines to merge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having done that, we come to the question: why are we floating Qantas? Why has the privatisation of Qantas been set in motion? It is not, as the honourable member for Higgins said, simply to raise money to plug a hole in the budget. It was done because the government's advice from the boards and the management of all of our airlines was that international aviation had changed. It has changed in the sense that each of the major carriers has now formed strategic alliances with various companies as part of global networks. To leave Qantas sitting out there by itself and not allowing it to take a substantial partner would have been grossly irresponsible because it would have simply shrunk; it would have been rolled over the top. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was necessary to find Qantas a partner; and boy, did we find Qantas a partner. We found British Airways as the principal bidder prepared to take&mdash;not to buy Qantas, as some people have thought&mdash;a 25 per cent strategic exchange. That has given British Airways and Qantas, very interestingly, a complete global network. If we wander around to the Qantas travel agency in Parliament House and look at the latest product called `Global Explorer', we will see a brand new ticket option available through Qantas and British Airways which enables a person to go one way around the world for $2,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should take them around to the agency and help them out. Of course, that was sensible. Why has the decision been taken to float? There are two key reasons. It was not taken because of some inane, Thatcherite privatisation policy because the private sector can do better, in order to flog the government assets and take the dough. In fact, the privatisation of Qantas was worked through the ALP national conference for two principal reasons: first, to enable the taking of the strategic partner, and that is what has happened with British Airways; secondly, there was a recognition that the airline could not continue to operate on borrowed funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas's capital structure at the moment is such that its aircraft are paid for by borrowings. Many of its assets in airports around the world have been paid for by borrowings. It was necessary to inject capital into Qantas. The way to inject capital is either for the government to supply it, as the shareholder, or to float the airline and raise the capital on the stock markets from the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the key point. The key point behind the float was not to sell the airline to some multimillionaire who wants to own an airline or to half a dozen of them who want to form a consortium, but to run a float so that thousands of ordinary Australians can buy small shareholdings, as they did in the Commonwealth Bank float. That guarantees Qantas a dramatic market presence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same success formula used by British Airways in Britain and by Singapore Airlines in Singapore&mdash;to float to the citizens of the country of which the airline is the national carrier, to raise the capital, to reduce the debt, so that, instead of paying back interest, Qantas is investing in modern generation aircraft, new service facilities, improving its profit and improving the dividend to the shareholder. Those are the reasons. It is not, as was presented by Mr silver-tongued lawyer, the honourable member for Higgins, some kind of desperate grab by the government to raise some money to plug a budget hole; in fact it was done to capitalise the airline and give it the opportunity to expand, in the global network in its partnership with British Airways, as part of the world's premier aviation structure. The government is proud to have set this in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why not float now? The simple reason is that there are a number of major floats going on in the Australian stock market. Woolworths recently completed a float. That was an interesting case and a highly successful one. The Commonwealth Bank at the moment is running another major float. It, too, will be an interesting and successful one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would anybody in his or her right mind put a couple of billion dollars worth of Qantas shares into a market that is absorbing those shares when the government's prime responsibility is to achieve the highest possible return? We will wait until we believe the market is ready for the Qantas float. We will guarantee the owners of Qantas, the people of Australia, the best possible result from the capitalisation of Qantas. The honourable member for Higgins made a fair bit of the accounting of these matters. I agree with him on the surface. That is how lawyers like to present things&mdash;on the surface. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I never have been, and I am proud to say that I never was one. Thank goodness! There are too many of them in here. Some hold the view that in normal accounting practice an asset is not sold and counted as revenue. Of course that is not done in normal company practice. But in government enterprises and in government budgets, not only in Australia but all around the world, capital expenditure appears as an outlay and as a revenue item. When we announced in the One Nation statement in January last year that there were $2.4 billion worth of capital works around Australia, nobody in the parliament said that investment in assets could not be counted as an outlay. Of course it is an outlay. When a government commits itself to capital works programs, it is counted in the outlays each year. When a government sells assets and draws the revenue in, it is counted in the revenue. Honourable members opposite know that; our lawyer friend may not understand it. Perhaps the opposition can talk to him about that issue later on and make sure that he understands it. It is a slick point, but it does not show much understanding of the government's budgetary process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this legislation represents a deferral of the float of Qantas. It is obvious that the government will wear some criticism of that, because it is true that the economy has not recovered as quickly as we had anticipated, and the market is not yet ready for the float in the form that we had anticipated. But in terms of the comments made by the honourable member for Higgins about the budgetary process and his nitpicking about whether the deficit represents 1.1 or 1.2 per cent of GDP in four years time, in my view that is pretty irrelevant. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has publicly demonstrated, without drawing any criticism to what he has had to say&mdash;and he has been to a number of significant international meetings and conferences with heads of state&mdash;that, by world scale, Australia is in probably the most favourable position as a country at which an investor would look. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inflation is down in the very low single digit figures&mdash;not where those lot opposite left it, at over 10 per cent, double digit inflation. Interest rates are at the lowest levels for 30 years. They are back at the levels we were borrowing at when we were starting with our first homes, just as our kids are probably starting now. They are at very low levels by historical standards. This government has shown in its last cycle a commitment to investing in infrastructure projects to ensure that the value adding benefits are coming through the Australian economy now. The companies winning export markets will have the transport systems to deliver their products, the waterfront has been cleaned up, and airport structures have been invested in and fixed up. The airlines are servicing Australia in a way that has not been seen before. The tourist industry is focusing on Australia&mdash;and I have not even bothered to mention the potential of what is going to happen in the year 2000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Qantas Sale Amendment Bill is living proof of the old adage: if you want something stuffed up, get the government involved. Despite the words we have just heard from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe), the reality is that the whole process of the sale of Qantas has been a sad and sorry story from day one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real tragedy of the Qantas sale is simply that we are about five years behind the times now and blowing out to seven years. If the parliamentary secretary really looked at the situation, he would see that the optimum time to have floated Qantas was undoubtedly in 1988-89 when the airline was in a very difficult situation, the economy was bubbling along and there was money to be had in a boom time. The fact that we have had deferral after deferral means that we have missed the boat for optimising the effect that Qantas could have in a world sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say that lightly because presently most airlines are in deep recession, there are no yields and, while passenger numbers are up, nobody is making any money. We have a situation where there are attempts to form global alliances and where the biggest aviation nation in the world, the United States, is looking at ways of saving a crippled industry. In this country, we have an airline grossly disadvantaged by the government's failure to go ahead with the privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary is quite right: one of the great tragedies was that Qantas was undercapitalised for years. It was the fault of people on both sides of this House that Qantas was never really given that chance. For years Qantas has been begging for privatisation so that it can get out in the market and build itself up into a real global force. While the opposition is not opposing this bill, and while I think there is probably a realisation now that this is not the time to float, the real tragedy is that we have fallen behind the times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a couple of comments about the world situation on aviation at the moment because it is really quite interesting. President Clinton's commission on the whole of the aviation industry causes me some concern, because I think we are going to look toward a retraction of the American attitude towards international rights, and we will see a more protectionist attitude from the United States. A similar thing is happening with European airlines now. At the moment, discussions are being held on the possibility of the formation of a major European aviation bloc. What happens if we go off the whole area of bilateral negotiations for aviation rights and we move into a multilateral situation, and we have these blocs banging their heads against each other?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our part of the world, the Asia-Pacific region&mdash;which is going to be the largest growing aviation sector&mdash;a couple of things could well happen. I think the Japanese, for example, will probably be strong enough to stand up on their own and take the blocs on. The ASEAN countries could well form their own bloc. If we have not got our act together, we are going to be stuck as the tail at the end of the world, with not very much say in how things go on at all. I say that notwithstanding the fact that we now have this alliance, or part-ownership, with British Airways. In Australia we have to make some very quick and tough decisions as to how we are going to play that future aviation policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advent of the British Airways acquisition of 25 per cent of Qantas stock has helped, and there have been some advantages in getting that alliance into place. But that is not the be all and end all. We have to be very careful that we are not squeezed out into being part of the end of the line of world aviation and miss some of the opportunities that are going to be available for some of these big conglomerates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was one thing that the parliamentary secretary did not mention in terms of the so-called achievements of government aviation policy, and that is what is going on at the moment with the deregulation of the trans-Tasman area. That is supposed to be in place now. The advent of that common market over the Tasman has some enormous advantages. It has even more enormous advantages if we can spread it out a bit and look towards a south-west Pacific bloc, or group, being formed. That has advantages for us, and it has some real advantages for the small Pacific island states. We should be looking at this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be fully cognisant of the fact that we now do have some international competition in terms of the international aviation services. The IASC's awarding of international rights to Ansett is ultimately going to have advantages. But, even that has been a bit late. It has come at a time when Ansett has had its own financial problems. Ansett is going through a period of recapitalisation so that it can service some of the routes that it has been granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real worry in some sectors of the aviation industry that Qantas may be disadvantaged. I do not believe that is necessarily so. With the growth that we are going to see in aviation in the Asia-Pacific region over the next decade, there are going to be quite a few opportunities if we get our act together and go in there and plough that market. There will be opportunities for both Ansett and the Qantas group to do particularly well. We are really heartened by some of the projections on the growth of tourism in the Asia-Pacific region. The world tourism organisation is talking about 140 million Asian people travelling offshore on annual leave by the year 2000. If Australia can get one per cent of that business, the international airlines operating in and out of Australia are going to have to triple their capacity. We must look very seriously at the future direction of our aviation policy over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that I believe the physical privatisation of Qantas should have happened five years ago. Qantas would have been in a much better position now if that had been the case. While there are some very great advantages in bringing Qantas and Australian Airlines together as one entity, that in itself has probably put even longer delays in the privatisation process reaching its optimum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways decided to amalgamate in the early 1970s, it took about seven or eight years before the two airlines really came together. At the moment there are difficulties in bringing Qantas and Australian Airlines together. Much has been achieved so far, but it is still not all a bed of roses. It is going to take quite a bit of settling down. I am a little concerned for the worth of the Qantas-Australian group if we cannot really get that together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary referred to Mrs Thatcher just flogging off the airline, but the story of British Airways was quite an amazing one. It was a moribund monster that very few people seemed to want to fly with. I think the general attitude in Australia was that BOAC stood for `better on a camel', rather than an airline, and people tried to avoid it. The year before privatisation BOAC had losses of about #276 million. Within 12 to 18 months of privatisation it was turned around to a highly profitable airline, and one of the most successful in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pure reasons for privatisation were present there, but one of the great successes of British Airways privatisation was that optimum staff share ownership was ensured. The airline was opened up and the staff were brought in and involved. Almost overnight, when the staff became shareholders, there was a complete change of attitude. The staff knew that the service that they were providing was going to determine whether they were going to get a decent return on their shares for that particular year. Somebody from British Airways&mdash;who will remain nameless&mdash;told me that one of the difficulties was that it could never get its staff to retire; they were shareholders, it was their business and they were going to stay there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that, when Qantas is 100 per cent privatised, we make maximum staff ownership an essential of the Australian operation, because that is one of the secrets of it. We have some lessons to learn from the trans-Tasman business. One of the great successes in our part of the world has been the privatisation of Air New Zealand. Air New Zealand is not a big company in world aviation terms at all, but the difference in that operation after privatisation was really quite outstanding. Whilst airlines around the world are announcing vastly reduced profits, or huge losses, in its last year of operation Air New Zealand came out with a profit in excess of $NZ100 million. Many of the silly work practices were  improved under privatisation, the airline was capitalised properly, and innovative management came in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Air New Zealand operation now is quite outstanding in some of the things it has done. We do not have to be frightened of this&mdash;it should be encouraged because it is very much to Australia's advantage&mdash;but there is an argument about whether Australia gave New Zealand too much in allowing it to pick up passengers in Australia and fly beyond. This was part of the deal made when trying to get the aviation market into place. The reality is that a privatised, innovative and entrepreneurial Air New Zealand took that with both hands and is doing extremely well with it. Examples are its traffic from Taipei into Brisbane and on to Auckland and the fact that it has already identified the Korean and Thailand markets as areas to plough. It has been very smart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just hope that once Qantas is fully privatised the same entrepreneurial spirit will develop. Qantas has some tremendous advantages over a small airline such as Air New Zealand and could do quite well. One of Qantas's real difficulties is that, until it can be 100 per cent privatised, it will have its old culture. That must change if the airline is to optimise its opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another reason privatisation should have happened five years ago lies in what has happened to Qantas in the interim. Partly because of the policies of this government, particularly with salary caps, wage freezes and deals done through union agreements with the accord&mdash;it is a real tragedy&mdash;there was a decision not to allow any increases in salaries for technical staff. We had the amazing situation a few years ago of Qantas having to take its maintenance offshore and have companies such as United Airlines, Aer Lingus and Japan Airlines do a lot of its servicing, because we lost a lot of our great technical expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When wages were frozen it was quite easy for aircraft maintenance people to get Qantas engineers and technical staff to work in such places as Hong Kong for huge amounts of money. Qantas then employed Chinese maintenance people from Hong Kong to work here. It was a very sad period of Australian aviation history when that was allowed to happen. Qantas assured me that if it had been a private company at the time that would not have happened. In fact, Ansett was able to keep its staff; but Qantas had to abide by government provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few years government caps have curtailed the amount of money that could be paid to people appointed as chief executive officers to Qantas. There are classic tales of Qantas CEOs being offered sums of $135,000 to $150,000 a year when the chief executive officers of some American airlines were being paid $2 million a year&mdash;and $800,000 a year was not an odd figure around the Asia-Pacific rim. Despite all the disadvantages that Qantas has had over the years of being a government owned instrumentality, in many respects it has done a lot better than many would have thought possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the government is right, in terms of maximising the value of that airline, in deferring the sale process for an additional two years. The two years will give an opportunity for the amalgamation of Australian Airlines and Qantas to settle down. One would hope the world situation will improve so that yields on the international scene will allow some profitability. I repeat the hope that when we finally see Qantas sold off and a fully privatised Qantas emerge there will be an optimum availability of shares for staff to make sure Qantas can best meet its potential. The tragedy is that this did not happen five years ago and that we have missed out on some of the great advantages that privatisation could have given Qantas. We hope that the decision that we all make here today&mdash;we are not opposing this legislation&mdash;will allow Qantas to achieve optimum value as soon as possible and allow Qantas to rule its own life and maintain its position as one of the great airlines of the world. </PARA>

Over the years their attitude and expressions consistently have been anti an Australian international airline industry. They would have flogged off anything and everything they could, had they been in government. Hearing them evincing concern about Qantas is a new experience for me.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier speakers, and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) in his second reading speech, made the point that the government's decision to reschedule the float of Qantas to 1994-95 was made on the basis of advice from financial consultants and the department. The international airline industry is depressed. There is a responsibility to taxpayers&mdash;to all Australians&mdash;to ensure that there is a maximum return to Australians as a whole, and to government, from the float of Qantas. The other need for the legislation is to ensure that we protect the rights of Qantas employees, given that the existing act provided for that during the transitional period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the former chief executive of Qantas, John Ward. He led that organisation through trying and difficult times. He steered it through the challenging task of restructuring the organisation and through the amalgamation with Australian Airlines. He has to be given credit for the considerable productivity growth over recent years from that restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had the extremely difficult task of amalgamating a major domestic airline with Qantas, which is oriented internationally. Both airlines fly aeroplanes and have pilots, but the equipment was different, their sales markets were different and their maintenance equipment was different. Whilst considerable benefits can be gained from having one large organisation, the task of going through the process of amalgamation is difficult. Qantas is a multibillion dollar business. In that business, John Ward carried out the hands-on task of the amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas carried on over many years the hands-on task of promoting Australia when it was not fashionable to do so. In effect, for many years the only promotion of Australia outside Australia was carried on by Qantas advertising and promoting its services and Australia as a destination. I share the view of the honourable member for Fadden that this multibillion dollar business has been undercapitalised for years by successive governments. That has always been a problem and it comes from the Sir Humphreys in this place and their own policy that there ought not to be a role for public sector enterprises. They achieved that result over the years of denying capital or providing advice that results in those kinds of decisions, despite the best efforts of ministers, whoever they may have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something that that organisation has had to struggle with. It resulted in the organisation having to carry a debt servicing burden that, in normal commercial circumstances, would not have been there to be serviced. So I wish Mr Ward well in whatever career he adopts in the years ahead. He has made a major contribution to the development of Qantas and to Australia's international airline services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have a concern that the participation of British Airways in Qantas must result in a significant improvement and a significant benefit to Australia and to Qantas. The acquisition of the 25 per cent shareholding by BA in Qantas should not result in the tail wagging the dog. BA's reputation for brashness and for pushiness is well known around the world. If we look at some of the media companies, we find that a 15 per cent shareholding can be seen as having a controlling interest or a major influential interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, there is a 25 per cent shareholding in Australia's flag carrier. The management of Qantas, its board, this government and future governments will have to be vigilant and firm to ensure that that shareholding by BA&mdash;welcome as it is&mdash;proves to be of benefit to Australia and to Qantas, and that the tail does not start to wag the dog so that Qantas then becomes simply a subsidiary of British Airways in management terms. The subsequent sale of the remainder of Qantas, together with BA's 25 per cent shareholding, should give Qantas the financial capacity to combat the growing consolidation of international airlines and the intense competition that exists and that lies ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at an international airline market into this country in which the top 10 carriers in the year to May 1993 carried 83 per cent of the passengers. So, in that kind of market, it is likely to further consolidate to fewer major players. It is a tough market, and in that market we have to make sure that Qantas is operating as an organisation in the best interests of Australia and not of foreign shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the market we see that, in the year ended May 1993, almost 10 million international passengers came into Australia. The top 10 carriers I referred to carried 83 per cent of that total passenger market. This is down a little on the previous year ending May 1992 of 83.6 per cent, but within those figures we see considerable improvements in traffic into Australia. Overall, 9.67 million passengers came into or went out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth on the routes, such as the Los Angeles-Sydney route, is to be qualified a little because there is some doubt about the accuracy of the figures. But it is reasonable enough to say that it was in the order of a 22 per cent increase in the year ended May 1992. The Honolulu-Sydney route had an increase of 31.1 per cent, partly because of the withdrawal of American carriers. Again, those figures are subject to later confirmation but they would be pretty much the order of the day. If we look at the figures for air traffic, with the exception of the Tokyo-Sydney and Auckland-Melbourne routes, we can see growth and improvement in all those figures and overall an increase of some 7.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go back to the appropriateness of the time of floating Qantas. We are in a period of intensive international airline competition. It is tough times in the industry, and we look at national reports of what is happening in the international airline industry. We look to Europe. `Crisis for European airlines' is one headline I am looking at. Another headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> is `Losing their way'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like vapour trails across the sky, the tangle that airlines have got themselves into seems never-ending. There may be a way to unravel their problems. But because airlines are battered and weary from the industry's worst-ever decline, there is a danger that the opportunity will be missed.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement is referring essentially to the European airlines but, with their connections into the market we are operating, it has significance for us. We need also to remember that the major international airline travel market&mdash;particularly into Europe&mdash;still has not recovered from the Gulf War and it is being succeeded by the world recession. So trade is extremely difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, if we look across to the Asian scene, we see that the Asian airlines are going to have to look to how efficiently they operate their businesses and the fact that yield in those airlines is going down, not going up. In relation to Asian airline routes, the former chief of Taiwan's China Airlines used to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Intercontinental&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning intercontinental airline services&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is for show, regional is for making dough.</PARA>
<PARA>That goes to the point that many national flag carriers operate for reasons quite unrelated to commercial success or to commercial profit. An international flag carrier is a national show piece. It is their shop window, and they have to have an international airline. But the comment `intercontinental is for show, regional is for making dough'&mdash;regional being Asia&mdash;succinctly describes the practice and the situation within the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we turn to what is happening in the case of Cathay Pacific, we see that it is particularly concerned about the declining yields in international air services. The Managing Director said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless yields improve, the industry is just not viable. If the decline in yields goes into 1994, some regional carriers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Asian carriers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will move into the red.</PARA>
<PARA>We see in the figures for the year ended 31 March last, Japan Airlines&mdash;JAL&mdash;had a pre-tax loss of some $US496 million. So Asian airlines overall&mdash;our growing market, our growing area of activity and a growing focus for Qantas&mdash;are finding it increasingly difficult. Yields are dropping, the number of passengers is increasing but the demand that is burgeoning for airline seats is almost all for heavily discounted, economy class seats, and the business and first-class travel have not picked up appreciably since the Gulf War of early 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose we could say that it is a bit like carrying more passengers for less profit or for profitless prosperity. There is another way of describing it, and that is to refer to it as carrying passengers for practice. They carry more passengers but are making less money out of it. If we look at the performance of Qantas&mdash;I have tried to describe something of the market and the way the market is operating, the depressed state that it is in, that profitless prosperity&mdash;and look at the top 10 profit-making airlines of the world in 1992, at the top of that list was Cathay Pacific with $US391 million; British Airways with $US309.8 million; China Airways, with $US143.3 million; Thai Airways with $US120.4 million; and Qantas is ranked fifth with $US106.6 million. These are the 1992 figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five of the top profit-making airlines were Asian airlines but, if we turn to the top 10 loss makers, five of them were United States airlines, and I will come to the United States in a few minutes. Five of the top 10 loss makers in the world were US airlines, headed by Delta Air Lines with a loss of $US564.8 million; American Airlines, $US475 million; United Airlines, $US417 million; Northwest Airlines, $US405.1 million; and the US Air Group, $US404.1 million. Down the bottom of the chart is Japan Airlines with an after tax loss of $US349.3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to the situation with regard to the US airlines. We see from those figures that five of the top 10 loss makers in the international airline business are US airlines. US airlines and the US government have been putting enormous pressure upon Australia to lay down and allow US airlines to intrude in Australian routes, the Australia-Japan route particularly. In my view, that approval should never have been given to Northwest Airlines, but that is the personal opinion of one member of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the US airlines have the device, through chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, to run up their debt and then seek virtually a moratorium from all of that debt. Under chapter 11 bankruptcy they can step aside from that debt, go back into the market with a much lower cost structure and further set about eroding the market. In that process, they then take on the very bullyboy kind of approach we saw in the recent negotiations between Australia and the US in respect of the Northwest route from  Sydney to Osaka and then to the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That behaviour by the US is not new. At the end of World War II the United States and the United Kingdom virtually carved up the world airline market between them. The US has been negotiating on and off with the Japanese government over many years trying to address what the Japanese see as the unequal US-Japan air service agreement, an agreement drawn up at the time of General MacArthur which heavily favoured the United States. I find it quite repulsive that the United States government is talking about friends and economies working together when in the context of the airline market it is really looking to prop up the cash flow of ailing US airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very nice caption that describes the US airline industry: `Lean, mean, and frequently bankrupt'. I think that is the best description we can give it. Through chapter 11, whereby the airlines are able to set aside the debts that they have incurred, walk away from them, and come back in again with a much lower debt burden to handle, they can get away with this sort of intrusion onto the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that Asian airlines&mdash;when I say Asian airlines, that means Qantas&mdash;and this government have to be alert to ensure that we are not subject to the piracy of the US government and the US airlines trying to prop up bad commercial decisions, bad management in the case of those US airlines, and trying to protect their interests. When we look to the negotiations that are yet to come forward in respect of Australia, Osaka and the United States we will need to ensure that Australia's interests are fully protected because, as we look to an increasing and improving international airline climate, the return from the public float of Qantas will be greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this legislation is based on two things: one is to float off the rest of Qantas in a much more favourable airlines climate and the other is to protect the rights of Qantas employees because the sale has not proceeded according to the original timetable. I fully support the legislation. The objective here is to protect the interests of Australia, Australian taxpayers and Australian citizens and to get the maximum return for the airline. It is not good enough to say, `You should have done this years ago'. I said in my opening remarks that the opposition was crying crocodile tears this morning. I want to see Australia's interests protected, that we maximise the return and, most importantly, that British Airways does not become the tail wagging the dog in respect of Australia's national flag carrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention one last matter and that is my disappointment in seeing Qantas involved in the row over the Burmese, or Myanmar, seafarers from the vessel <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Angelic Faith</EMPHASIS>, which was tied up in Dalrymple Bay in Queensland last month. Those seafarers had been underpaid some $200,000. Negotiations resulted in those seafarers being paid their money. But on their way to Bangkok the seafarers were taken off a flight, obviously with the agreement of Qantas, and sent back to Rangoon rather than to Bangkok. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who were involved in the ship safety inquiry and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report know only too well that Burmese seafarers are exploited, impoverished, intimidated and forced into signing contracts that no-one for a moment would possibly contemplate in this country. They were taken off a Qantas flight at Singapore on its way to Bangkok where they were to start a new life. The company involved in that was the Star Corporation Shipping Company, and that company ought to be standing up very clearly and accepting responsibility for the infamy that has occurred in respect of those seafarers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention that in passing. It is not a matter germane to the nature of the bill, but I take the opportunity to mention that and to concern the company involved&mdash;the Star Corporation Shipping Company&mdash;which I understand is a Greek shipping company. That is the sort of intimidation and exploitation that is taking place in respect of seafarers on some ships operating into this country. I support the bill and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been a very useful debate on the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill. I have listened with great interest to the comments by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), both of whom know a considerable amount about transport. What they have both had to say in this debate I think adds to the knowledge of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was, therefore, rather concerned and surprised that the honourable member for Shortland should take such great exception to my suggestion that, had this debate taken place five years ago, leading to the privatisation of Qantas some five years earlier than is expected, many of the problems facing that company and the government in terms of its  privatisation schedule, the funding and the support to the budget which it is meant to achieve would obviously have been significantly less. The honourable member for Shortland seems to forget that he has been a member of a government that has been in power now for nearly 11 years. The government has had plenty of time to develop a worthwhile and constructive privatisation program which should have included Qantas, which should have been sold at a time when the international civil aviation environment was significantly better than it is today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Shortland is perfectly correct to make the point that internationally, and by extension nationally, civil aviation is going through a period of intense competition and a fierce price-cutting war around the globe. We do not know at this stage what the outcome of that will be but, as he rightly says, one thing is clear: most international carriers are running at a loss. Most American international carriers are broke but, because of the strange nature of their bankruptcy law, they are able to set aside their debts and continue to compete on international markets despite their lack of fundamental financial viability. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consider this in the context of Qantas and its privatisation some very important questions need to be asked and answered. What are Qantas's prospects of making a profit? I am reliably informed that this calendar year it is anticipated there will be a small profit. It is also anticipated that the Australian Airlines component will do better next year than it has done this year or last year. That is well and good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when we see Qantas in the context of its international profile, the situation is both complicated and difficult. Internationally, there is massive overcapacity of all airlines right around the globe. All European carriers, except British Airways, are losing enormous sums of money. All US carriers are also in a loss situation. In Asia, in the Asia-Pacific region in particular, even Japan Airlines is losing money, and it has the added problem of having high yen based costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines are at this stage still operating at a profit. Thai Airways International is breaking even. We do not know the circumstances facing Garuda Indonesia Airlines. We know that Philippine Airlines is losing money. We do not know the circumstances relating to China Airways. Malaysian Airlines is still profitable, although it has purchased a significant number of new aircraft which must be paid for and will add to the problem of overcapacity. Finally, Air New Zealand, in which Qantas has a significant shareholding, is also profitable, as was mentioned by both the previous speakers, the honourable members for Fadden and Shortland. In fact, last year it made a profit in excess of $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the whole question of the privatisation of Qantas must be seen in the context of an aggressive timetable. The timetable must involve the linkage of Qantas and Australian Airlines, which, as I said, is proceeding despite all the difficulties associated with such a linkage between an international carrier on the one hand and a domestic carrier on the other, including the need to relate the fleets of the two airlines, some of the aircraft of which are not necessarily compatible. Of course, the Australian Airlines component will see the sale of a number of its aircraft over the next year or so, again depending on the capacity of the international market to absorb those aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the forward sale? What exactly does it mean now in the context of this legislation where we see the government yet again having to go back on its earlier decisions and reschedule the sale of the remaining 75 per cent of Qantas? Politically, of course, one obviously takes the opportunity in a circumstance such as this to say that this is yet another backflip on the privatisation of the airline, a privatisation which was originally guaranteed by the government in 1990. Here we are in 1993 and we are changing the arrangements yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that last May the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) told parliament that the sale would go ahead in October-November this year or in April-May next year. But now we are being told, in the context of this legislation, that the Qantas sale will be deferred until 1994-95. This latest delay does follow, despite everything that the honourable member for Shortland has said, a long list of postponements, muddles, date changes and rule changes which have plagued the sale ever since it was originally conceived back in September 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, I stand by every word I have uttered. This whole program should have been brought to the parliament five years ago when the economic environment, both domestically and internationally, was substantially more beneficial for the sale of an Australian asset, estimated now at some $2 billion, the sale of which under those circumstances would undoubtedly have been much easier than is presently the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole question of the sale of Qantas in 1994-95 is totally underpinned by a hope. In all frankness, at this stage that it is all it is, a hope. The government is pinning its hopes on an upturn in international aviation markets by that time. But, if it is wrong, what will happen? Will we come back here yet again for another change of legislation, another set of amendments, or will the government put Qantas on the block and sell it at bargain basement prices? I sincerely hope that no-one in this House would suggest that that would be an adequate answer. But much must be done in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point was made by both previous speakers, the honourable member for Shortland and honourable member for Fadden, that Qantas for a long time has been severely undercapitalised. In fact, even now, despite recent changes, the deficit-equity ratio is still at some 70:30. I must admit that is an improvement on the 80:20 ratio of debt which we had only 12 months ago, but I think that it does demonstrate the tightness of the financial environment in which Qantas is trying to operate. What are the timings looking to the future? As I said, clearly November 1994 is possible, April 1995 is likely, but obviously anything before that under current circumstances appears to be unviable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas bought Australian Airlines and paid $400 million to the Commonwealth. British Airways bought a 25 per cent interest in Qantas and paid $625 million to the Commonwealth. The outcome of this was that the Commonwealth took a $1.3 billion debt off Qantas, which is equivalent to putting cash in. Honourable members should not forget what I said: we are dealing with an organisation which has been severely undercapitalised for far too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the debt Qantas still has is government guaranteed. That is an important factor in the context of privatisation. Qantas initiated a $1.3 billion government assured debt which is mainly short-term commercial. It involves 90-day rollovers, but it has a credit rating based on this government guarantee. But that debt must be repaid before the Qantas float; in other words, before the end of 1994-95. That again will depend on the capacity of Qantas to be able to compete in the current economic environment and in a very tight internationally competitive situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas has a new credit policy. It has $550 million in US denominations, which have been issued. It has 850 million MTNs, also in US denominations, again to be issued up to $200 million. It is expected that this will be largely commercial paper with a bank facility behind it. All of that must be in place, and I understand it will be, by the end of October 1993, although the original timetable was somewhat earlier. There is also a further bond issue of $300 million which has been completed. So the refinancing of Qantas in a relatively short period will be critically important to the methodology of the privatisation program and the impact that will have on the debt ratios and the price which the market will perceive as being appropriate for Qantas shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MTNs which I referred to are over a fairly long period, some 12 to 13 years, but commercial paper, which has some 90 days effectively, with a three-year bank facility can be interpreted as long-term debt. I mentioned earlier the sale of aircraft from the Australian Airlines fleet. There are four Airbuses to be sold late in 1994. Again we do not know what the international market will be for second-hand aircraft at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point was also made by my colleague the honourable member for Fadden about engineering skills. It is quite true that Qantas has built up considerable engineering skills in recent years, despite the fact that this government only a few years ago allowed Qantas to effectively export its engineering requirements and, to a large degree, close down its skills base in this country, again because it argued&mdash;with some justification&mdash;that the costs of employing staff in Australia to do that work were not competitive with overseas cost structures. Nevertheless, it is now doing maintenance work for Chinese, Malaysian and South Pacific airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must not be forgotten that Air New Zealand, in which Qantas has a share, also has engineering capacity. Our current labour rates and our award arrangements, even in the context of Air New Zealand, make Qantas uncompetitive internationally. Therefore, in the context of international competitiveness the question of Australia's labour rates and our industrial relations policy overall is of fundamental importance to determine whether by 1995 Qantas will be on a sound base to not only privatise itself but on a basis which will make it worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to see a creditable financial improvement during 1993-94, and it is generally believed in the money markets that that level of profit must be in the range of at least $150 million. Hopefully, the outcome will be better by 1994-95 when it will need to be in the range of $400 million to make it a creditable proposition in the context of its assets base and the total Qantas package which it offers the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, it is worth noting that Qantas has some $300 million-plus in tax credits which must also be used up before Qantas shareholders can be offered franked dividends. The biggest difficulty is the market where the mums and dads of Australia are actually interested in the prospects of buying shares in Woolworths and other companies, including the Commonwealth Bank which has been on the market with another share tranche coming up very soon. The question arises as to what extent Qantas will be seen as a good growth stock. I emphasise the word `growth'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all the will in the world, in the foreseeable future Qantas is not likely to be marketed as a major dividend earner in the short to medium term. People will be buying it because it is Australia's flag carrier; people will be buying it because they want to have a piece of international civil aviation action; people will be buying it because they think to some degree it is the right thing to do as an Australian. But I think it is important to remember that while it will have potential for growth, all else being equal, it is not likely to be a major dividend earner in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few comments in relation to this legislation which I want to make. The bill before the House today is essential for the sale of Qantas because it amends the Qantas Sale Act to take account of the deferral of the Qantas sale, the details of which I have already noted. As I said, it is really five years too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that when the Minister for Finance told parliament the sale would proceed it took him seven weeks to issue a press release saying that it would be deferred until 1994-95. Subsequently, there have been media reports and recriminations by the asset sales task force, which has claimed that Qantas misled it over the airline's budget projections. Qantas has defended its profit projections, claiming that it has always said they were volatile. From my discussions with Qantas and from the evidence contained in my presentation to the House today, I think its case is self-evident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1993 postpones the date on which provisions of the sale act of 1992 are automatically repealed from December this year to 30 June 1995. Do not forget that we are talking about a lot of money. We are talking about the sale of a major Australian asset at an anticipated value of some $2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the assumption that the Qantas float would take place in 1993, the original act provided for unproclaimed sections to be automatically repealed if not enacted by 31 December of this year. Consequently, the government's deferral of the Qantas float until 1994-95 means that any provisions of the original act not commenced by the end of 1993 will be repealed automatically and not extended by this amendment bill. Without the bill, the deferral of the Qantas public share offering would mean the automatic repeal on 31 December this year of the 50 per cent and the 100 per cent sale day provisions in the principal act. The government claims that these provisions relate to Qantas employees&mdash;in fact, this was the point made in the second reading speech&mdash;and said how retaining accrued benefits and being removed from the ambit of legislation governing Commonwealth employees post-sale was significant in the terms of this amending legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises the question which was raised by my colleague the honourable member for Fadden&mdash;namely, that of the maximum staff share ownership. I totally endorse what my colleague said. International evidence, and domestic evidence in other cases, shows quite clearly that where the shareholding can be maximised in the hands of those who work for a corporation, automatically they have a commitment to its success which usually results in a better bottom line than is achieved in a situation where there are simply paid employees with no emotional connection with their employer. Therefore, in the final formula of the sale contract the opposition would like to see the employees of Qantas and Australian Airlines&mdash;which then of course will be one corporation&mdash;given every opportunity to maximise their ownership in this extremely important Australian asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech, the Minister for Finance claimed that the government's major concern in introducing this amendment was the preservation of Qantas employee entitlements. But this is only part of the story. In fact, without the amendment bill many other provisions relating to the progressive transfer of Qantas from the government to the private sector would also lapse and therefore, for technical reasons, there was no choice but to go ahead with this amending legislation. However, as I said initially, it is yet another instance in the long list of postponements, muddles, date changes and rule changes which have plagued the Qantas sale since it was finally decided on way back in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the government's overall asset sales, I seek the permission of the House to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a media release which shows that over the last five years Labor's asset sales program has failed to live up to its expectations.

But the shortfall in achieving its objectives over the period 1988 right through to 1992-93 gives the House very little room for optimism that they will be achieved in this financial year, and leaves considerable room for scepticism that the government really knows what it is trying to do in terms of its privatisation program.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is a healthy sign that the government is now inserting sunset clauses in legislation. In Australia, as in many other parts of the world, we tend to drown in a sea of legislation. Quite often a lot of this legislation has existed on the statute books for a very long period of time and, for all intents and purposes, is a dead letter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in this case, when the government originally brought in the Qantas Sales Act 1992 it did seek to bring a discipline upon itself to force it to complete the intentions of the legislation within certain finite time periods. Perhaps it was also intended to be used as a whip against the Labor Party factions to make sure that they did not intrude to frustrate the laudable, though belated, aims of the bill which sought to return Qantas to private ownership. The principal amendment is to subsection 2(6) of the act which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a provision of this Act has not commenced before 31 December 1993, the provision is taken to have been repealed on that day.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the discipline which the government now seeks to ask the parliament to extend. For various reasons, some of which have been outlined by previous speakers, parts of the principal act have not come into effect and unless this bill is carried here, and indeed in another place, the privatisation will not proceed completely. The government has therefore sought to ask our assistance to bail it out of a hole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the House, we know government is a necessary evil. We ought always to ensure that government is kept to the absolute minimum degree possible. Our philosophy in the Liberal and National parties is to support free enterprise and, as a general rule, we consider that government ought not to be running enterprises in competition with the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has only to look at the very long list of financial disasters which have resulted from various government activities&mdash;particularly state Labor government activities&mdash;and from their very many largely failed attempts to be entrepreneurial in the marketplace. I think it is a truism that governments cannot be as efficient as the private sector and thus we support the privatisation of Qantas, which really ought to be seen as returning to the Australian people the right to own some shares in a very important national enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, the government, with its slavish adherence to its former socialist philosophy, used to consider that privatisation was, in effect, depriving the Australian people of important assets. The reverse is of course the case. If we were gullible in looking at the legislation which was brought in in 1992, we could consider initially that the government had been converted to our philosophy. Perhaps some people might have suggested that the government had become a latter-day St Paul on the road to Damascus. But the reality is that the proposed sale of Qantas does the right thing for the wrong reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the 13 March election, we have read and heard about the absolute financial hole into which the Labor Party has put Australia over more than 10 years in office. We know how absolutely desperate it is for funds. We know what a disaster the Australian economy is. Therefore, we ought to see the Qantas sale legislation for what it really is&mdash;an attempt to obtain money, a money grab to reduce the budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, when one sells off assets that money ought to be used to reduce debt. It is totally wrong for that money to be used for the purposes of recurrent expenditure, as the government intends. I repeat: asset sales should be used to reduce debt. The government's actions now are akin to a farmer flogging off the family farm, failing to discharge his debts to the bank and then blowing the proceeds on a holiday. The net result of the government's actions is the debt remains and it has to be paid by our children and our grandchildren. That is one of the great crosses that this generation and this government will have to bear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his contribution the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) pointed out that, once the proceeds from the sale of Qantas disappear into the bottomless pit of the government's deficit, the government will look around for other public enterprises to privatise. Of course, we on this side of the House strongly support privatisation; but, once again, the government will seek to rob Peter to pay Paul. As the honourable member for Higgins said, Telecom will undoubtedly be one of the first cabs off the rank. Although the Telecom employees strongly supported the Labor government prior to the 13 March election, it will be interesting to see how they react to a proposed imminent sale by Labor of Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas is a great company. All Australians should take pride in what Qantas has achieved. However, it should also be appreciated that, because Qantas has been a government airline, it has been forced to be responsive to government policy which has prevented it from competing properly in the marketplace. For example, in the area of foreign policy, this government has used Qantas as a tool. It forced Qantas to open direct air links with Zimbabwe. While I am certainly not opposed to air links with that country, most people at the time would not have considered that as a profitable route. Qantas, therefore, was compelled to make losses as part of the government's political agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, Qantas opened services with the People's Republic of China. Again, I would support services to that place, but the result was, I understand, that initially losses were made again. It is unfair to expect Qantas to be entirely efficient when the government is telling the airline where it ought to fly for the government's own purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that Qantas was prohibited from travelling on the most profitable air route in the world&mdash;that between Australia and South Africa. Labor said that, because of Australia's opposition to certain South African policies, the government owned South African Airways was to have a monoply on this sector. Also, Qantas has been prohibited from flying to Taiwan. We ought to recognise that one of the great benefits of the sale of Qantas is that Qantas will be able to spread its wings, literally and financially, and compete fairly in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) pointed out that the government has missed the boat as far as the public float of shares in Qantas is concerned. While it is recognised that the share market is not presently ideal for share floats, five years ago the situation was different. Indeed, had the government taken this action then, we would have seen a resurgent Qantas which would have had a much greater share of the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been stated that it is important, indeed vital, for Qantas staff to be given the opportunity to acquire shares in the airline. The best form of service will emanate from people who have a vested interest in the airline's success. I certainly hope that the government will do whatever it can to encourage Qantas staff to take up shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated by earlier speakers, the opposition does not oppose this bill. But the opposition is concerned at the long list of postponements and muddles that we have seen in the selling of Qantas shares. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) is seeking in this bill to extend the time limit for outstanding matters from 31 December 1993 to 30 June 1995. I hope that some time down the track the government will not march back into this place to ask us to indulge in further extensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the sale proceed within the extended time limit. It is important that Qantas be given the opportunity to compete properly, openly and freely.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking in the debate on the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill really to go back over some of the privatisation approaches that the coalition has had for some years now. I particularly refer to a paper that I produced in April 1989 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Privatisation&mdash;the Australian way</EMPHASIS>. Those in the coalition will recall that paper. The policy has not changed much. The only thing that seems to have changed over time is that others have taken my name off the paper and put theirs on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important things to draw to mind in this paper are the reasons for privatisation: the lack of managerial autonomy; inflexibility in the capacity to raise capital; the requirement to perceive political priorities; the rigid and entrenched labour practices; the lack of exposure to competition of deregulated markets, which fosters commercial complacency and hence inefficiency. Those are the basic tenets under which privatisation was approached by the coalition back in the 1980s. Nothing has considerably changed from that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill today is purely a deferring matter&mdash;a matter which reflects on the management of the privatisation progress and process more than it does on Qantas. I have to draw the attention of the House to the areas, the nominated companies, in this booklet at which the coalition was aiming back in those days: Aussat, Australian Airlines, the Australian Industry Development Corporation, Australian National Line, the Commonwealth Bank, domestic and international air terminals, Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, Medibank Private, OTC, Pipeline Authority, Qantas and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. When that list was released Mr Hawke&mdash;well remembered as a former Prime Minister; these days one wishes he was back&mdash;was horrified at the prospect of having these sales take place: `The great sell-off: the opposition sells the world', Labor cried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, half of those companies have already been privatised and the other half have had added to them some additional government enterprises which will be sold in the near future. As a consequence of this, we are able to encourage various state governments to approach their state instrumentalities with a view to privatisation, because by far the biggest area for privatisation of government assets is in the state government sphere. Certainly, looking at the operations of some of the marketing boards, some of the large assets that are held in electricity, water, ports and railroads, a vast quantity of assets exist all requiring updating and all requiring government dollars. At the present moment, the public would far rather see those authorities in private hands where the dollars are more readily raised than through the taxation system of governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those matters are all raised in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Privatisation&mdash;the Australian way</EMPHASIS>. As one goes through the booklet, one will see two other things which are most important. One is that all moneys raised by privatisation in our plan were devoted to debt retirement. The government's process to date has been singularly marked by the application of what funds it has raised&mdash;something short of $3 billion&mdash;to current expenditures. If this is to continue, then quite clearly the debt of the nation will never be addressed, because the only way it will be faced in the future will be through higher taxation. At the present moment, that is politically untenable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second important thing about this booklet is that it sets out the ways in which sales should take place. From what I have seen to date, in particular regarding the Qantas debacle, when the first approaches were made to the market, with the help of an underwriting adviser, expressions of interest were called both for Australian Airlines and for Qantas&mdash;the ones that were not for sale at any price. Eventually, when both airline corporations decided that they wanted to take over each other, the government intervened to ensure that Qantas took over Australian Airlines for some $400 million. We are still waiting to see the outcome of that because management structures are being adjusted. There has been substantial labour loss. We are yet to see the full working efficiencies of that merger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, Qantas has been subject to a number of changes&mdash;firstly, the trade sell-off of 25 per cent to British Airways. When Qantas was put up for a trade tender of 25 per cent, the successful bidder was British Airways. The price set and paid by that corporation&mdash;some $600-odd million&mdash;was certainly very high. Whether the government can possibly achieve a comparable price for the two united airlines of Australian and Qantas has yet to be seen. To take it to the market in an inappropriate and unprepared state would almost certainly end in disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reflect also on two other areas. With regard to the Commonwealth Bank, the first tranche was offered on a fixed price, first in, best dressed basis. I notice that the offering currently in the marketplace is based on a floating price, following the success of the Woolworths float. I hope that the underwriters and the government can get a sufficient distribution of shares, not only to the current shareholders but also to wider areas of Australia. A most important part of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Privatisation&mdash;the Australian way</EMPHASIS> was ensuring that the maximum number of Australians could get into shares. By doing that, we encourage savings, participation and interest in what is going on in the commercial areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I especially want to emphasise the tremendous need for employee shares. If we can encourage all employees to hold shares, even on most generous terms, then the benefit to that corporation, and ultimately to the total economy, is almost assured. I hope that any future privatisations will ensure those things; it was certainly carried out in the Commonwealth Bank float. I hope that, when we come to Qantas and the other floats that will inevitably come down the track, that aspect is very securely written into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to continue for long in the debate, but I wish to draw people's attention to the history of privatisation and the paper the coalition produced. What we advocated is now being followed by the government. There are aspects of that program which I still commend to everybody. I hope that, when they see the benefits of privatisation in another five years time, they might reflect that it was a pity that the government did not do it earlier. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation was formed in 1970 to consolidate the engineering expertise accumulated</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>during the construction of the Snowy Mountains scheme. I am sure all Australians agree that that was a period of enormous significance for the engineering skills of this nation. SMEC, as the corporation is called, is based in Cooma and specialises in engineering services, road construction and overseas aid projects. By and large, it has created a very good standard of performance internationally and has a very worthwhile reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990-91, SMEC made a small profit of $309,000 on assets of over $9 million during a period when, for international economic reasons of which we are all aware, there was not only considerable international competition for projects, but a dearth of projects available on the market. In 1991-92, SMEC made a consolidated after-tax profit of $314,000; and it is expected to announce a $1 million profit for the year to June 1993. In other words, it has hopefully gone through its low period and is rising out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company has been consistently rated in the top 200 international design firms and has successfully completed over 1,500 separate projects in Australia and in some 53 countries overseas, mainly in the Third World. It has performed this work for aid agencies, government organisations and various private sector clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SMEC's expertise includes civil, electrical and mechanical engineering, aspects of water resources development, power generation and transmission, irrigation and land development, road engineering and transportation, procurement and project management. As well as its many overseas successes, SMEC has been active in pursuing privatised infrastructure projects within Australia. SMEC supervised the $100 million bypass around the city of Goulburn on the Hume Highway, which is well known to all honourable members, especially those from New South Wales who take the road to Canberra. SMEC has also been involved with the clean waterways program for the Sydney Water Board, providing staff in several disciplines, including construction, estimating, tunnelling and other infrastructure development areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition was the first to advocate the privatisation of SMEC in about 1988. The government announced SMEC's 100 per cent sale in its 1992 budget. At last, we have reached a common point. A pre-sale scoping study was undertaken for the asset sales task force of the Department of Finance by Arthur Andersen and Co., which is now acting as consultants on the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the 1993 election, the government indicated a preference for an employee buyout, subject to a fair price being negotiated, the company being viable and the sale taking place within a reasonable time scale. A staff buyout has come forward in the name of Tinbury. As I understand it, Tinbury, in terms of share ownership, is held by about 100 of the 240 staff&mdash;mainly the technical and professional staff. It is offering a staff buyout for the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Negotiations between the government and Tinbury have been protracted for some six months or so and are still unresolved. The government approved the staff buyout of SMEC in March of this year. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) wrote to Tinbury requesting that a proposal be submitted by the end of May. It is now September and, as I said, apparently no agreement has yet been reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has foreshadowed that there is a point when negotiations with Tinbury must come to an end. It may have to look at other methods of selling SMEC, including considering the possibilities of the industry being involved. From the opposition's point of view it is essential that in the final analysis the government maximises the value of SMEC in whatever sale price is finally achieved. We are moving an amendment to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulties in this sale, however, which otherwise would have been a fairly clear-cut affair, concern a claim against SMEC, known as the Dartmouth Dam claim, for work undertaken in a project. In 1990 there was an incident at the Dartmouth Dam power station which has made an accurate valuation of SMEC very difficult. On 2 May 1990, two 80-kilogram girders from a gatehouse at the top of the Dartmouth Dam collapsed and were swept into the heart of a generator, causing a massive explosion. The Dartmouth Dam power station, one of Victoria's largest hydro-electric power stations, has only recently recommenced operations. In the meantime, Victoria had to purchase additional power from New South Wales. Even though the cost of rebuilding the damaged generator and power station was kept to around $29 million&mdash;significantly below the $80-odd million originally believed to be the cost&mdash;the claim initiated as a result of this incident, and for consequential damages and lost power generation, has not been settled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State Electricity Commission of Victoria is suing the Rural Water Resources Commission of Victoria and SMEC for $89m in alleged damages. The Rural Water Resources Commission also has a cross-claim against SMEC for a further $1.65 million. SMEC has legal representation. It is contesting the claims but it is unable to estimate its liability, if any. If litigation proceeds&mdash;and that is not by any means certain; there is considerable doubt about that&mdash;SMEC's liability could be much larger than its insurance cover and the value of its assets. As I said earlier, its assets are valued at around $9 million. If SMEC has to pay substantial damages, it will, in effect, be liquidated. One of the problems hampering negotiations has been placing a value on this risk. In recognition of this contingent liability, the government is offering Tinbury&mdash;it is not contained in this bill&mdash;a limited money back guarantee. This means that if SMEC is liquidated, Tinbury's up-front payment for SMEC will be refunded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the legislation in some detail. The legislation will effectively divorce SMEC from Commonwealth legislation and jurisdiction. It is important to remember that the Commonwealth's liability under SMEC, as it currently stands, is that it is the sole shareholder of a limited liability company. In terms of the Dartmouth Dam case,  whether the Commonwealth continues to own SMEC or SMEC is sold on to another owner, the limited liability provision will still stand. That, again, is a factor which no doubt the other parties to the claim will have to take into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation contains the changes required to enable SMEC's sale, while allowing for a range of outcomes&mdash;including a trade sale&mdash;in the event that the government cannot strike an acceptable agreement with Tinbury. The Minister for Finance stated that as a condition of sale, Tinbury must maintain operations in Cooma and not on-sell SMEC for five years. The third and an important criterion for sale is that the company must remain primarily Australian and that the staff must be given every opportunity to purchase the available equity in the company. But, as I said, the months go by and no settlement has yet been effectively achieved; no contract has been signed. The Minister for Finance has previously stated that as well as maintaining operations in Cooma, any other buyer must incorporate concessional employee shareholding and preserve Australian ownership and control. The opposition supports these conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to reduce the initial cost of Tinbury purchasing SMEC, this legislation contains a provision for extinguishing SMEC's accumulated tax losses. The effect of that is that profits from the financial year in which the sale occurs onwards will be fully taxable as if no past tax losses had been made. The effect of that is that the actual purchase price of SMEC could be lower than previously anticipated, but it would not carry with it any additional benefit to the purchaser who would be required to pay full tax on profits for the period under consideration. It is not intended to proclaim this provision unless the removal of tax losses is part of a sales agreement approved by the government. One could ask the question: why put it in the bill if it is up for negotiation? It is quite unusual to put things in legislation and then state that they are subject to negotiation when, after all, an act is meant to be an absolute. In effect, this provision reduces the up-front purchase price of SMEC by an amount the government expects to recoup if and when SMEC makes future profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the contingent liability hanging over SMEC, this provision is not regarded as being unreasonable&mdash;and it is likely that even a trade buyer would want similar terms. But that touches upon the point I made: having put up the flag and offering this as the basis of negotiation, it probably would have been better to have emphasised it as an absolute rather than as something which is open to negotiation. Furthermore, in the event that SMEC prospers, the effect of the provision&mdash;theoretically, at least&mdash;will be revenue neutral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it quite clear to the House that the opposition wholeheartedly supports the privatisation of SMEC. In the totality of the privatisation program of the government, SMEC is a relatively small and incidental item. In the context of the town of Cooma, however, SMEC is of some relevance. It has a staff of some 240 people. There are  hundreds of people living in the town who are dependent upon SMEC. It has a very long history with Cooma, the southern highlands, the Snowy Mountains scheme and so forth. Naturally, people would like to see that continue. That is why the opposition has supported the view that any future buyer, including Tinbury, should be required as part of the purchase agreement to guarantee that it would remain in Cooma and not on-sell for at least five years. That, as we see it, is a fair deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is particularly concerned that in any case where the government is negotiating with only one bidder, as it is in the case of Tinbury, any contract resulting from such negotiations must not be seen to undervalue SMEC or to be susceptible to the charge that it undervalues the company or its assets. We believe that it would be both prudent and appropriate for the government to seek the opposition's concurrence with any contract that the government may negotiate as a result of a non-competitive sale process. The opposition is thus moving an amendment to the effect that any sale must maximise the value of SMEC. Ideally, any contract negotiated for the sale of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation as a result of a non-competitive process should receive the approval of the opposition before being signed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that one of my colleagues will be moving a further amendment to express the hope that SMEC will continue to be involved in major developmental projects, such as the turning inland of rivers in North Queensland and elsewhere. It must be understood that once SMEC is privatised the projects with which it becomes involved will be the absolute responsibility of its board and not of government, because the government will no longer have a shareholding of any nature in the company. Nevertheless, my colleague's view would be shared by any honourable member wishing Australian engineering corporations, such as SMEC and its various competitors across the land, to be seen as being of world standard, as we know they are, and therefore well and truly capable of being involved in Australia's major national development projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of the sale of SMEC, as I said, is not something of enormous financial benefit to the Commonwealth&mdash;it might be worth $1 million; it might be worth a little more. Nevertheless, I have gone to some lengths in my address to point out the difficulty of trying to assess the actual value of the company in the context of the Dartmouth claim. That claim, in the event that it proceeds, would be a claim against a limited liability company and limited to the level of that liability. In one way or the other, any claim in excess of the insurance cover, the actual assets backing of the company and the debts carried by the shareholders in the company, under many circumstances, would result in liquidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of its association with the Snowy Mountains scheme, it would be a pity if SMEC fell upon evil days, but those are the realities of the commercial market. Tinbury, and the personnel involved in it, are well aware of the implications of that situation. It is in that context that the sale of SMEC is probably quite different from the sale of any other government assets. Many of them, such as Qantas&mdash;the sale of which we debated in this House only a few minutes ago&mdash;have their difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing about the Tinbury bid is that it emphasises one of the principles which the opposition believes is important in privatisation projects: that is, wherever possible, employed staff should be given the maximum opportunity to become shareholders in the enterprise of which they form such a vital part. In industries such as engineering and in a company such as SMEC, it goes without saying that the major asset of the corporation is the intellectual property of its personnel. Apart from its old buildings, which were built in Cooma in the 1950s, it has very little else except the intellectual capacity of its employees and the goodwill they have created over the decades through the quality of the projects with which they have been associated both in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this does complicate to some extent how one values a corporation of this type. How does one put a monetary figure on intellectual property, which depends not just on the past but also on the future viability of the corporation, and which in turn depends on the flow of projects to it from both government and the private sector in Australia and overseas?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one visits the headquarters of SMEC in Cooma, one cannot but be impressed by the photographs on the wall in the foyer which set out in some detail the substantial projects it has carried through in recent years&mdash;in Malaysia, Thailand and elsewhere. I do not have the slightest doubt that Australia, being on the edge of the Asia-Pacific region, will in the years ahead have an outstanding opportunity to increase the entry of our experts into world markets, especially into regional markets, and even more especially into the markets of our neighbour countries which have seen such substantial, if not phenomenal, economic growth over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In China the growth rate has been 10 per cent. In most of the ASEAN countries it has been six per cent or more. That puts Australia's two per cent or less into stark relief. Those countries will be looking for investment, for know-how and for expertise. In fields such as engineering, in the areas where SMEC has established a very worthy reputation over recent years, I have no doubt that its personnel will be able to play a very significant role in getting out into world markets, tendering for projects and winning its fair share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point in the amendment which I have advised the House that I intend to move that it is very important that the asset values, once determined, be progressed as best we can. SMEC is a Commonwealth asset; it belongs to the Australian people. In a sense, there are two balancing acts here. On both sides of the House there is agreement that the first priority for sale should be the provision of a staff buy-out. I have also made the point that some six months have passed and, to the best of my knowledge, no deals have been achieved. One therefore has to question whether, in the desire to achieve a staff buy-out, we are giving adequate consideration to ensuring that the Australian taxpayers' interest in SMEC is also being adequately protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately that is an executive decision to be made by the government. But it is the role of the opposition to put on record the fact that we are watching and are concerned. It is our responsibility to ensure that the final contract is in the interest of the Australian people and maximises the value of the asset. SMEC will be sold. We must ensure that in the method of its sale we are adding to Australia's intellectual capacity in the engineering field and that what has been built up over some years is not lost. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to support the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Limited Sale Bill in this, my maiden post-ministerial speech. I am also particularly pleased to speak today because this task would have been undertaken by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), who is, unfortunately, overseas. I would like to record at the outset that he particularly wanted to be here when this bill was debated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said when he was introducing this bill, the sale of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Ltd represents another important step in the government's micro-economic reform program. It is also a vital and logical step in the development of a company that under government ownership has established itself as Australia's foremost international engineering consultancy firm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have misgivings about some privatisations, particularly those engaged in at times by state governments, because there is a downside to privatisation. I do not regard privatisation as an ideological must. However, in this case we have an organisation that has established itself, and what the government is doing is very sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SMEC has completed more than 1,700 major projects in 55 countries and more than 80 per cent of its current revenue is derived from international business. In this most competitive industry, SMEC has demonstrated that it can successfully tender for the most complex technological projects against the world's leading consultancy firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, one of its recent successes was the contract to supervise the construction of a 339-kilometre motorway linking Islamabad and Lahore in Pakistan, which was won against aggressive international competition. In addition to its traditional areas of expertise&mdash;the design and construction of major hydro-electric projects, highways and transportation, and water resources&mdash;SMEC has developed technological expertise in many disciplines which places it at the very forefront of the industry internationally. Its water resources branch, for example, which undertakes work in the fields of hydrology, hydraulics and systems simulation studies, is recognised as one of the most technologically advanced consultants in its field in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SMEC is now positioned to maintain and increase its already substantial business in the vital South-East Asia-Pacific region, adding to its national importance as a significant earner of foreign currency, and a vital flag carrier for Australian industry. Last year, when I was privileged to be Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, SMEC was on several of the delegations that I led to South-East Asia. One delegation was to Vietnam, a country that has been fighting for some 50 years. Vietnam's infrastructure was wound right down. When international aid flows to that country, it is very important that attention be given to projects such as ports, roads, dams and electricity transmission. It is very important that international engineering assistance be given. I see SMEC well placed in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) has already mentioned that the company has proved itself in the highly competitive Australian market. After winning the contract to supervise the construction of the federally funded multimillion dollar bypass around the city of Goulburn on the Hume Highway&mdash;which it completed months ahead of schedule and well within budget&mdash;it also successfully bid for the Jugiong bypass further south on the Hume Highway, which is now under construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess it is still a matter of surprise to some people that such an important international company is located in Cooma, a small Monaro town in the foothills of the Snowy Mountains. As honourable members in this House know, historically this is the legacy of its parent, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. One of the principal reasons why Cooma was selected for the headquarters of the Snowy scheme in the 1940s was that it was the closest railhead. At that time Australia had to import much of its engineering expertise, while Australians were sent abroad for training in the investigation and design of hydraulic works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Snowy scheme was nearing completion, the decision was taken in 1970 to establish an international consulting firm that would take advantage of the extraordinary talent that had been assembled, and keep these skills in Australia. Today, the wheel has come full circle and Australian expertise has developed to the point where we now export our technical excellence. SMEC has played a key role over the years in achieving this enviable situation, and engineers in many disciplines&mdash;and from many countries&mdash;now come to Australia, and frequently to Cooma, for their own training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SMEC is a major employer in Cooma, and the government's announcement that the company would be sold to staff through its buyout vehicle, Tinbury Ltd, was widely applauded. The staff buyout offers stability and sustainability. A condition of the sale is that SMEC must remain in Cooma for at least five years, and it may not be sold during this period. The board of Tinbury has made it clear that it intends to stay in Cooma for far longer than five years. It is my understanding that Tinbury will meet the criteria set out by the minister in his speech, and that the negotiations were finalised and signed on 17 September. This is the matter that was raised by the honourable member for Bradfield. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the local community, and particularly the business community of Cooma, this is good news, and the honourable member for Eden Monaro has worked tirelessly to secure this outcome for the staff and the region. I would like to pay due credit to him. Already more than half the staff are shareholders in the company, and the staff shareholding will be extended through a second prospectus to be issued prior to the settlement of the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SMEC's principal resource and asset is its skilled staff. I was privileged to launch Brad Collins's book on the Snowy. For the first 33 years of my life I lived on a farm near the Hume Highway. Through the 1950s I saw the very large trucks grinding along the highway, carrying generators and various pieces of equipment down to the Snowy scheme. It was also a source of wonder to me, seeing all this moving past to some area that I did not even see until the late 1950s. What was really wonderful about the launching of the book was that, after having read it and seen some pictures of some of the people in the book, they were there at the launching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people came from all over the world at that stage&mdash;many from war torn Europe&mdash;and by and large they settled down with what became a wonderful scheme. This bill is recognition of the fact that these people made the company what it is today, and that they are best placed to steer it to still greater success in the future. This in itself is the reason the government allowed the staff to have first option. We recognised the people, their skills and their intellectual property. We can now look forward to seeing SMEC beginning the next chapter in its long and very proud history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Limited Sale Bill simply provides the broad legislative framework within which the sale of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation may proceed. The House should not assume that the current bill in any way, shape or form provides any details as to the terms under which the final sale of the corporation might take place. To that extent, it provides no detail as to the eventual transparency of that pending transaction. On this basis, the coalition reluctantly supports the passage of the bill as it is. It gives no guarantees as to its position on the circumstances which will eventually surround the sale of the corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation&mdash;SMEC&mdash;was formed back in 1970. It was converted to a public company in 1989. The corporation was a spin-off of the engineering and construction consultancy expertise developed over the building project life of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electricity Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the late 1980s the government allowed SMEC to restructure itself in the form of a public corporation in which the Commonwealth became simply the predominant shareholder; that is to say, the government's interference in the day-to-day commercial activities of the former authority was withdrawn, and the corporation was allowed to proceed, to all intents and purposes, as any other private business. The pressure on SMEC to perform on its own was blindingly apparent, and attested to the weaknesses some governmental authorities have in meeting market conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SMEC's history over the 1980s has not been one of the high points in the history of governmental business enterprises. I know that the staff and the board of directors have struggled mightily to keep the corporation afloat over the last seven or eight years, but we are still looking at a business concern which, by any reckoning, is still proppy on its feet. SMEC's revenue dropped dramatically after 1985, and the government, for all its touted opposition to privatisation, realised that the authority had no future under the public umbrella. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence of SMEC's declining business performance was pretty stunning, to say the least. SMEC's 1985-86 annual report shows a 42 per cent decrease in revenue&mdash;effectively a loss of $3.7 million. As a result of this near crisis, a three-year corporate plan was implemented, staff cuts occurred and an external board of directors was instituted. In the first year of the plan, revenue dropped a further 25 per cent from the previous year; from $64 million down to $37 million. The loss for the year was $2.4 million. At this time, to maintain working capital, the government injected $6 million into SMEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the third year of the plan, revenue was still dropping faster than expenditure. It was patently obvious that something needed to be done. As the SMEC reports indicate, the corporation had been hit on many fronts. SMEC had proved to be `ill-suited to meet market fluctuations' and there were `too many [government] constraints' on its activities in the early to mid-1980s. Furthermore, because the majority of SMEC's work was on overseas infrastructure projects, it suffered greatly when there was a worldwide pattern of reduced emphasis on infrastructure development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SMEC also had to compete against private Australian based and foreign engineering firms which, in the early 1980s, it was ill-prepared to face. Since the authority has been corporatised, the ship has been steadied somewhat. Profit has remained relatively steady, with the corporation registering a bottom line operating profit of $274,000 in 1989. In 1990, SMEC returned an operating profit of $309,000. In 1991, SMEC's operating profit was $238,000 and in 1992 SMEC achieved an after tax profit of $290,000. That is not a great performance by any standard and one described by the chairman of SMEC as a not yet satisfactory result&mdash;something of an understatement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) informs us that SMEC is now set to make a $1 million profit next year. This looks to be true on the basis of SMEC's revenue flows as indicated in its annual reports. Revenue has climbed during the years 1990 to 1992, growing by 13 per cent, 28 per cent and 17.8 per cent for 1990, 1991 and 1992 respectively. SMEC's domestic workload has strengthened. Despite the weaknesses in the international market, overseas consultancy operations are accounting for more and more of the corporation's revenue&mdash;81 per cent of revenue in 1992, which is a good early sign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation is involved in over 100 projects in six regions: the Pacific and Papua New Guinea; Indonesia and South-East Asia; China and Hong Kong; Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Sri Lanka; the Indian subcontinent and Middle East; and Africa. It has project contracts which include a $27 million contract to supervise the building of a $US1.5 billion motorway linking Islamabad and Lahore in Pakistan; a flood damage restoration project in Bangladesh; a hydro-electric project in Guangzhou in China; and roads projects in Indonesia, Malaysia, Tonga and Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as having engineering projects, SMEC is contracted to AIDAB as a procurement contractor to supply commodities to recipient governments, ranging from textbooks and tractors, to medicines, railway signals and equipment for clearing oil spills. Despite the evidence that SMEC&mdash;its staff and board of directors&mdash;has managed to pull itself back from the brink for the time being, the terms of the privatisation of the corporation are less than clear and rightly should be scrutinised by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public, over time, has contributed strongly to the operations of SMEC and its earlier business structures. Notwithstanding the contribution the body has made to the nation's engineering and construction expertise, its terms of sale must be above board.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even opponents can have wise words. The former leader of the federal Liberal Party and the current leader of the National Farmers Federation have both said that the opposition's tactics are unprincipled and will make the country ungovernable, that they are not one-offs and that they will make a difference to the conventions in this country and the way budgets are put together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen overnight that the coalition is now sitting down with the Greens and talking about blocking the wholesale sales tax changes. There it is. Where does this crowd ever get off? A conservative party is now lining up to sit down with the Greens, of all people, to work out how to further block the government's budget because it cannot secure the support of the Democrats in blocking the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of all this is that the Leader of the Opposition will cost ordinary people $8 to $10 a week as from the middle of November. The $3 billion a year tax cuts which will flow from the middle of November upon the passage of the budget will give wage and salary earners, who have not had a wage increase now for up to two years&mdash;ordinary Australians&mdash;$8 to $10 a week and will kick along the economy. It will help retailing and manufacturing, and their inventories through the Christmas period. That $8 to $10 a week is being put at risk by the tactics of the Leader of the Opposition and his Liberal and National Party colleagues in the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will withdraw; I have withdrawn. The point for the opposition here is a very clear one: before the Senate, following passage through this House last night&mdash;and indeed it was previously before the Senate in a different form&mdash;is a proposition which will extend to Australian taxpayers a benefit which they should receive before Christmas. Included amongst the propositions is one which would extend taxation relief to those people earning below $20,000 a year. It will provide that benefit not on the basis of just seven months worth of a tax benefit; it will provide it on the basis of a full 12 months benefit in the form of a rebate which will be collectable by them at the end of the financial year. The opposition needs to pass these measures so that these benefits can be provided to the people of Australia and to people on those particular incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition probably does not understand that many of the people earning below $20,000 a year do not work for the whole year; and that cannot always be reflected by their PAYE benefits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Do the ABS employment statistics for the retail sector display a regular seasonal pattern? Are there reasons for expecting that pattern to be different in 1993-94?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1326" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that the ABS figures on retail sales show that December is the peak month of the year for the retail sector. Turnover in December for the retail sector as a whole is typically well over one-third higher than for the average of the other 11 months of the year. Retail traders take on additional staff to handle that seasonal spike of customers in their shops. This creates many jobs, particularly for young people, for school leavers and for people who are on university vacation. It also provides many other temporary jobs for people who might otherwise have been out of work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS publications on labour force figures show that last December the retail sector appears to have created some 35,000 to 40,000 seasonal jobs; that is, jobs additional to the underlying pattern of employment. This December we should see an even bigger seasonal boost because the government has, through its fiscal policy, designed a stimulus to provide additional support to the economy at that time, whilst at the same time laying down a firm foundation for the reduction in the budget deficit over the years ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key ingredient to this additional stimulus is the personal income tax cuts which the government would like to give as from 15 November, providing an additional opportunity for people to spend more in the lead-up to, and at the time of, Christmas. But it would be fiscally irresponsible for the government to proceed with those cuts without having the rest of the package; in other words, providing the tax cuts while the opposition has the rest of the strategy held hostage in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By stubbornly opposing these tax cuts and stubbornly opposing this package, the opposition is essentially threatening 40,000 jobs for Australians over Christmas as would be provided by this boost to the retail industry. Instead of there being more jobs this Christmas, instead of more people being taken on by the retail sector, we could, as a result of the Liberal Party's tactics, see fewer people taken on, therefore removing the opportunity for 40,000 seasonal jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do Liberal Party members want to deny tax cuts to ordinary working men and women in Australia, but also they want to deny part-time employment to their sons and daughters who otherwise might be able to go out and get a job during that particular period. We only have to remember that at this time last year, the Leader of the Opposition was still clinging to a policy which would have taxed Christmas to the hilt, would have taxed everything that went on the Christmas table, and would have taxed every present that was ever bought for any child throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he wants to do on this occasion is not so much tax Christmas, but postpone it until next July. Last year the Leader of the Opposition saw the light and abandoned his policy. I suggest he does the same this year.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said during the election campaign that the government would not leave the unemployed to fall behind and become an underclass, that we would keep the unemployed as part of the mainstream labour market and that the government's policies would focus on growth in employment&mdash;an inclusive policy to include all Australians in that activity. On the basis of our performance in the 1980s in terms of employment growth and our devotion of economic policy to growth, the government will, of course, as it is now, with low inflation and low interest rates, and a budget to bring the deficit down, set up a situation where growth in the economy can proceed. The profit share is already rising to its late 1980s high level, which is reflected by a very high level of the all ordinaries index, as companies regain their profitability, repair their balance sheets and get ready to invest in a larger way which would secure higher aggregate levels of employment for us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that growth alone will not repair the problem of the long-term unemployed. In fact, at a meeting in the last week or so, the G7 ministers agreed that growth alone will not deal with the problem of unemployment, particularly the long-term unemployed. That is, in the case of some European countries&mdash;Britain comes to mind as one with a high level of unemployment&mdash;it has had no impact whatsoever on wages or wages growth, because these people are now no longer regarded as part of the labour market. They have been sidelined. They have become an underclass. They have no attachment to the labour market and, therefore, they are not an economic variable in terms of wages, productivity, growth or anything else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means two things. One is that it is imperative to get back to higher rates of growth because higher rates of growth will provide aggregate jobs to reduce unemployment. That is reducing the stock of long-term unemployed people, but it will not necessarily deal with the long-term unemployed. That is one of the issues that is the focus of the committee on employment opportunities which I met with this morning to discuss progress in preparing the discussion paper on employment. Having talked to the prime ministers of Britain and Ireland and the President of the United States on this last visit about the problem, I am convinced that Australia can be at the forefront of tackling the challenge and finding ways to address the problem of unemployment and particularly long-term unemployment.</PARA>

In the same period of time, 1.6 million jobs were created in this country. To get an appropriate equivalent, one multiplies the Australian figure by four. That would put us in a position of being the equivalent of about 6.5 million jobs in the United Kingdom. In the course of the recession we have lost some 200,000 to 300,000 of those jobs in contrast to the British position of losing about half.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Clarke realises that, for the British and the Europeans to be able to deal with a situation that they will find increasingly serious over the next 24 months, they will require active measures of their governments in order to keep the work force, which is out of work, competitive, to retrain those who have been structurally adjusted out of the work force to be able to get back into the work force and to provide growth which is absolutely the underpinning of any improvement in employment at all. That is very much the position that this government would accept as the appropriate approach to dealing with the problems that are confronting the Europeans and, to a lesser but nevertheless serious extent, confront us here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a variety of views in the community as to what the government ought to do in defining its intentions on these matters. A recent comment, for example, from Professor Sloan&mdash;if the headlines are to be believed&mdash;said that labour market programs do not create work. She is quite wrong about that; they do. The government's new enterprise incentive scheme creates new small businesses which employ additional people. The jobskills program and LEAP are fully additional to work force numbers; they are not simply a process whereby unemployed people are selected to get the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wage subsidies offered through jobstart programs bring forward employment opportunities. Whilst there is some displacement in this area, in particular, from the work force&mdash;some unemployed people get jobs that others would have got were those subsidies not offered&mdash;the displacement rate is not 100 per cent. So there is additional employment through those processes. That part of Professor Sloan's comments was quite erroneous. I would agree wholeheartedly with other parts of what she has said. She also said that labour market programs ought to be pursued in the work force for equity and efficiency reasons. It is essential, in terms of equity and efficiency, to provide everybody with an opportunity to work because, without a competitive labour market, with each recession unemployment plateaus at higher and higher levels.</PARA>

There is a debate, not only in this country but elsewhere, of a remarkably similar character. One of the problems is that among no group of conservatives anywhere, except here, is a government not required to undertake active measures in the labour market to encourage people back into work and provide opportunities for them. Alone among all the conservative parties in this country is the opposition's position of savagely slashing labour market programs on which, in comparison with those in Europe, as a percentage of GDP, we do not spend as much.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to amend the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991, the ESOS Act, to strengthen the protection afforded to international students' pre-paid fees. The need for this was highlighted by the closure of the Australian Business College in Perth in February 1993. This closure and the absence of money from the special account meant that about 350 overseas students in Australia and up to 100 still off-shore lost moneys totalling up to $2.2 million. Because of the special circumstances of the closure, this loss was made good by a special Commonwealth appropriation. The Commonwealth should not be placed in this situation again. The industry must look after its own. Legislation is also required in the current sittings to address the act's 1 January 1994 sunset clause. There is now little medium term prospect of industry self-regulation or of state and territory regulation replacing Commonwealth regulation. Industry supports continuation of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will strengthen the ESOS Act by requiring private education providers to maintain trust accounts, not just special accounts, for students' pre-paid funds; to adhere to limits on draw downs from those trust accounts to ensure that if they default there is enough for refunds; to adhere to more prescriptive refund provisions if they fail to provide the course, or if a student withdraws from the course; and to be in an industry-run tuition assurance scheme to guarantee that international students receive the courses paid for if a provider defaults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Details of the tuition assurance scheme are being developed by a government-industry working group. They will be prescribed in the regulations under the act later this year. The scheme will be run and funded by the industry, although $3.1 million was appropriated in the 1993 budget to provide Commonwealth financial assistance in its establishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major amendment will introduce prison penalties for current monetary penalties for certain breaches of the act. This follows from advice from authorities investigating the closure of the Australian Business College in Perth that penalties needed to be stiffened. Increasing the penalties to imprisonment allows the court to impose a monetary penalty in addition to, or instead of, the term of imprisonment in accordance with the formula provided in the Crimes Act 1914. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional amendments include allowing more flexibility in rolling back the financial regulation sections of the act in favour of equivalent state and territory arrangements; providing a sanction when a suspended provider ignores the act's requirement that it not recruit new overseas students; changing the definition of an overseas student so that it clearly excludes those studying on a visitor's visa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is the product of extensive consultation with the international education industry, including seminars in major capital cities and discussions with the National Consultative Committee on International Education and Training Services. It has also been shaped by the attentions of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, especially the committee's December 1992 report on its inquiry into the operation of the ESOS Act.

Legal advice indicated that the requirement for members of the scheme to pay membership or other fees could be viewed as a form of taxation and that it required specific legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also finalises the full implementation of the national equity program for schools for 1994, including the broadbanding provisions endorsed by the Australian Education Council which provide financial assistance under four elements focused on access, equity, national priorities and incentives. Following agreement with school authorities, these new provisions will replace the interim arrangements that existed in 1993. The bill provides for a number of other changes: strengthening the Commonwealth's new schools policy for funding new and changing non-government schools; and limiting eligibility for Commonwealth general recurrent funding to those students enrolled at non-government schools and attending those schools on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, this bill will provide funding schedules for programs under the national equity program for schools and joint programs to support primary and secondary education for the remainder of the 1993 to 1996 funding period.

<PARA>The Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 focuses on implementing some 1993 federal election initiatives and initiatives announced in the 1993 budget. The bill also provides for some minor policy changes and technical amendments to further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of social security administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the 1993 federal election, the government announced that it would introduce new payment arrangements for long-term unemployed clients aged 60 and over, but below pension age. The commitment was made in recognition of the difficulties faced by older unemployed people in the current labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 20 March 1994, any person aged 60 and over who has not reached pension age, is unemployed, has been registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service for the last 12 months and has been receiving income support payments for the last 12 months will be able to claim a mature age allowance. The person will have to be in Australia and satisfy the age pension residency requirement of 10 years qualifying Australian residence. The person's partner might also be qualified to receive a mature age partner allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transfer to the new allowance will be voluntary. Unlike the conditions that apply to newstart allowance, a person being paid the mature age allowance will not have to satisfy an activity test or stay registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. However, a person might wish to remain registered so as to use any assistance the Commonwealth Employment Service provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mature age allowance will be paid at age pension rates and be subject to the pension income and assets tests. Some of the other main features of the new allowance are that allowees will have access to the pensioner earnings credit scheme, and pensioner tax rebates will also apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recognises that the need for the mature age allowance could diminish when the economy recovers. To that end, legislation providing for the allowance will be subject to a sunset clause of 30 June 1996, after which time no new claims may be lodged. Existing recipients will not be affected. Continuation of the arrangements will be reviewed in 1994-95 in the light of prevailing labour market conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also gives effect to an election commitment announced by the Prime Minister in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS> to provide an incentive for social security allowance recipients and their partners to earn moderate casual or part-time income without automatically affecting their income support payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowance clients being paid at the maximum rate will be able to build up credit of up to $500 that can be offset against income from employment. Couples will be able to build up a maximum credit of $500 each. For a single person, credit will accrue at the rate of $90 a fortnight. Credit for each member of a couple will accrue at $80 a fortnight. The credits will not be transferable between partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Credits may be used provided the person's earnings from employment and other income fall below the income test cut-out point for that person for the fortnight in question. For those earning above the cut-out points in a given fortnight, credits may not be accessed but will be `preserved' for up to 13 weeks and can be accessed at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Newstart allowance was introduced in July 1991 with the objective of assisting the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed and those with labour market disadvantages, to return to paid employment and so reduce their dependency on income support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A requirement of newstart's implementation was that an interim evaluation report be presented in the 1993-94 budget context. The report indicated that newstart has produced some impressive results, including 1.7 million job referrals, over 430,000 placements on labour market programs and 320,000 job placements. As part of the interim evaluation, a post-implementation review was conducted. In general, the review found that both staff and clients see newstart as an improvement on the old arrangements, but officers of the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service felt that the positive aspects could be better used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures, to be implemented progressively from September 1993 to September 1994, will reinforce the key objective of the newstart strategy: namely, to help those on social security payments to maintain their job search efforts and move into jobs. In summary, those measures will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">improve the selection processes for client contacts to ensure the early identification and assessment of clients with labour market disadvantages;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">provide more effective case management for all newstart clients, particularly those with a labour market disadvantage;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">enhance compliance and review activity to reinforce client obligations to make genuine efforts to find work, undertake training and generally improve job prospects;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">improve client assistance and service delivery; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">improve liaison between the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service. </PARA>
<PARA>The implementation of some of these measures requires legislation and the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 provides the first step in doing this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 provides for the introduction from 1 January 1994 of a $200 education entry payment for newstart allowance clients and jobsearch allowance clients under 18 who have been registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service as unemployed for at least 12 months and who enrol in a full-time course of education that is an approved course under the Austudy or Abstudy schemes. The payment will assist with the up-front costs of taking up study, such as enrolment fees, purchasing books, student union fees and course fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people, such as those who have lived or worked overseas, may be entitled to income support from another country. Presently, it is not a general requirement for the grant or continued payment of an Australian pension that people claim or pursue their entitlement from another country, even from countries with which Australia has social security agreements based on shared responsibility. From 20 March 1994, if the Secretary to the Department of Social Security thinks a person or that person's partner would be entitled to a payment from a specified country, it will be necessary for the person or that partner to take reasonable steps to obtain the maximum payment from that country. The overall result will be a reduced dependence on Australian social security pensions when payments are also available from specified countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is concerned to ensure that the debt recovery provisions set out in the Social Security Act 1991 operate not only efficiently and effectively but with fairness. With those objectives in mind, the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 will amend the Social Security Act 1991 from 1 January 1994 to implement a number of initiatives announced in the 1993 budget relating to debt recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance and sickness allowance clients are paid according to the number of days for which they are entitled to payment. If a client does not tell the department he or she has started work or received income, any calculation of overpayment begins from the day after this `notifiable event' occurred. Amendments will provide for the calculation of the overpayment to start on the day the notifiable event occurs, rather than the day after and will bring the treatment of overpayments into line with the payment of arrears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dual payments, for example, where a client obtains a replacement cheque&mdash;on the basis that the original cheque has not been received&mdash;but subsequently obtains value for not only the replacement cheque but also the original, will be recoverable in the same way as many other debts, for example, from continuing payments or by garnishee. The recovery of debts arising from fraudulent negotiation of cheques by a third party will be streamlined by allowing recovery using existing powers under the Social Security Act 1991. This will avoid the need for costly civil action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Act 1991 generally excludes dual entitlement to social security income support and other government income support payments such as compensation and service pension. However, unless a client commits a breach of a provision of the act or misrepresents his or her situation, a debt arises only where there are dual social security payments or concurrent payments of a social security payment and a service pension. Amendments will extend the debt recovery provisions to allow recovery of all payments covered by multiple entitlement exclusion provisions, such as Austudy and war widows pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, fraudulently obtained payments can only be recovered from the Department of Social Security client who actually received them unless another departmental client agrees to recovery from his or her own payment. The Department of Social Security has been criticised by the courts in a number of cases&mdash;specifically, for not taking action against partners who were knowingly involved in payments being fraudulently obtained by Department of Social Security clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments will allow a debt to be recovered from another person, usually a partner, where that person has benefited from and been knowingly involved in the fraudulent obtaining of moneys by the Department of Social Security client, provided that the involvement of the other person has first been established through criminal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for a number of measures concerning the treatment of compensation payments for social security purposes. They are intended, generally, to preserve the integrity and effectiveness of the existing provisions. One of the more significant measures will be to bring within the provisions lump sum compensation payments whether or not they contain an economic loss component. A great majority of lump sum compensation payments contain economic loss amounts. Those payments are, and will continue to be, covered by the compensation provisions. The so-called 50 per cent rule will remain whereby half the total lump sum will continue to be disregarded for social security entitlement purposes. It is clear, however, that compensation settlements are being entered into such that they avoid, or attempt to avoid, the compensation provisions. The government has acted and will continue to act to ensure that people who receive compensation payments use them for their support, at least for a reasonable period of time, before calling on the taxpayer funded social security system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important change is to use a new divisor within the statutory formula that deals with the treatment of lump sums. The employees&mdash;all persons&mdash;average weekly earnings figure is to replace the `all male' figure. The all persons figure is more likely to reflect the level of ordinary wages in the occupational classifications most likely to sustain work related injuries and recognises the fact of women's participation in the work force and the incidence of motor vehicle accidents across the general population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another change will limit the exemption from the provisions dealing with personal sickness and accident insurance policies. Some of these policies pay policy holders an amount less an amount of income support received from the Department of Social Security in the period covered by the policy. It is not acceptable that insurance companies should be able to shift part of their costs in this way onto the taxpayer. The bill also, among other things, standardises the treatment of wife pensioners in compensation cases, clarifies the `event' that might give rise to the entitlement to compensation and tackles certain cost-shifting type provisions in state and territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rent assistance waiting periods were abolished from March 1992 for nearly all eligible clients. However, at present, young people under 18 who have lodged a claim and are qualified for the homeless or independent rates of jobsearch allowance and sickness allowance must serve a waiting period of 18 weeks before rent assistance is payable. This bill gives effect to the government's decision to abolish the 18-week waiting period for this latter group from 20 March 1994. This measure will make it easier for these young people to access secure accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has decided that from 1 January 1994 all secondary school students born after 31 December 1977, apart from those students who attract Austudy paid at the independent or away from home rate, or who are homeless, will instead remain within the social security system until they turn 17. Most students will become eligible to attract family payment at the new rate that will apply from 1 January 1994 of $123.90 a fortnight for their caregiver. Those secondary school students who are homeless will be eligible for special benefit. On their 17th birthday, secondary school students will be able to claim Austudy. This bill gives effect to that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security issues millions of statutory notices each year to various groups of clients. Most of the notices require clients to notify certain relevant changes to their circumstances and an overpayment results if a client fails to do so. The Social Security Appeals Tribunal&mdash;the SSAT&mdash;has indicated what it regards as potential technical deficiencies in the department's notices with the result that the SSAT has found against the department in many overpayment cases on the grounds that the notices are deficient. Given that the cost implications for the Commonwealth are significant, probably in excess of $50 million per year, it is proposed that prompt legislative action be taken to resolve this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments contained in the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 make it clear that a notice will not be invalid merely because it may fail to specify the manner in which a person must comply with it or because it does not describe itself as a `recipient notification notice' or `recipient statement notice'. In addition to protecting the revenue, these amendments are important as a matter of equity. Many people responded to these notices and gave the department information that brought about a reduction in their social security payments. Others ignored the notices and failed to notify the department of named events or changes in circumstances. It would be unfair to those who did comply with the notices to relieve others from the consequences of their failure to notify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1991 the powers of the Secretary to the Department of Social Security to waive a debt have been guided by ministerial direction in two successive disallowable instruments tabled in and allowed by the parliament. Only very recently the Federal Court decided in Riddell v Secretary to the Department of Social Security to set aside the 1991 ministerial direction on the grounds that it was invalid and indicated that it would do the same to the 1992 direction if it came before the court. This has left decision makers and tribunals with no guidelines on how to decide if a debt may be waived and, potentially, it has significant cost implications for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill addresses these problems by amending the Social Security Act 1991 to include the grounds for waiver in the act itself. One of the grounds in the act will be more generous than it was previously. Waiver of a debt will occur where the debt arises solely because of administrative error of the Commonwealth and the money was received in good faith. Previously, it was also necessary that recovery would cause financial hardship before waiver could occur. On the other hand, there will now be no general power to waive because of special circumstances. The circumstances listed in the bill provide a code for making waiver decisions. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ideas for changes or improvements to the act are constantly being made as a result of the unusually large number of agencies with a direct interest in the act and the level of scrutiny given by parliamentarians and others. As a result, the act has been amended on several occasions since its enactment in 1990. The Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 makes further changes to the act to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data matching by, among other things, permitting tax file numbers to be used by assistance agencies in discussions with the Australian Taxation Office when following up discrepancies; better clarifying certain definitions and the source of authority for payments of Commonwealth assistance; and correcting some minor oversights. However, the most significant change will be to repeal the sunset provision in the act so as to permit the data matching program to continue beyond 22 January 1994. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

The first deals with the government's budget announcement concerning eligibility for benefits under the veterans' children education scheme.

It is proposed to extend the sunset clause which governs the operation of advance pharmaceutical allowance. These  provisions allow a lump sum payment of pharmaceutical allowance of up to seven payments to be made to chronically ill pensioners who have a high prescription drug use. Without this extension the sunset clause would repeal advance pharmaceutical allowance from 1 January 1994.

The last of the three non-budget amendments will change the definition of shares and listed securities. This definition was inserted into the act to provide that the income and assets value of shares was assessed in accordance with the managed investment rules.

<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to implement the EC-Australia wine agreement. On 6 December 1992, I jointly announced with our wine industry that Australian and European Commission officials had negotiated the text of a bilateral wine agreement aimed at improving our bilateral wine trade. This announcement attracted wide media attention, and rightly so, as the European Community is Australia's largest export market for wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> During 1992-93, Australian winemakers exported 44 million litres worth $144 million to the EC, or almost half of our total exports of $293 million. This agreement will guarantee our continued access to the EC market which will remain the key market as our wine industry strives to lift exports to $1 billion by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This agreement is a vital part of the strategy to further lift exports. As I have said, the target is $1 billion by the year 2000. It should not be forgotten that we have increased exports fourteenfold since 1985-86 from $21 million to the $293 million to which I previously referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation enables the agreement to enter into force and our winemakers to enjoy its benefits. The agreement provides for the mutual recognition of each party's winemaking practices and standards; it affords mutual protection to each party's geographical indications&mdash;that is, the names of our wine regions such as Coonawarra and Hunter Valley; it reduces the number of analyses the EC requires of Australian wines from eight to three; it allows Australian winemakers to market wines in the EC labelled with multi-varietal and multi-regional blends; and it allows the export of Australian sweet wines, such as the justly famous De Bortoli `Noble One', to the European Community, which was previously not permitted. Importantly, it prevents either party from introducing additional certification requirements on imports of each other's wines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement recognises the importance of European geographical indications to the European Community. It also recognises the widespread use of EC names on Australian wines.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four tranches of EC names to be protected. A list of thousands of EC geographical names which are of no commercial significance to us will be protected immediately the agreement enters into force. The second tranche is of little used names, such as `Frascati' and `White Bordeaux', which will be phased out on 31 December this year. A further group of names of some importance to us, such as `Chianti' and `Madeira' must be phased out by 31 December 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last tranche includes names which are widely used by our winemakers, names like `Claret', `Chablis' `Burgundy' and `Champagne'. Phase-out periods for these names have yet to be determined but the agreement provides that negotiations on phase-out dates for these names must be concluded by 31 December 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have used European geographical names to denote a style of wine for more than a hundred years. Migrants often brought these names to Australia and used them to describe a familiar style of wine; the names have become generic. Names like `champagne' have been used to describe a dry sparkling wine. Once protection commences, both European and Australian geographical indications will only be used to indicate the true place of origin of the wine. Thus the name `champagne' will only be used to describe wine made in the Champagne region of France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement provides for additional phase-out periods to clear stock from wholesalers and retailers. Australian wine made prior to the phase-out period for production labelled with the protected EC names may be marketed by wholesalers for up to three years and by retailers until stocks are exhausted. Australian winemakers have already begun using varietal and brand names to replace European geographical indications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for the protection of traditional wine expressions. Words such as `brut' or `reserve' are frequently used to indicate a certain quality or style of wine. Under the bill, traditional expressions may only be used to describe wine which originates in the country in which the expression has been traditionally and consistently used. The lists of both Australian and EC traditional expressions are still under negotiation by the two parties to the agreement. The bill provides for protection to commence when the traditional expressions are entered in a register. This will occur after negotiations on protection of traditional names are concluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement has the strong support of the peak wine industry body, the Winemakers Federation of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill establishes a Geographical Indications Committee to determine the boundaries of Australian geographical indications.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where does Coonawarra end and Riverland start? This question is just as relevant for Australian wine consumers as it is for the EC requirements. By defining the boundaries of our geographical indications, this bill will give greater certainty to enforcement of the label integrity program provisions of the act, which require winemakers to keep records to substantiate label claims of the vintage, variety or geographical indication of wine. The bill will give consumers the guarantee that when wine is labelled `Coonawarra', the grapes from which the wine was made came from within the defined boundaries of the Coonawarra region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Geographical Indications Committee will comprise a Winemakers Federation of Australia nominee, a nominee of the Wine Grape Growers Council of Australia and an Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, AWBC, nominee.

The NFA application, even if accepted in its entirety, will not authorise all EC winemaking practices. There are some EC standards which the Australian wine industry does not want to adopt for wine made in Australia. The bill authorises the import of wine from the EC which conforms with the compositional requirements set down in the agreement and allows these standards to be varied from time to time by agreement as EC winemaking practices change. The EC practices differ in minor ways and in ways which do not affect health, from the standards set by the National Food Authority for sale of Australian and imported wine. EC wine will still have to comply in all other respects with Australian standards, for example with regard to labelling with alcoholic content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EC-Australia wine agreement is the first of several agreements on wine we intend to conclude with our major wine trading partners. Work is already under way on developing a wine agreement with New Zealand. The bill therefore amends the objects of the act to include implementing the EC-Australia wine agreement; enabling Australia to implement further international agreements relating to trade in wine; and defining Australian geographical indications for wine. It extends the powers and functions of the AWBC to cover administration of the EC-Australia wine agreement and the definition of Australian geographical indications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill creates several new offences. The offences include the false or misleading use of geographical indications and traditional expressions for wine. However, winemakers will continue to be able to use their individual name and the individual name of their predecessor in business, in the course of trade, even where that name is the same as the name of a protected geographical indication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the act to allow regulations to be made concerning blending rules for wine and the composition of export wine. These regulations will not be activated until there has been further consultation with the wine industry, the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and the National Food Authority. The bill also allows the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation to prescribe the grape varieties which may be used in making wine. This will prevent the use of hybrid grape varieties in export wine, which is a concern in some export markets. The bill will have no financial impact. </PARA>

For CSL to compete effectively in the international marketplace and to achieve its full growth potential, it requires greater financial and management flexibility to secure capital and pursue its internationalisation goals.

<PARA>This bill amends the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988, the ALTD Act, to extend the operation of the Australian land transport development trust fund. The Commonwealth government is allocating some $2.46 billion to fund roadworks on national highways over the three calendar years from 1 January 1994. This amendment will allow this to be funded from the current ALTD Act until new legislation is in force governing the new roads program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will not alter the government's commitment to develop a new national highway act during 1994 to replace the ALTD Act 1988. The national highway act will create a more efficient road management system, with potentially great benefits to the taxpayer and road users. As part of this government's commitment to creating an appropriate roads administration program, a full consultative process is under way, involving state governments and major industry bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, in developing the national highway bill the government will be taking into account reports from the Australian National Audit Office and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, both due to report to parliament later this year. As a result, the national highway bill for the post-1993 roads program will probably be introduced near the end of the current period of sittings, or early in the following period, with consideration and passage in 1994. Hence it is necessary to amend the ALTD Act to extend its operation and ensure that the federal roads program can continue to be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of this amendment will not alter the government's intention to fund the national highway system only from 1 January 1994.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Childcare Rebate Bill 1993 will provide for the payment of rebates for expenses incurred for work related child care as announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 9 February 1993. This bill realises a key election promise to the families of Australia. It is another promise made and kept. The cash rebate is a major plank in this government's commitment to increase the number of child-care places, to make child care more affordable and to increase the choices for Australian families. It is an investment in our future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government recognises that women are unable to participate actively in the work force unless they have access to affordable child care. The skills of women with work force experience are extremely valuable in an economy dependent on the training and flexibility of the work force. The cash rebate will substantially increase the ability of women to work and to undertake further study and training. In short, it will allow them to contribute the full wealth of their talents and abilities to national growth and prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child care is no longer a welfare issue. It is now an integral part of the government's approach to building a highly skilled and adaptable work force. The child-care rebate is part of the Labor government's comprehensive child-care policy. It recognises that most parents need quality child care at some stage of their working lives and that they need help with the cost of child care. The rebate will significantly improve the affordability of child care for working parents. It builds on this government's outstanding record of assisting families with dependent children through its support for child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Labor government was elected in 1983 there were just 46,000 operational child-care places. There are now more than 208,000 child-care places in Australia. Budget funding for an additional 29,000 places will lift the number to approximately 237,000 by the end of this financial year. This government has also promised to meet all demand for work related child care by the year 2001. This will mean an increase in places to more than 300,000 by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And we have put money where our mouth is. Commonwealth outlays have grown from $65 million in 1982-83 to over $550 million this financial year. As the places have grown, we have ensured that ordinary Australian families can afford to use the child-care facilities. This year alone, an estimated 170,000 low and middle income families will benefit from long day care child-care assistance of up to $108.50 a week. As well, the government has extended the more generous long day care child-care assistance to directly Commonwealth funded occasional care centres from 1 July 1993. This has benefited a further 20,000 low and middle income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1993 the Prime Minister announced further initiatives to build on Labor's child-care commitment to families. These included:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">the establishment of a care for sick children program. This will help employers establish sick care facilities and provide for suitable separate sick care facilities in child-care centres and family day care schemes. </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">To keep child care affordable, the fringe benefits tax exemption was also extended to approved employer sponsored family day care, outside school hours care and vacation care services on 1 July 1993. The 1993 budget legislation includes sales tax exemptions for goods used by child-care services. </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">To ensure quality care for Australian children, the new accreditation and quality assurance system will be implemented in child-care centres from 1 January 1994. This fulfils yet another election commitment. The 1993 budget provides funding to implement these initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>The Childcare Rebate Bill 1993 is another important step to ensure that child care is affordable for all working families. Many families do not currently receive any government financial assistance for child care because their joint family income exceeds the threshold for child-care assistance or because they use informal care. From 1 July 1994, parents using child care while in employment, training, studying or looking for work will be able to claim a rebate for part of their child-care expenses. An estimated 230,000 families with 358,000 children will benefit from the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister said in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the Nation</EMPHASIS>, the child-care rebate recognises that the cost of child care is a legitimate expense for parents earning an income. Just like other concessions for expenses incurred in earning an income, it will not be means tested. Tax deductions of $4.9 billion each year are provided for work related expenses, such as subscriptions for professional associations and trade unions, car expenses and professional libraries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the child-care rebate is a long overdue recognition of the costs of child care borne by parents, and particularly mothers, in earning an income. This bill recognises that all working families are entitled to some recompense against the cost of work related child care. And to ensure that the benefits flow on to low income families, the government took the more equitable decision to provide this assistance as a cash rebate. This will assist low income women and families because the rebate will be able to be claimed as the expense is incurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A deduction would have forced many families to carry these costs for more than a year before they could claim any benefit. It would also have provided greatest benefits to higher income earners. People below the tax threshold would not have benefited at all. Instead, the use of a rebate ties the level of the benefit to the cost of child care incurred by the parent and not to the level of taxable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rebate will be payable fortnightly through Medicare offices of the Health Insurance Commission. Eligible families will pay the first $16 of weekly child-care costs and then be able to claim 30 per cent of their costs up to a fee ceiling of $110 per week for one child in care or $220 per week for two or more children in care. The maximum weekly rebate will be $28.20 per week for one child, or $1,466 per year, and $61.20 per week for two or more children, or $3,182 per year. The cash rebate is paid over and above child-care assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rebate will be paid for all work related child-care expenses for children aged up to 12 years of age. Child-care expenses incurred by working parents in long day care centres, preschools, family day care, outside school hours care, vacation care and private child-care arrangements will be eligible for the rebate. Child-care expenses incurred in care services not eligible for government assistance have also been included in recognition of the fact that almost two-thirds of working families use these care arrangements, either by choice or because formal care is not available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Care can be provided in either the child's home or another person's home. Carers must be over 18 years old, and parents are excluded from claiming the cost of caring for their own children.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child-care providers, whether in formal child-care services or at home, will be required to register with the Health Insurance Commission through Medicare offices and provide proof of age, proof of compliance with relevant state licensing requirements and a declaration that they have a tax file number. Carers will be given a child-care provider number which must be quoted when issuing receipts for child-care payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To address the privacy concerns of parents and care providers, the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) has been consulting with the Privacy Commissioner. Let me stress that at no time will parents or providers be required to give details of their actual tax file number to the HIC. All they have to do is state whether they have a tax file number. The registration form for care providers will require a declaration that the care provider has a tax file number. If a carer provides a tax file number, the Health Insurance Commission must not record the information. Carers who advise that they have a tax file number will be given a care provider number which they must quote when issuing receipts for child-care expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families will be required to substantiate their work force status and the birth dates of their children. Families will have the option of allowing the Health Insurance Commission to use Medicare enrolment details to verify birth dates of children. Families will register with the Health Insurance Commission and be issued with a family registration number. Families will be able to claim the rebate by mail or in person at any one of 240 Medicare offices around Australia, in a similar fashion to the Medicare rebate. This will mean they will be able to get the rebate immediately across the counter. This arrangement will not only be familiar to many families but also reduce the need to establish a separate service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To enable the Health Insurance Commission to begin preparations for the child-care rebate, the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Act 1993 was passed during the autumn sittings earlier this year. This government is committed to enabling parents to fulfil both their work and family responsibilities by ensuring that quality child care is affordable and accessible. The child-care rebate is a central part of that commitment. I have great pleasure in commending this historic bill to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, given that you were in the chair earlier today prior to the interruption of debate on the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Limited Sale Bill, I had sketched some of the background and current financial status of the corporation. Moreover, I foreshadowed some initial reservations and concerns that the coalition opposition had in regard to the bill before the House. More specifically, I would like now to outline in some detail why the opposition believes there is a whole range of unanswered questions and a number of potential difficulties in regard to the sale of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, otherwise known as SMEC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point for the coalition in privatising any government business is simply that, when a commercial sale takes place, it has to be that&mdash;commercially based and commercially presented. But what do we have in this bill? We have a staff buyout of the corporation, which the coalition has long supported, which raises more questions and issues than it answers. It is no wonder, in view of this, that negotiations over the sale of SMEC have been so drawn out for so long. All I can say is thank heavens SMEC was not a significant performing asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The staff buyout, which will be by way of Tinbury Ltd, a company formed by SMEC's employees, is to proceed on a basis which reduces the purchase price of the corporation as a going concern; that is, in order to lower the sale price the federal government is prepared to extinguish accumulated tax losses in exchange for recoupment through company tax at a later stage. There is nothing necessarily wrong about this process, but the bill tells us nothing about the extent of these tax losses, their likely impact on the Commonwealth's return from the sale, and the precedence for the Commonwealth acting in this way in the matter of the disposal of public business assets. Irrespective of SMEC's future, which is far from assured, is $1 million&mdash;SMEC's expected sale price&mdash;a decent return on a company about which we cannot even determine, for reasons I will explain shortly, the real value of its assets base? It is nothing more than a simple question which requires a simple answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government knows the SMEC deal might fall through and the staff buyout might not be completed. The bill therefore provides for alternatives such as a trade sale. But, again, all of this is in the future, as are the terms on which eventual deals with whomever will eventually be struck. The bill now before the House has nothing to say about the details of these matters whatsoever. On this basis, I have no idea why the federal government is proceeding with legislation in anticipation of processes which are yet to unfold and about which the parliament knows nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at one of the other issues raised in the legislation. The bill provides for the SMEC's sale to Tinbury&mdash;in the event that such a sale takes place&mdash;to be overturned and a money back guarantee provided should SMEC face liabilities arising from current legal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all members may know, but in 1990 Victoria's Dartmouth Dam was forced to close after a serious construction related failure at the site which destroyed the hydro-electricity plant's generating facilities. In fact, only last week, by coincidence, after four years and some $94 million in costs, the dam was reopened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister did mention this crucial matter briefly in his second reading speech and referred the House to SMEC's annual reports for further detail. Regrettably, as with most public bodies, the usefulness of SMEC's annual report in providing detail and objective and critical commentary on its own activities is paltry and the reference the minister cites is of no help whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding this, as a result of the incident at Dartmouth Dam, the State Electricity Corporation of Victoria is suing several parties, including SMEC. Other parties have cross-claims targeting SMEC as well. The claims well exceed the corporation's own insurance cover and could lead to its liquidation. If this occurs, the Commonwealth&mdash;which has limited exposure to the legal claim, as I mentioned&mdash;intends through this bill to provide a money back guarantee to Tinbury, should it successfully buy out the corporation. Of course, with overhanging liabilities of this order, the actual value of SMEC's asset base&mdash;now at $9 million in net terms&mdash;is also questionable, a matter which further complicates the sale of the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now debating a sale bill which provides no detail whatsoever and which is simply envisaging a series of probable sale outcomes and other imponderables. On this basis, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) would have done well to have resisted calling the proposed sale of SMEC a key feature of the government's micro-economic reform agenda. The sale was forced on the government as the corporation fell over. The sale is nowhere close to being settled. Even the staff buyout proposal presented as the first option for the sale was adopted by the government only after the coalition promoted such a position. So this bill is not part of a systematic micro reform program; it is a hurried push to clear an asset off the books even before all the preparatory homework has been completed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Limited Sale Bill today, we are dealing with an organisation which is unique in Australian history and has provided very great benefits for the states of Victoria and New South Wales. I think it has been responsible for achievements of which every single Australian is enormously proud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with some degree of unpleasantness that I reflect upon the fact that, while our great athletes are lauded, great tributes are paid to them and they receive the general adulation of the greater Australian community, the people who have done so much over a protracted period of time to provide the substance and the backbone of the nation have been left as unsung heroes. When we move into committee I intend to move a small amendment because we are very worried that the results of this sale could result in the dismemberment of this corporation which has provided such an enormous benefit for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shire councils in North Queensland have formed themselves into the North Australia Water Development Council to move along the development of a scheme often referred to as the Bradfield scheme. The scheme has been revised very dramatically from a report by a team of engineers&mdash;Gutteridge Haskins and Davey, Monro and Johnson, McIntyre and Associates and Cameron McNamara&mdash;to the Queensland government in 1984. That, plus the report done by the Office of Northern Development, indicated clearly, as much as anyone can project these things with very hard figures, that an outlay, a net capital cost, of $2.49 thousand million would produce an annual gross revenue&mdash;value of production, if you like&mdash;of $2.02 thousand million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revised Bradfield scheme was originally announced by the then Queensland government, and the then federal government under Malcolm Fraser put some $5 million into prefeasibility reports on the project. The whole of Australia welcomed the scheme with open arms and very great adulation. I might even use that very strong expression to describe the reaction of the Australian people. I and two other people&mdash;Dr Heidecker from Queensland University and Mr Roy Stainkey, a very prominent person in grazing circles in Queensland&mdash;received some 200 requests from the media to do interviews during the next week to two weeks, which showed similar massive universal reaction to the scheme as there was to the Snowy Mountains Authority project. For the first time, some hard figures exist on proposals that will work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Senator Walsh was a great person for denigrating the scheme and referring to me and others as people who made water run uphill. So it probably bears comment that the major dam called Hell's Gates in the Burdekin River has a full supply level of 1,279 feet whereas the water is delivered onto the western plains below Hughenden at 1,079 feet. That is a sufficient head to give a flow of water from one point to the other, over 500 or 600 kilometres of canal. We are not trying to make water run uphill. In fact, we are facilitating the water to run downhill where it can be used away from areas where enormous damage can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have said is relevant to the bill before the House because, if the talent and the accumulated wisdom are scattered to the four winds as a result of what is happening in the House today, we will not have the reservoir of knowledge and experience that is needed to undertake a scheme of this magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The computer program models that have to be put together to work out how much water will fall over at the point of exit and how much water can be taken out and delivered to a farm some 400 or 500 kilometres away are very complicated. We need to deal with people who know what they are doing and who are extremely experienced in this area. An engineering firm is extremely lucky if it gets to build a dam every two or three decades. It would be a very rare engineering firm that would have that honour. We have here a group of engineers who are doing this sort of work on a continuing basis not only in Australia but also overseas. The SMEC engineers&mdash;the engineering companies that undertook the project at the time&mdash;worked on the revised Bradfield proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appalling that, once again, we find ourselves in the depths of a recession&mdash;in exactly the same position as we were in the 1930s&mdash;making exactly the same mistakes. It is deeply regrettable that the 223 people who represent Australia in this House and in the other place are not aware of the economic history of our nation. This stands in stark contrast with the performance of the United States government during the Depression when the Tennessee Valley Authority projects were undertaken and almost completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tennessee Valley Authority projects produced some 12,000 megawatts of electricity&mdash;not an awful lot less than we produce in the whole of Australia. The cost of that energy is nil because it is hydro-electric energy, the generation of which costs nothing. The building costs were also negligible. The workers at the time would have had to be paid unemployment benefits, so, in its wisdom, the United States government said that it was better to pay people to work rather than not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the United States had this magnificent series of projects which delivered water to the farm gate throughout the Tennessee Valley Authority areas. These projects produced a huge amount of hydro-electricity and controlled the enormous flood damage that had occurred regularly throughout that area. In addition, the United States government built the biggest dam in the world, the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River, and planted some 2,000 square miles of trees to revitalise the mid-western plains area which had been damaged by land degradation in early United States history. All of those wonderful things were done during the Depression in the United States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly right. In 1983-84 it rained and that is what caused the turnaround in Australia, not the change in government. And because it did not rain in 1981-82 and 1982-83, in 1982-83 alone the estimated losses were $7.5 billion, and I have extracts of figures that I can produce for the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1965-66 drought was of such dimensions that its effects were documented. The direct losses were estimated to be $1.5 billion. That would indicate, with a multiplier effect of two, that we have here losses approaching $4.5 billion at 1965 value. To equate that with today's value, we would need to double that figure and probably double it again in order to demonstrate the vast panorama of human destruction that was occasioned by that drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Snowy Mountains scheme enables us to drought-proof one-tenth&mdash;maybe as much as one-fifth&mdash;of the entire arable area of our nation, so that part of the continent which is not desert can be used productively. It is a disgrace to each and every Australian that almost one-fifth of the surface area of Queensland&mdash;this rich black soil varying in depth from 18 to 35 inches over this vast area of land&mdash;is presently producing virtually nothing of value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every single, solitary sugar mill in North Queensland has what is called a productivity council in the super wet belt between Townsville and Cairns&mdash;or between Ingham, Babinda and Gordonvale, if you like. The productivity council exists to try to come up with ways and means of dealing with the waterlogging and flooding problems in the super wet belt. Most of the towns in this area receive between 100 to 300 inches of rain every year and thus have an immense problem with flooding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the problem in Ingham is so serious that if that area had a simultaneous flood in the upper Herbert and in the lower Herbert&mdash;and this most certainly will happen&mdash;the emergency services predict the loss of some 250 lives. As luck would have it, in the last 100 years flooding has occurred twice in the lower Herbert and three times in the upper Herbert but has never occurred simultaneously. But that most certainly occurred in black man's history, in the history of the first Australians, because the legend for the Ingham area is water from mountain to mountain when the whole coastal plain went under water. That is exactly what will happen with a simultaneous flood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like in the Tennessee Valley, there is a very good reason why the flooding needs to be controlled. Cameron McNamara in the report on the Herbert River said that the losses were $30 million a year. Admittedly, that was in a series of very bad flood years, but the losses were quoted in that report as being $30 million a year just for one town, Ingham. And there are half a dozen towns of that size in the super wet belt. </PARA>

At the present time, we are making exactly the same mistakes that were made during the Great Depression in exactly the same place; that is, the federal parliament of Australia. In fact, it was one of the state governments that eventually showed the way&mdash;which, of course, America had taken seven years prior to us. America hardly expected over 20 per cent unemployment. At one stage, we had over 33 per cent unemployment in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The observations made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous) in his earlier comments deserve some answers. The reason we moved a second reading amendment, which has now been negatived by the House, was simply to emphasise the fact that in the sale of SMEC every effort should be made by the government&mdash;which is the responsible authority in this case&mdash;to ensure the public interest is fully protected. The parliamentary secretary has assured the House that the interests of the Commonwealth would be fully maintained, and we take him at his word.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case it is quite clear, as my colleague went to considerable lengths to explain, this is not just a straightforward privatisation project. It would be if it did not have the Dartmouth case hanging over it; but it does. The SMEC organisation has taken legal advice. If the case goes to court, SMEC will be there to defend its position. The outcome of any court proceeding is anybody's guess; certainly no-one in this chamber, nor anyone in the government at this stage, would know the outcome. Consequently, there are a number of imponderables which the opposition has quite rightly drawn attention to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those imponderables is the question: is it in the national interest and not just the Commonwealth's interest&mdash;as determined by this parliamentary secretary&mdash;to enter into an arrangement which would transfer the Commonwealth's interest in SMEC to Tinbury, or have we reached the stage, after six months of negotiation, when other alternatives need to be considered? But it is our responsibility on behalf of the Australian people to make sure that in this case the Commonwealth's interest in the widest sense of the term is adequately protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been pointed out in the second reading speech and the annual reports of SMEC, it is estimated that the value of SMEC's assets is somewhere around $8 million or $9 million. When we consider that most of its assets consist of 1950s generation buildings in Cooma, I wonder whether that figure may not be a little high. Nevertheless, if those figures are transferred for a sale price of around $1 million, as has been reported&mdash;and the parliamentary secretary has made the point that the sale price is well in excess of $1 million, and we will hold him to it because we sincerely hope that it is&mdash;then there is such a difference between the alleged figure for the sale price and the apparent figure for the asset basis of the organisation that we would be, to say the least, not acting in the national interest if we were not prepared to stand here and say that we would like to see a sale price which had some relevance to the apparent value of the enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the value of the enterprise is less than $8 million or $9 million, then that raises the other interesting question as to why those figures are being bandied about if they are not real. I say to the parliamentary secretary, who is not here for this debate&mdash;maybe he is listening, but that remains to be seen&mdash;that we raised the issue in an amendment simply to put on the record the fact that while we are allowing the passage of this legislation, because after all it is in conformity with the coalition's views on privatisation as well as the views expressed over the last three years by successive spokesmen for privatisation in relation to a staff buyout, they are two issues entirely separate from what the final price will be for the transfer of these assets. Those assets do not just belong to the staff of Tinbury or of SMEC; they belong to the people of Australia and we have a responsibility to make sure that they get fair value for money. </PARA>

<PARA>Companies state in their articles of association the reason why they are being formed and the rationale for their existence. I think that somewhere in here, where we are hiving off this corporation, there should be some statement by us as to how we see the corporation and how we would like it to see itself. This proposed new clause has no effect; it is purely a motherhood statement. But like the statement in the articles of association of a company, I think it has very great persuasive powers and will have some small but hopefully significant influence on how these people will see themselves in the future.

So I urge the parliamentary secretary in charge of taking this bill forward to accept and include this small clause, which I think gives some sort of comfort and significant status to these people who are going forward into a very challenging period for the corporation, which has been of such great importance to our state and nation in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 amends a number of acts. They are: the Disability Services Act 1986; the Health Insurance Act 1973; the Hearing Services Act 1991; the National Health Act 1953; the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992; the Nursing Homes and Hostels (Legislation Amendment) Act 1986; and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2 of this bill, namely clauses 3 to 5, deals with the Disability Services Act amendments; and part 8, namely clauses 28 to 52 inclusive, deals with amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act. I shall briefly address parts 3 to 7 inclusive first and then deal with parts 2 and 8 in turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses 6 to 13 of the bill amend certain aspects of the Health Insurance Act which particularly affect pathology authorities. These amendments are designed to do a number of things. Firstly, they ensure that not more than one pathology authority controls a pathology laboratory so that there can be no Medicare benefit double-dipping. Secondly, they require pathology authorities, in circumstances where practitioners leave an authority, to obtain request forms for pathology services. Thirdly, they impose penalties on pathology authorities for providing authority request forms which are different from the approved forms. Fourthly, they provide that a pathology authority which is a partly or wholly owned state, territory or public authority is not an approved pathology authority. Fifthly, they allow the relevant Minister for Health to review after 12 months a determination allowing an approved pathology authority to operate additional collection centres, and one amendment also extends to an authority a right of review of the minister's decision. Sixthly, they make a minor change to the way in which licence fees are reimbursed to an authority if permission to operate a collection centre is cancelled. The coalition does not oppose these technical amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 of the bill, clauses 14 to 17 inclusive, amends the Hearing Services Act to make it clear that war widows qualify for hearing services. It also gives protection to the official symbol of the Australian Hearing Services, and this symbol is covered by schedule 2 to the act. The coalition welcomes those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 5 of the bill, clauses 18 to 21 inclusive, amends the National Health Act to allow pharmacists who relocated before the 1990 restructuring arrangements to continue to supply pharmaceutical benefits, and also to allow the signatory, where approval is granted in these circumstances, to cancel approval for the earlier premises. I note that the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous) states that the objective of this measure is `to prevent an injustice which might otherwise occur'. The amendment has the effect of deeming, as approved, new premises of those approved pharmacists who relocated without obtaining approval. The coalition supports those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 6 is a minor amendment to the provisions relating to positions on the Australian Health Ethics Committee. Apparently the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 contains a typographical error. This is not actually stated in the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech. However, when reading the amendment in the bill, we are apprised that the purpose of the amendment before us today is to ensure that such nominations as are received for the National Health and Medical Research Council come from learned `academies' and not `academics' as the act presently states. The coalition will not oppose that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 7, clauses 24 to 27 inclusive, amends the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Act 1986 by repealing subsection 25(2) and section 38. These sections have not been proclaimed and relate to provisions no longer needed, and naturally the coalition will support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to part 2 of the bill, clauses 3 to 5 inclusive, which amends the Disability Services Act 1986. The coalition is very concerned about clause 4 of this part. The parliamentary secretary's second reading speech states that the amendments to part 2 were of a `minor nature'. With respect to clause 4, which amends section 14J of the principal act, the speech contains the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the amendment . . . will make it clear that the statements which the minister is permitted to make under the section, regarding funded organisations' breaches of prescribed standards under the act, will not become the subject of a defamation action nor will any person who fairly reports or summarises the statement be liable for defamation. This amendment restates the common law. The provision should save litigation costs.</PARA>
<PARA>I have been advised that statements by the minister as authorised by section 14J of the act presently enjoy qualified privilege under common law, because the statement is made in accordance with an established law. It would therefore seem unnecessary to restate the common law. This has not been deemed to be necessary at any time until now. The second reading speech gives no explanation as to why this restatement is now necessary. This is a quite unprecedented section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition wants to know whether the government wishes to claim any precedents for this clause. Our investigations have revealed none. Given that there are no precedents for this action, why does the government claim that it is now necessary in this case? What actions have been taken by the minister in the past against this clause?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, the second reading speech refers to the fact that this amendment will `save litigation costs'. Of course, if people are barred from suing, litigation costs are saved. It has made us curious as to just how much litigation has been incurred by the minister when carrying out his duties, or attempting to carry out his duties, in relation to this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, if it is not a case of what has happened in the past, is it a case of what the minister anticipates will happen in the future? Does the minister expect to deal differently with the relevant organisations in the future, or does he know something about the intentions of certain organisations towards him, and about legal action that might thus be precluded?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the second reading speech claims that an effect of this clause would be to save litigation costs. At least, it says it should save litigation costs. There is a difference between `is' and `should'. Litigation costs are saved if the action is won. Under the present law as it relates to defamation, if one is sued unsuccessfully by someone, then one can claim costs against that person. On the other hand, if the person suing is successful, then it is open to that person to apply for an order for costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not, therefore, see the justification of the argument for the need for this clause as being to save costs. Persons save costs if they are in the right. If the minister is acting properly under the act&mdash;and he is authorised to do a number of things under the act&mdash;then that should not be a problem. However, if this clause is intended to extend the ability of the minister to behave in certain ways which would otherwise lead to defamation actions, I fear that this could lead to a very substantial and serious reduction of rights that are available to Australian citizens now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer briefly to what the act presently allows. It sounds a bit technical at first, but that is only because we have to keep referring back to other clauses. In fact, eventually we come to the end of the trail of references to other clauses, and at that stage it is all pretty clear&mdash;if we have taken long enough to look up all of them. Section 14J at the moment says that if the minister has made a declaration under section 14G, the minister may make available to the public, in any way the minister thinks fit, any or all of the following information:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the eligible organisation's name and address;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the name and address of the service that is the subject of the declaration;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) the terms of the Minister's declaration under section 14G;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) details of the eligible organisation's failure to meet the applicable standards in respect of the provision of the service;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g) the actions taken in respect of the eligible organisation's failure to meet the applicable standards.</PARA>
<PARA>To make that just a little more intelligible, the heading under which this section appears in the act is `Information about Minister's declaration may be made available to the public'. Section 14G, which is referred to in section 145, appears under the heading, `Failure to meet applicable standards in the provision of service'. So it has to do with the withdrawal of funding from those organisations that are not meeting the applicable standards. Section 14G allows the minister to make a declaration stating that the eligible organisation is not meeting the applicable standards in respect of the provision of the service, and consequently is in breach of the condition of the grant. That all seems quite reasonable, and we have not objected to that in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 14G goes on, however, to say that the minister must provide a copy of the declaration to the eligible organisation concerned. Section 14H says that the minister must not make a declaration under section 14G unless a disability standards review panel has been established; that requirements of the orders have been complied with; that the minister has complied with guidelines in force under section 5 that relate to the making of such a declaration; that an eligible organisation has applied under the orders to the panel for a review; and that the minister, in making the declaration, has had regard to the recommendations made by the panel. That spells it out a little further and shows that the minister has a fair amount of latitude. Section 5, referred to in section 14H, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.(1) The Minister must formulate principles and objectives to be furthered and guidelines to be complied with in the administration of this Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, therefore, the minister has a lot of power to decide just what he wants to have happen&mdash;which is right and proper. Governments ought to have that power. However, if the minister is of a mind to withdraw someone's grant, then that organisation also has some rights, and they relate to the disability standards review panel. The minister, however, must only take regard of the recommendations of the panel. He is not bound by them. He can still go ahead and decide not to extend the grant, or renew the grant, or whatever. He may also make public certain information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, all of that seems to me to be a fair enough balancing of the government's right of policy, a minister's power to make sure that policy is being carried out, and some protection against arbitrariness&mdash;or fears of arbitrariness&mdash;by government or a minister. There is a review process, the outcome of which is public. The minister does not have to follow its recommendations therefore it is all the more mystifying why the minister now seems to need this new protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said a few minutes ago, my information is that the Minister for Health has qualified privilege under common law. I am not a lawyer but I know a little about defamation actions&mdash;I have been down that path, but not against a minister. This privilege derives from the fact that he is empowered to do certain things under the act. However, this is qualified, to the extent it should be by common law. That common law protects the rights of the litigant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some honourable members seem to think that when words uttered in this chamber appear in a speech in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, they are totally protected from any defamation action. They are not. If any one of us&mdash;or somebody else&mdash;were to take an extract from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and circulate or promulgate it maliciously, that protection would not apply. In publishing maliciously, the protection is not there. So there are limits on privilege in this place&mdash;rightly so. The protection of parliamentary privilege enables us to raise things that we need to put on the record and that otherwise may not be able to be raised. But malice is a different issue entirely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fear that we could obliterate rights, whether of people or organisations, that could lead to injustice through this proposed amendment of section 14J. Those rights are now available in the case of malice, for example, but presumably would disappear once we take away the right of action for defamation. The coalition would like the questions I posed earlier answered by the minister&mdash;and we want a good answer. I foreshadow that, if we do not get it, at the committee stages of the bill the coalition will vote against clause 4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, part 8, clauses 28 to 52, of the bill amends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. The most significant changes are, firstly, to allow the Therapeutic Goods Administration&mdash;TGA&mdash;to evaluate goods which, under the transitional provisions of the 1989 act, were listed or registered without evaluation. Secondly, it gives effect to an international convention on the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, which allows for mutual exchange of manufacturing information, thus removing the need for overseas inspections by the importing country. Thirdly, it extends the definition in the Therapeutic Goods Act of authorised persons who could be called on to assist, to include members of the Australian Federal Police. Fourthly, it claims to facilitate the introduction of complementary state and territory therapeutic goods legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this last change about which the coalition expresses a qualification here in the House of Representatives. We indicate that this matter may be pursued further when this bill is debated in the Senate. Whilst the last meeting of Commonwealth-state health ministers agreed that there was a need for complementary therapeutic goods legislation, none of the state ministers&mdash;as I understand it&mdash;was consulted by the Commonwealth government on the specific amendments now under debate. Even if one or more of the state ministers was consulted, several certainly were not. As the second reading speech states, it is necessary for complementary state and federal legislation to be introduced in support of the regulatory framework that the Commonwealth legislation establishes. Surely it would have been desirable for the draft of this proposed amendment to go to the state ministers to enable them to comment in advance whether this bill presents any difficulties which would make implementation in their respective states a problem, or even maybe to suggest a better way of going about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we will not take any action in relation to the passage of this part of the bill here in the House of Representatives, the coalition is seeking more information in relation to state ministers' views on the legislation, and reserves its right to take different action in the Senate. So far as the second bill that we are debating in this cognate debate is concerned, the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill, the coalition is not opposed to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) reflects the wide range of diverse health programs in Australia. As has been outlined by the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), it covers quite a large range of services that are very much part of Australian society and part of the kinds of health services and programs we offer. In particular, it looks at the Disability Services Act and the dispersal of assets by organisations into which the Commonwealth government has had input. It provides the ability to garnishee some of those assets to see what we can gain. It also looks at the need for organisations to meet required standards, given that this is what they are funded for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff has expressed some concerns in relation to defamation laws. My concern is that organisations which are given taxpayers' money to provide particular services for people&mdash;we as taxpayers should demand them for people in our community who are least able, those with very special needs&mdash;should provide them in the very best way possible. The public should be informed of any fall in standards. We see it as a question of accountability. We, as a community, need to be assured that our money is being spent in the best possible way. In that disability area we have seen the implementation of the Disability Discrimination Act, which has brought developments in work, accommodation, leisure and independence of people with disabilities and special needs. The kinds of services which we offer and that people are demanding should be those we are funding people for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying that, while this may be a question of law, it is also a question of community standards. While this whole question of what is under privilege is debated, it is the right of the community at large to know and be assured that their money will provide the kinds of services which they believe the community should provide for people with disabilities and that this need is met in the right way. The public has a right to information on organisations' failures to meet applicable standards in the provision of services. We have heard great detail, recently, of accountability. We have seen a whole range of issues discussed in the Senate estimates committees. It is one of the great television shows in town at times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the kinds of provisions in this legislation are an insurance for all of us; that people with special needs in our community are having them addressed, and that the money we supply as taxpayers and a community is provided in an appropriate way. We have a right to know if things are not going well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we become better informed as a community, and as people with special needs and disabilities recognise their entitlements under the Disability Discrimination Act, our more informed community will demand the services it acknowledges to be a right and part of our democratic country. As part of the health services of this country, services to people with disabilities need to be questioned constantly, looked at and extended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other areas are covered. One concerns pathology services. As many of us who have been in parliament for some time will know, there has been a great debate about the level of pathology services, the pathology reforms which happened in 1991 and the demand of the community to have access to services at a reasonable cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those reforms address the objective of cost efficiency through a planned reduction in the number of specimen collection centres through a licensing system. This amendment continues to address the number of licences; the whole question of discretion of the minister; and the question of hardship. At the core of this issue is the need for all of us as Australians to have access to pathology services at a reasonable cost. This bill implements measures that allow for the determination to grant licences in special cases. I think the community quite justifiably demands yet again an acknowledgment that pathology services are available to people in need; that they are at a reasonable cost; that we, as taxpayers, are assured that our money is being spent in the best possible way; that there is not double dipping; and that the kinds of pathology services that people need are the services to which they have access. But they are not overserviced and people should not be&mdash;to use the old word&mdash;double dipping. I see pathology services as very much a part of our daily health program. Australians have an entitlement under Medicare to access to general practitioners and to other specialist services. It is up to all of us to ensure that those services are developed and maintained at a cost efficiency level, but also that we continue to ensure that Australians generally have access to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, this bill covers the National Acoustics Laboratory, and it expands on the existing definition of `eligible persons' to include holders of a dependent treatment entitlement card. These people are departmental veterans' affairs beneficiaries. It also preserves the National Acoustics Laboratory's symbol. I think that is something of which we can justifiably be proud. Australians should be very proud of the work which the National Acoustics Laboratory does. It provides a whole range of services to people with hearing impairment, and it has been very highly praised. It has earned both national and international recognition in the way that it operates. To be able to expand this service, to define whom our beneficiaries are, and to maintain the symbol of something which is theirs is recognition yet again of the singular and very important work which they do. The nature of that work is highly prized, not just by the clients of the National Acoustics Laboratory but indeed by all Australians, because we all prize excellence. We all prize work which is done and which we seek acknowledgment for. Within the recognition and maintenance of that symbol, we see a treatment of it. There seems to be no area that is left untouched by this particular health services bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question of equity and justice lies in the area of pharmacy relocation. Some people relocated pharmacy premises before 18 December 1990, and they may not be technically entitled to the moneys for dispensing which they have been given. So this is a question of justice to ensure that people who have gone in good faith to these pharmacies and continue to be served by them are entitled to the money which has already been given. We all remember the kinds of difficulties which the pharmacy boards and the pharmaceutical associations and societies went through in terms of that whole relocation process&mdash;the lack of question of market forces, and the needs and demands of us as a community to have access to pharmacies without being extremely overserviced or pharmacists finding themselves doing everything to maintain their service rather than to dispense goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that whole area of the relocation of pharmacies and the dispersion of various pharmacies, some people relocated without getting the necessary permission. We may find that difficulties could arise. So this bill addresses that matter. Yet again, this amendment focuses on the needs of people&mdash;people who need to be able to access dispensing pharmacies as part of our health program. So we, as a government, are ensuring that those needs can and will continue to be met. There is no question of that not happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area which is covered by this bill is nursing homes. As honourable members would know, this government has been committed, through its age care policy, to an expansion of nursing homes. It has also provided that nursing homes and specifications for government nursing homes will be covered by the National Health Act of 1988. That act endeavoured to do a whole range of things but in particular in relation to nursing homes it provided us with a whole series of specifications for the way in which government moneys could be spent. This bill repeals some parts of legislation which are made redundant by that particular act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is quite important that we address those issues and ensure that the National Health Act, which deals with specifications for government nursing homes, is the prime act, and that people in nursing homes have, and continue to have, the support of the government in its whole range of services which it now offers to the aged. The whole role of nursing home proprietors and the government in the treatment of people in nursing homes and hostels has been covered by a whole range of rights and responsibilities in nursing homes. We have seen a focus of the community on people in nursing homes; demands of people in nursing homes; and a question of advocates. We see this as a client centred program. This yet again continues that kind of work which this government has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major area which this Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill covers is the Therapeutic Goods Act. As honourable members would be aware, early in 1993 the ministers for health in all states and territories reaffirmed an earlier agreement that a national uniform approach to the regulation of drugs was required. It would seem we are a very mobile country. Most people would know that 25 per cent of Australia's school children move interstate every year. So if we have a quarter of our school children moving interstate, a lot of other people are obviously moving interstate as well. A uniform system for controls of therapeutic drugs is important. We, as a national government, manage the national health program through Medicare, so it is important that therapeutic drugs are addressed in a national way. It would be seen to be necessary for this to happen. The state and territory ministers themselves have said that this is a very important proposal, and they support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other provisions that this gives effect to are Australian's obligations under the convention for mutual recognition of inspections in respect of the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. Australia takes very seriously its international conventions. I think we would all recognise that there is a need for approval of overseas manufacturing sites for the supply of raw and finished materials to Australian therapeutic goods and manufacturers. We need to be assured, as an Australian community, that the kinds of standards which we maintain here in relation to the manufacture of goods is maintained overseas. None of us wants to see those standards diminish. We believe that it is vitally important to all of us as consumers that this is maintained. So this bill enables those overseas manufacturing sites to be inspected and to facilitate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also looks at the Australian register of therapeutic goods and enables kits and other things designated as kits to be registered. There are a couple of important provisions in this bill in terms of breaches of the act in relation to the use of the Australian Federal Police. Perhaps one other important recommendation is that this bill enables the determinations of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee in its report to be made public. I think that is particularly important, because this recommendation was always intended for implementation in Professor Baume's report. This amendment enables that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us are very concerned about the way in which drugs are evaluated in Australia. We like to pride ourselves on the quality of our drugs and services. This government has had a very large education program&mdash;indeed, some of our major service organisations have been part of that&mdash;to ensure that people do not keep drugs too long and do not overuse drugs, but use drugs in the right way. It is also important that the work and findings of the Drug Evaluation Committee become public. That is in line with Professor Baume's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing more and more a need for the community to be given information, to know what is happening and to be part of its own health programs so that people can make informed decisions. As we become a more complex, sophisticated and better educated community, it is important that all information in relation to services, particularly health services, is available for us to read. I am delighted to see that those recommendations are there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all of these amendments to this act reflect the Australian health system. Only recently President Clinton has come to power in the United States of America and Mrs Hillary Clinton has gained quite some acclaim for her work in trying to develop a national health service there. It makes us Australians realise how much we take for granted the access we have through Medicare to specialist services, hospitalisation and, of course, a whole range of other services. They are very much a part of the Australian community. The community sees access to those services as a right and entitlement so it is incumbent upon the government to ensure that those services are delivered in a fair and equitable way and that they are delivered in a cost-efficient way to ensure that taxpayers' money&mdash;which is, after all, the community's money&mdash;is spent in the very best way. We are assured that the community wants the accountability procedures in some of these amendments. It is important that we endorse the kinds of amendments that are in this legislation which focus on delivery of service to clients to ensure the very best for all Australians, irrespective of who they may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, some of the people who are covered by this legislation are people with very special needs, who are covered under the Disability Discrimination Act and the Disability Services Act. There are people who have particular needs in relation to hearing. There are people who need to access both pharmaceutical drugs and therapeutic goods. There are people who are in nursing homes, and people who are seeking the services of pathologists. So there is a wide range of Australians in our community who are covered by this legislation, and they are all people who are deserving of our special consideration. They are people who do not enjoy the kinds of privileges which many of us do, and they are certainly people who do not enjoy good health and access to services in the way that we take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incumbent upon us as a government to ensure that the services to those people in our community who are in need and deserving of our attention are delivered in the most just, fair and equitable way, that they are cost-efficient and that they are the kinds of services for which we are paying. It is important that we look at this whole range of measures in a context of client delivery and also in the context of Australia's own medical services. I recommend these amendments to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak very briefly on the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). I wish to comment on a problem that has arisen continually in Kennedy. A number of the complaints have been concerned with beche-de-mer, but a number of other complaints are that the net being cast by the Therapeutic Goods Act is being thrown far wider than it needs to be thrown. Something like one in five people have severe sinus problems. They have to take regular medication and some of the capsules that they have to take are extremely expensive. I have been told by pharmacists&mdash;I do not know whether it is accurate information I am being given&mdash;that the costs of a lot of these items have been spectacularly increased because they come under the net cast by the Therapeutic Goods Act. It seems to me we could be facilitating an even wider casting of that net.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of health foods, a lot of people question the therapeutic or health value of a lot of things such as beche-de-mer, to cite an example. In this particular case it comes from a culture a lot older than ours. I bring it to the attention of the House that some of the claims made for fish over the years have been seen to be wildly exaggerated, but recent studies indicate quite clearly that the reason why countries where people do not eat meat have a very low rate of heart problems compared with those countries where people do eat meat is not the lack of meat but because of what is called the E. factor in fish oil. It is the consumption of fish that accounts for the low rate. I am not going to be presumptive and say that these things do not have the qualities that are attributed to them. But, whether they do or do not, to include fish as a therapeutic good seems to me to be casting the net exceptionally wide. These are the claims that have been made to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why this government does not enjoy the reputation of coming to grips with the problems of our country can be seen in the role of parliamentary secretaries. Today one of our parliamentary secretaries was asked to switch from being an engineering expert one minute to being an expert in therapeutic goods the next minute. Clearly no person, no matter what his skills and capacities are, can be an expert in these fields. In the state parliaments throughout Australia we have come to expect ministers to sit in the parliament. If things are happening in their portfolios that are not good, they are grilled, whether it is on legislation or appropriations. That has not occurred in this House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay a compliment, as I did earlier today, to some of the parliamentary secretaries who are being expected to switch from one moment defending positions which require certain skills, intellectual capacities and experience, to an entirely different field at another moment. The people who make the decisions are not sitting in this place and, until they do, there will still be a great gulf between what happens in this place and what are the thoughts, beliefs and aspirations of the wider Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back on to the bill specifically, I would have liked to have got this point across to the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) himself but he is not in this chamber. I request that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) bring to the attention of the minister concerned the fact that the net is being cast very wide. I do not have the skills or expertise to comment on the continual complaints being made that ordinary products&mdash;such as a fish product which has been eaten for hundreds, arguably thousands, of years&mdash;suddenly have to come under a therapeutic goods act. It seems to me to be quite ludicrous. If that is incorrect, I would like that pointed out to the House. I have my doubts as to whether we can have that done today. If that is the case, I would like to put the point very forcefully that this is very silly. It is costing people heaps of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the items that were brought to my attention have all been accepted in the United States, where there are very stringent drug controls. In that country it was considered to be quite ridiculous to have these items covered under the drug and health administration offices. Yet here these items are placed under this net and, for no good purpose whatsoever, subjected to the very stringent requirements which are very costly for those people who believe, be it a good thing or bad thing, that they need these products and want these products. That is the only point that I wish to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also make the point that parliamentary secretaries are being asked to do tasks that are really quite above and beyond the resources of any human being, even outstanding human beings such as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, who is in the chamber at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). The bill proposes amendments to several pieces of existing legislation. I will address my remarks to some of the amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986 and the Health Insurance Act 1973.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disabilities Services Act was one of the most significant and progressive pieces of social legislation passed for many years. The act was passed to replace previous legislation and to provide a new direction for the development of government programs for people with disabilities, with provisions that are more flexible and responsive to their  needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act aimed to enable people with disabilities to achieve positive outcomes such as increased independence, employment opportunities and integration in the community. The act set a new direction for the development of government programs for people with disabilities. The handicapped programs review recommended that the delivery of services be based on the principle of integration. People with disabilities were no longer to lead segregated lives. The government has pursued this agenda since 1984, aiming for a partnership with state and territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act gave the government a strong legislative authority for the disability reform strategy. Breaking with the past, the Commonwealth put the focus on rights, on participation and on achieving independence. The next step was to link this new agenda to income support. In 1988 the Social Security Review published a paper on this which recommended that income security, employment support, rehabilitation and labour market programs be coordinated as a package for people with disabilities. The result was the establishment of a disability task force and, soon after, the disability reform package which effectively offered people on income support a fast track to open employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To encourage action at the state level, the federal government began negotiations with state and territory governments in 1991. These negotiations resulted in the Commonwealth-state disability agreements. All states and territories had signed an agreement by June of this year. These agreements gave the Commonwealth the responsibility for employment services for people with disabilities and the states the responsibility for accommodation services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's agenda in the employment area has focused on setting up a network of services across the country which place people with disabilities into open employment. The strategy is very much about providing alternatives to segregated employment. At the same time, the Commonwealth has encouraged transition in the segregated model. The development of national standards this year will add further weight to the transition strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To assist the states to improve accommodation services, the Commonwealth offered quite significant financial incentives as part of the Commonwealth-state disability agreements. States and territories have also been required to enact complementary legislation to the Disability Services Act. They have all done this, which means that in Australia we effectively have national legislation in the disability area affirming the same social justice principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disability Discrimination Act which came into effect on 1 March this year added another level to the legislative reform program. A quick stroll through the past 10 years shows how we have laid the foundations for a new approach to disability services in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section 14J of the Disability Services Act, where an organisation has not met prescribed standards of service the minister may make the following information available to the public: the organisation's name and address, the name and address of the service that is the subject of the declaration, the terms of the declaration under section 14J, details of the organisation's failure to meet the applicable standards in respect of the provision of the service and the actions taken in respect of that failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that statements under section 14J might lead to some organisations seeking to bring about a defamation action against the minister. The amendment, through the insertion of an additional paragraph, states that defamation laws do not lie against reasonable public statements such as those which would be made under section 14J. A similar provision exists in the National Health Act 1953. I understand these provisions would also relate to Commonwealth public servants in the event that they are required to make similar statements as delegates to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the issue of situations where public servants are threatened with possible legal action in relation to the performance of their duties. In my previous role as a Public Sector Union delegate representing members who were officers of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, I recall a number of occasions where officers sought advice and assistance from the union relating to possible actions by community groups. This occurred on at least two occasions that I can remember in the disability services area. PSU members were concerned about suggestions of possible legal action foreshadowed by organisations which may have been the subject of an adverse report which they became aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that public servants, when properly exercising their duties, are protected against personal liability for statements made in the circumstances I have described here. While on this subject, it is not only community organisations that sometimes criticise public servants in the performance of their duty&mdash;and I refer to another matter raised with me in my former capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 6 June 1991 in this place, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) made an allegation in relation to a funded organisation in his electorate. He alleged that officers of the then Department of Community Services and Health had referred to a group of people with profound disabilities as `the residue'. The honourable member did not provide any evidence or explanation to support his allegation and did not name any of the officers he was referring to. I became aware of this allegation in my role as a union delegate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">PSU members who worked in the disability services area in New South Wales were outraged at the allegations, which they emphatically denied. I subsequently took up the matter on behalf of the union with senior departmental officials. The staff members concerned suffered considerable distress at these remarks. Although the honourable member for Mitchell did not identify any officers, it would have been readily assumed by people associated with the particular service that he was referring to one of a small number of departmental officers who dealt with that service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware from my personal contact with many of the staff in the disability services branch in New South Wales that they are people of the highest integrity and commitment to the disability services program. I am confident that such a remark as described by the honourable member for Mitchell would not have been made by any of the Commonwealth officers in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My purpose in raising these issues is simply to highlight the need for protection for individual public servants who, in carrying out their duties in policy areas which may cause conflict in the community, may become subject to attacks of a personal nature from community organisations or, indeed, from politicians. In most cases the finance directions provide protection for public servants against legal action arising from the proper performance of their duties. However, the amendments contained in this bill will provide additional protection in cases where officers are making statements under delegated authority on behalf of a minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the amendments to the Health Insurance Act in relation to pathology services. During the 1980s there was a massive increase in the use of pathology services. The advent of sophisticated new technology, the greater community awareness of pathology services and the issue of preventative medicine have contributed to this trend. Up until 1991 Medicare benefit payments for pathology services were increasing at a rate of about 14 per cent per annum. It could certainly be described as a growth industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inevitably, pathology became one of the most significant areas of potential and actual abuse of Medicare services, and this added to the major cost increases. In 1985 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts published its report No. 236 resulting from its inquiry into medical fraud and overservicing. This report dealt specifically with pathology services and went into some detail. Since that time the government has acted on many of the recommendations contained in the Public Accounts Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 the government introduced a number of measures to restructure payments of Medicare benefits for pathology services. This followed publication of the national health strategy background paper No. 6 on pathology. The 1991 reforms aimed to ensure that pathology services remained accessible to all Australians at a reasonable cost. There needs to be an appropriate balance between a patient's right of access to pathology testing and the absolute need to contain costs. In this respect the advent of new technology has facilitated some restructuring of the medical benefits schedule to reduce the schedule fees for pathology services which can now be carried out at less expense than was previously the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly the measures have been effective as the growth in Medicare benefits for pathology services, previously around 14 per cent per annum, has flattened out considerably, and there has been almost nil real growth since that time in pathology services. However, these services still represent more than 12 per cent of total Medicare benefits, or more than $630 million, in the last financial year. So there still needs to be close monitoring of these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in this bill are a continuation of the government's measures to introduce more accountability and more efficient auditing of Medicare payments in relation to pathology. In particular, section 23DK of the act currently contains provisions which require approved pathology practitioners to retain specific records for 18 months and to make these records available to the Health Insurance Commission upon request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing provisions apply specifically to approved pathology practitioners but do not apply to the APAs. Where the practitioners are employed by an approved pathology authority the terms of employment are such that the records relating to work performed under the contract of employment are legally the property of the employer and are not at the disposal of the employee. This creates a conflict of interest and makes it impractical to require the approved pathology practitioner to continue to retain these records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, the amendments to section 23DK contained in this bill place the responsibility on the approved pathology authority if the approved pathology practitioner ceases working for the authority. The authority would then retain these documents and make them available to the Health Insurance Commission officers when required. I commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

The statement by the honourable member for Kennedy that somehow parliamentary secretaries are not knowledgeable in the areas in which they have responsibility is quite mistaken. I am sure that all the parliamentary secretaries&mdash;they are an excellent team of people who have been appointed by this government&mdash;are on top of their legislative responsibilities and are very much in touch with their ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with some of the specific comments made by the honourable member for Moncrieff. Before I do that, it might be worth dealing with the matter raised by the honourable member for Kennedy, who seems to think that the Therapeutic Goods Act is too broad and too wide in its application. The problem is that people want to have it both ways. On the one hand they want to say that they have a special health product that is good for their health and has a health benefit. They want to be able to advertise that product as having a therapeutic or health claim. On the other hand they say, `We do not want the government to have any control on these claims'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They cannot have it both ways. There has to be a situation where the people making these sorts of claims about vitamins, minerals, et cetera, come under the Therapeutic Goods Act, in which case they are able to make legitimate claims that can be tested, or there has to be a situation where anybody can produce anything and claim that it has health and therapeutic consequences and we will have no controls whatever. We are not in the second exercise and it is for this reason that the Therapeutic Goods Act applies in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, we have taken the view that if nutritional supplements are of assistance to health then it is better to regulate the goods as therapeutic goods and control the claims being made about them. That is the fundamental approach that we have had. I am not sure whether the honourable member for Kennedy would want to challenge that. He made the point that there is a problem with beche-de-mer, which is a form of sea slug. I presume he means other fish oil products as well. He did not mention that we receive many complaints about extravagant and misleading claims being made on supplements of products such as fish oil and beche-de-mer. Extravagant claims are being made and it is necessary therefore to have some controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He seemed to think that because these controls are present there is some massive increase in the price. That is not true. In fact, the costs levied on such products are not excessive. Furthermore, manufacturers are eligible for reductions in evaluation fees if the goods are in the public interest. The controls are not commercially viable if a company can show that the full fees have been paid or if it can show that it is in the public interest for the fees to be waived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, annual charges for registration are not payable where the turnover of the goods is of low volume or of low value. I understand that the honourable member is a bit concerned about overregulation. The reality is that we do not have overregulation here. We would have people making extravagant claims for a whole range of nutritional supplements if we did not have some regulation under the Therapeutic Goods Act. I hope the honourable member accepts those comments in good faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff, speaking on behalf of the opposition, said that she was concerned about the amendments to section 14J and that, unless she received some sensible replies to her concerns about that section, the opposition would vote against it during the committee stage, which is its right in the democratic process. Section 14J of the Disability Services Act 1986 is only a recent provision. Although until now there has been no litigation or threatened litigation in relation to this particular provision, as the honourable member for Moncrieff said, nevertheless there are situations in which there have been legal challenges. Therefore, to ensure that such a situation does not happen in a way that would make it difficult for the operation of the act, the government has decided to insert this provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member asked what were the precedents. She said that, in her opinion, there were no precedents. The advice I have is that there are a number of precedents which provide immunity from certain types of legal action for statements made. Two examples of this are, firstly, sections 91 and 92 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982, which provides for immunity in relation to the publication of material which may be defamatory. This is very important. Secondly, section 89A of the Public Service Act 1922 provides specific protection from defamation action in relation to referee reports and work assessments. The honourable member may be interested to know that it has been argued that these reports would be protected by qualified privilege, yet specific protection has still been given by a specific provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the clause in this bill is pre-emptive because some concern has been experienced with other programs where reports relating to compliance with standards have led to threats of defamation action, and this matter has to be dealt with. The publication of comments under section 14A, which is proposed to be protected, is limited to those published in good faith. I hope the honourable member takes on board the expression `in good faith'. This is made clear by the statement in proposed subsection 14J(2)(b), where the Minister for Health is specifically included in the category of persons who will obtain protection against legal action only if the minister publishes the material in good faith. I say this because the honourable member for Moncrieff asked about malice. The proposed subsection deals with the problem of malice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the intention of the government to use this proposed subsection to protect the minister from acting in a malicious way against any individual in respect of these issues. The fact that the subsection includes the words `in good faith' deals with the problems which the honourable member raised. I hope that is a satisfactory explanation for the honourable member. I believe that the bill should be passed without amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the debate on the second reading I referred to the probability that the opposition would oppose this clause and vote against it. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous) was good enough to get some information for me during the second reading debate in an attempt to obviate that. Amongst other things, I had said that the protection that this clause gives to the minister was unprecedented and unnecessary. I said we wanted certain questions answered and explanations given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary obtained for me references to two other acts as examples of precedents: section 91 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and section 89A of the Public Service Act 1922. We have taken a quick look at those acts and are not satisfied that they are equivalent precedents. I am not learned counsel, and there are others who are better qualified to give an opinion on those examples. I will not make one up on the run, but I want to say a few words about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the speech of the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford)&mdash;she spoke immediately after me&mdash;she said that taxpayers have a right to know whether things are not `quite right'. Certainly the coalition would support that view. Taxpayers have that right now. The minister is authorised under the act&mdash;in fact, he is required under the act&mdash;to make certain information available. He is charged to see that the objectives of the act are properly carried out&mdash;in other words, that things are quite right&mdash;and, if they are not, he is empowered to remove a grant or refuse further grants. So there is no quarrel with that principle at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are taking exception, however, to this bill's proposal to blanket immunity being given to the minister. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, at present the minister enjoys a qualified privilege anyway. We have not been persuaded there is a need to go past that qualified privilege. I reiterate that the minister, if he is acting properly, is protected now. We are unmoved, unfortunately, by the parliamentary secretary's best attempts to persuade us otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary said that section 14J of the principal act could be amended by adding proposed subsection (2). He referred to the fact that there is reference there to `good faith'. I point out that there are paragraphs (a) and (b) in that proposed subsection. Paragraph (a) refers to the minister making the information available to the public. Paragraph (b) refers to a person, including the minister, publishing in good faith a copy of the information, or a fair extract from, or a fair abstract of, the information. The matter of making the information available in good faith is not covered in paragraph (a). So the coalition will pursue its intention to vote against this clause of the bill before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I briefly comment on the assertion by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous) that section 89A of the Public Service Act 1922 and section 91 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 constitute precedents for clause 4 which contains the provision to be added to section 14J of the principal act. If one looks first at the Public Service Act provision, it can be seen that this is a provision which protects a person in the preparation of a report in the course of employment where it is done in good faith. It is not a provision that relates to the publication of a report; it relates to the preparation. One might want to argue that, in that respect, it merely restates the common law. To that extent, it might be suggested validly that it constitutes a precedent, but it is not in any way relevant to a situation where, a report or statement having been prepared in the ordinary course of the work of a department, the minister then elects to make it public. It is that issue which is addressed in the proposed addition to section 14J of the principal act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at section 91 of the Freedom of Information Act, one finds that this also does not relate to the publication of a document at all, except in a very narrow sense. It provides that no action for defamation or other specified forms of action lies against the Commonwealth, an agency, a minister or an officer by reason of the authorising or giving of the access to a document pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a general publication; that is almost tantamount to a private publication because it is made to one person: an applicant. It is not, in that sense, as it is under the proposed addition to section 14J, a general publication or the making of information or a statement available to the public. I respectfully suggest that neither provision constitutes a precedent for what is sought to be done here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is concerned to take seriously the objections made by the opposition. In this situation, we are prepared to take further advice on the matter; but I do not think this is a reason for delaying the passage of the bill. The best course of action is for the matter to be further examined. There are obviously contrasting legal opinions in relation to this issue. Our advice is different. I am not suggesting that the information given by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) is incorrect; I am just saying that there is a difference in legal advice in relation to this matter. However, I will have the matter further investigated. In the meantime, the best way to proceed is for this clause to be proceeded with. If there is some reason why a change needs to be made, I will recommend to the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, that the change be looked at in the context of the bill proceeding to be dealt with in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making these comments, I am not saying that I accept all of the legal argument given by the opposition, but we need to take on board the legal arguments put and examine the matter further. If there is something in what the opposition says, then I am sure that Senator Richardson would be prepared to examine the matter. Perhaps the whole point could be taken care of. I am not sure whether the opposition would be prepared to accept the whole thing if the words `in good faith' were also added to paragraph (a) of the proposed subsection. That is a possible compromise. If not, I think all these suggestions need to be referred to further when the minister examines the issue and the Attorney-General's Department gives further advice. As I said, I will recommend to the Minister that the question be further considered in the Senate in relation to this particular clause. But at this time, it is our intention to proceed with it. </PARA>

<PARA>The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It will give effect to three changes announced in the 1993-94 budget. One change will provide relief for small business by deferring the initial payment of company income tax in respect of the 1993-94 income year. Another will exempt from income tax income derived by non-profit organisations established for the purpose of promoting the development of tourism. The third change will provide sales tax exemption for goods used in various activities of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also proposes changes to the imputation system as a result of the reduction in the company tax rate, for 1993-94 and later years of income, from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. The bill makes a number of amendments to the method of calculating and apportioning certain deductions allowable to life assurance companies. It also amends the capital gains tax provisions so that they do not apply to capital gains and losses realised on the disposal of policies of life assurance, or rights under policies of life assurance, by complying superannuation funds, complying approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also amend the provisional tax provisions of the taxation law to maintain the current uplift factor of eight per cent for the calculation of provisional tax for the 1993-94 year of income. Other changes are proposed to the petroleum mining provisions, fringe benefits tax, superannuation guarantee charge and petroleum resource rent tax.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also includes several technical amendments to the taxation law. I now turn to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Deferral of initial payment of company tax</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will give effect to the announcement in the 1993-94 budget of relief for small business by deferring the initial payment of company income tax in respect of the 1993-94 year of income. The companies affected are those with a tax liability of $1,000 or more but less than $300,000, and which pay their tax in two instalments. The due date for the initial payment will be deferred by nine weeks from the 28th day of the month following the balance date to the 28th day of the third month following the balance date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for previous deferrals in the 1990-91 and 1991-92 income years, the amendments will ensure that franking deficit tax and franking credits and debits will be determined as if there had been no deferral of the initial tax payment. The measure will defer revenue of $10 million from the 1993-94 year of income. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tourism industry exemption</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With effect from 1 July 1993, income derived by non-profit organisations established for the purpose of promoting the development of tourism will be exempt from income tax. Consistent with that change, special fringe benefits tax arrangements, which provide some organisations with a tax rebate of 48 per cent of their fringe benefits tax liability, will be extended to non-profit, non-government tourism industry organisations. This rebate will apply to relevant organisations from 1 April 1994. The amendments will have no effect on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sales tax exemption for RSPCA</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the 1993-94 budget, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) announced a change to the sales tax legislation to provide exemption for goods used in various activities of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The change will provide an exemption from sales tax on goods used by the various state, territory and national bodies that comprise the group of organisations known as the RSPCA, mainly in carrying out their inspectorial functions and the operation of animal shelters.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption will not extend to goods used mainly in their commercial activities such as boarding kennels. The amendments, which apply from 13 March 1993, will cost revenue approximately $500,000 in 1993-94 and later years. In addition there will be refunds of tax paid from 13 March 1993 to 30 June 1993. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dividend imputation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains changes to the imputation system as a result of the reduction in the company tax rate, for 1993-94 and later years of income, from 39 per cent to 33 per cent as announced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the Nation</EMPHASIS> statement. At the time of the reduction, companies may have unused imputation credits arising from tax paid at the higher rate. In order to allow companies to pass on to their shareholders the full value of any imputation credits for tax paid at the 39 per cent rate, the imputation system will now operate using dual franking accounts instead of the existing single account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly, there will be one account for tax paid at the 39 per cent rate and another for tax paid at the 33 per cent rate. The 39 per cent account will operate in respect of the following: any surplus 39 per cent credits at the time of the rate reduction; any franked dividends received that have 39 per cent credits attached to them; and any further payments of tax that may be made at the 39 per cent rate as a result of, say, amended assessments for years when that rate applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of this change, under the present single account, the value of these 39 per cent imputation credits when passed on to individual shareholders would be reduced. The dual franking accounts will operate quite separately from but in the same manner as the existing single account. They will operate from the commencement of a company's 1994-95 franking year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also contains transitional measures to prevent franked dividends paid by early balancing companies with imputation credits calculated on the basis of the 33 per cent rate from being channelled through later balancing companies which effectively pass those dividends on to individual shareholders with higher imputation credits based on the 39 per cent rate. The overall cost of the reduction of the company tax rate, with which these measures are associated, is $440 million in 1993-94, $1,830 million in 1994-95, $1,620 million in 1995-96 and $1,700 million in 1996-97. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will give effect to the measures announced in the Treasurer's press release of 31 May 1993. These measures concern amendments to certain formulas in the tax law which enable the tax payable by a life assurance company to be determined. The formulas provide for the calculation of the amount of specific deductions to be allowed to a life assurance company and the apportionment of those and other deductions against the differently taxed classes of income of a life assurance company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The formulas are based on income derived by a life assurance company. One amount of income presently included in the formulas arises as a result of a life assurance company agreeing to pay the tax liability of a superannuation fund.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a facility instituted for the ease of administration of superannuation funds. It operates by a life assurance company agreeing to include in its assessable income an amount which otherwise would be taxable income of a superannuation fund. The inclusion of these transferred amounts in the formulas has an adverse effect on the tax payable by a life assurance company. This was never intended to be the case and will now be corrected by an amendment to exclude these transferred amounts from the formulas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amounts will be included in the formula which apportion deductions to the differently taxed classes of income of a life assurance company. These other amounts represent the premiums received by a company which are treated as assessable income of the company for the purpose of calculating its allowable deductions. Because the inclusion of these other amounts increases allowable deductions they should also be taken into account in apportioning those deductions to the differently taxed classes of income. The inclusion of these premiums in the apportionment formula will provide a fairer allocation of deductions to the respective classes. The revenue impact of these measures, which will operate from 1 June 1993, cannot be quantified. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Life assurance policies and capital gains</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally capital gains realised on the disposal of assets are included in assessable income and subject to income tax. A specific exemption is provided for capital gains made on the disposal of an interest in a policy of life assurance, or rights under a policy of life assurance. However this exemption is only available where the person making the disposal is the `original beneficial owner' of the policy or rights under the policy, or a person who did not acquire the rights or interest for money or other consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will amend the capital gains tax provisions so that they do not apply to capital gains and losses realised on the disposal of policies of life assurance, or rights under policies of life assurance, by complying superannuation funds, approved deposit funds or pooled superannuation trusts, whether or not the fund or trust is the `original beneficial owner' of the policy. This amendment will ensure that the taxation treatment of capital gains from life assurance policies realised by superannuation funds and similar bodies is consistent with their general concessional taxation treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed exemption will apply to disposals of policies of life assurance taking place during or after the year of income in which 1 July 1988 occurred. It will therefore apply with effect from the income year in which the  current provisions relating to the taxation of superannuation and related business contained in part IX of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 took effect. The impact to revenue is not expected to be substantial. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Provisional tax</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes the necessary amendments to retain the current provisional uplift factor of eight per cent as announced by the Treasurer in June 1993. The uplift factor of eight per cent will be applied to the 1992-93 incomes for the purposes of calculating 1993-94 provisional tax. The amendments will have no effect on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to the petroleum mining provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill gives effect to my announcement on 4 August 1993 that the petroleum mining provisions would be amended to ensure that deductions are not available for expenditure incurred in carrying out activities overseas that do not generate assessable income in Australia. Income earned by Australian companies from carrying on a business in certain overseas locations is presently exempt from tax in Australia. However, a technical defect in the petroleum mining provisions could allow Australian petroleum mining companies to claim deductions for expenditure incurred in exploration and mining activities in these locations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was clearly never intended to be the case. It is a basic principle of tax law that deductions are not allowable for expenditure incurred for the purpose of producing exempt income. The cost to the revenue of the defect could exceed $1 billion. The government believes that it would not be appropriate to allow a small number of taxpayers to benefit from this defect at the expense of the general community. Taxpayers could not reasonably have expected to gain, given that the parliament's intention was absolutely clear. Accordingly, the amendments are to apply to expenditure incurred after 7.30 p.m., by standard time in the ACT, on 21 August 1990, the commencement time of the amendments that gave rise to the defect. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing fringe benefits tax law, an airline transport fringe benefit arises where an airline operator or travel agent provides transport to an employee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under that part of the definition of `stand-by value' which covers travel over a domestic route, `stand-by value' is calculated by reference to the `economy air fare' of either the provider of the service or Australian Airlines, depending on whether the transport provided is on a scheduled flight or not. The definition of `stand-by value' will be amended so that no particular airline will be referred to for valuation purposes. Reference to a particular airline is no longer appropriate in a deregulated airline industry. Also, where an airline has a published economy air fare which differs in value from a non-published economy air fare, only the published economy air fare will be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also amend the fringe benefits law by removing the requirement for certain employers to disclose the sources of information used in compiling their fringe benefits tax return.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 and the Superannuation Industry Supervision bill 1993 to allow approved deposit funds to accept the superannuation guarantee shortfall component.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of what can only be described as United States blackmail for the past three years, Australia&mdash;very reluctantly&mdash;has agreed to restrain exports of meat to the US to avoid the imposition of quotas under the United States meat import law, commonly known by the meat industry as the MIL. To ensure that we comply with the so-called voluntary restraint agreement, the corporation currently imposes quotas on beef, mutton and goat meats to the US. Given that our beef trade to the  US is worth in excess of $1.1 billion annually, it is very important&mdash;I commend the government for what it is trying to do&mdash;to have the meat import law eliminated as part of the Uruguay Round, or the GATT trade talks. The GATT quite often is referred to in the bush as the general agreement for talk and talk, because there has been an awful lot of that in this Uruguay Round of the GATT talks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that&mdash;it is extremely important&mdash;we can only hope that the December deadline and the current Blair House agreement will stand up to the deadlines and commitments from the countries involved in the negotiations. It is absolutely imperative&mdash;whilst we might joke about it being a general agreement on talk and talk&mdash;that there be an outcome by December this year. The talks have gone on too long, but it is much better to be continuing with dialogue than to have cut them off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cutting the talks off would have a devastating effect on our agricultural products and would certainly open up the world for a food trade war. Australia can only be the loser in any trade war because our Treasury&mdash;as we know&mdash;does not have much money at the moment. We have only to look at the budget to see that there is no money here in Australia. Our Treasury is much smaller than are those in the European community and the United States&mdash;the major players and obstacles to an outcome on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in the Uruguay arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do get an agreement by December this year, and as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) said in his second reading speech, the government will seek to have the American meat import law, MIL, linked to those talks with GATT. If it gets that law amended, in terms of the arrangements we have with America, it will certainly be good news for regional Australia and meat exporters and producers, because it will lead to a great deal more predictability in arrangements for access to these markets and it will certainly lead to investor confidence in those who wish to invest in the beef industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beef industry, in agricultural terms, is another industry which over the last 10 years has moved down the process line of adding value to the product. No longer does the beef that comes to the table or is exported from Australia rely solely on seasons to be put into a form that can be processed to its maximum value. The beef industry has largely gone down the line of producing more feedlot beef. That creates a lot more stability in the meat industry, with beef of consistent quality coming onto the market. That is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But all that costs money, and to invest in the beef industry today requires substantial capital. If people are to invest in the meat industry, particularly at any stage of the feedlot industry, they need stability and predictability in the markets. Only then will beef producers get on with the job of expanding our beef exports and our beef industry in Australia. So the GATT talks and the December deadline are extremely important to the meat industry. Whilst we live under the current arrangements there will be doubt in the minds of potential and would-be investors and in the value-adding section of the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will touch on the goat meat industry because arrangements for goat meat accessing the American market is a case of like not being considered with like. Recently in Broken Hill I was talking with the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), the local member, and Senator Brownhill. We met with people from the Desert Oak Goat Abattoir at Broken Hill. That abattoir has reformed its operations and is seeking markets overseas for its goat meat. Unfortunately, for the goat meat industry to gain access to the United States, it has to buy a quota. This quota comes out of the beef industry quota which is a general quota. The people were saying that goat meat is not like beef; it has a specific market which is quite different from that of the beef and mutton industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They complained&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;about the cost of that quota. This is one of the problems under the quota arrangements. The 45c a pound makes their products less competitive and often not worth seeking markets for, because of the way they have to buy their quota. They would like access for their goat meat to the American market with it being treated separately, not lumped in with other meats. I firmly agreed with them, as did the honourable member for Parkes, that we would then see the goat meat industry in Australia expanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to have that industry expand. Most of the goats that are being processed at the Desert Oak Abattoir are feral and come from some of the drier regions. They are virtually out of control and are causing enormous problems in these very fragile environments. While they go uncontrolled, and if they are not harvested because of market problems, they can only damage that very fragile environment. I just hope that when the department is talking to the authorities it will consider the Desert Oak Abattoir and the goat meat industry and its potential here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European Community allows imports of only 16,500 tonnes of sheepmeat, 6,032 tonnes of beef, and 2,250 tonnes of buffalo meat. However, the market is high-priced and this small amount earns $150 million per year. These strict limits to access the European market mean that the AMLC must issue quotas. In the instance of these quotas to the Europeans, these are issued without charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMLC also has the power to restrict the export of live sheep and it can allocate these quotas free, by auction, by sale by tender, or by private sale. None of these powers has yet been used. It could be that if we resumed trade with Saudi Arabia, we could well see that these powers may be used. I think eight or nine years ago the live sheep trade was an extremely important trade for Australia, and unfortunately we lost that. I think we lost it for a number of reasons. I believe that the live sheep trade was being used really in Australia as a by-product of the wool industry. In other words, the stock that we were sending to the Middle East in many instances was not what the customer wanted. In many ways we have ourselves to blame, hence the regulation that is now in place. I think it is extremely sad that we lost this market. It is now building again with very strict controls; but we must never again use the live sheep trade with the Middle East as just an avenue to get rid of our surplus sheep&mdash;in other words, the by-product of our Australian wool industry. I believe it was largely used as that for a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing the live sheep trade with the Middle East did, and it certainly did this in the mid-1980s, was to take a great deal of sheep&mdash;seven or eight million sheep per annum, if my memory serves me correctly. It was only male sheep that were allowed to be exported to the Middle East, and it took these merino sheep out of the wool factories in Australia. This was a factor in keeping production down. If we look at the time when we started to lose access to this market, we also notice that it is about the time production in Australia started to rise. Obviously there are other factors involved, but the live sheep trade and its demise certainly coincided with the increase in production in Australia. That led to overproduction, and we all know the history of that which I will not go into tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely important that when we re-establish this live sheep trade with the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia&mdash;it is extremely important that we gain access there once again&mdash;that we do it on the basis that we are suppling what the customer needs. That certainly means that we need legislation, such as we have here, which will ensure that these licenses to export to the Middle East are strictly controlled whilst we manage our way back into that market. In this area of the live sheep trade with the Middle East we do not hear a great deal from the government. I have not once heard the minister mention the live sheep trade with the Middle East. His performance on this issue in terms of gaining access to the live sheep trade with the Middle East has been one of silence. What we have to do is a great deal more in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that end, I am part of a parliamentary delegation that is going to the Middle East in November. That delegation is led by the former Minister for Land Transport, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). I am very happy to be part of that delegation. One of the things that I have requested is that whilst we are in the Middle East we touch base with the live sheep trade and the prospects for the future development of that trade and our contacts with the Middle East. I am certainly looking forward to my trip to Lebanon, Syria, Tunisia and Morocco because all those countries hold potential for us in the area of trade. In terms of the live sheep trade and how this bill impacts on the live sheep industry, it is extremely important as we rebuild those links with the Middle East that we do it on a sustainable basis and one where we are supplying what our customers want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that I would like to make concerns the introduction of new genetic material into Australia. We might say: what does genetic material have to do with the Australian Meat and Livestock (Quotas) Amendment Bill? It has a great deal to do with it. Unless we have genetic material coming into the country to improve the strains of beef or sheep, we are not going to be able to mix it with the best in the world. As genetic strains around the world improve, we have to be part of that improvement process in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on the sheepmeat area, the recent release of the texel sheep in Australia and the proposal to release fat-tailed sheep in Australia. Let me advise those who are not familiar with the texel sheep. It is a European breed of sheep which originates from the isle of Texel, just off Holland. Being someone who is familiar with the beef industry, I know that the texel sheep will do to the sheep industry in Australia what the European breeds have done for some of our more traditional beef breeds in Australia. They are an extremely robust animal. They are a larger animal than we have in Australia. I believe this new genetic material will come at a time when our lamb industry is certainly showing signs of much better prices. An investment in this new genetic material, in terms of the lamb industry, is extremely well timed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Texel sheep are much leaner and larger in their carcass. The product that they will produce is going to meet the consumer demands both on the Australian and overseas markets. The release of those texels, whilst they have been a long time coming to Australia and going through our very rigid quarantine process, will, I believe, have a dramatic impact on the lamb industry in Australia. Anyone associated with the lamb industry in Australia knows that it certainly has a good future with the infusion of this new genetic material in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other breed that I mentioned is the fat-tailed sheep. These sheep came originally from the Middle East. They are sheep that carry their store of fat in their tails, hence their name. The fat is not deposited over the carcass. These are sheep that have been brought under a government program into Western Australia. I caution the release of these sheep into the Australian flocks. I do so for very good reasons. Whilst these fat-tailed sheep are certainly very much desired in the Middle East&mdash;they do not have this fat deposited over their entire bodies, and that is one of their traits and what the customer wants and pays a great deal more for than the traditional type of sheep in the Middle East&mdash;they have a gene in them which carries kemp fibres in their fleece. For almost a century the merino wool industry in Australia has tried to remove the kemp fibres out of our Australian merinos, and it has been largely successful. To release these sheep that have the potential to mix in with our merino sheep in Australia&mdash;and they will; it does not matter how we think we could control them, they will&mdash;will reintroduce a gene that carries this kemp fibre; in other words, a very coarse hair fibre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is noted for its very fine, soft handling wool. I certainly caution the minister&mdash;I understand that ultimately it is going to be his decision as to whether these sheep are released&mdash;and advise him against allowing the release of these fat-tailed sheep into the general flocks of the nation. I believe the market for such animals&mdash;a live sheep trade or, indeed, a carcass trade with the Middle East&mdash;is a very small one when we consider the potential damage that these sheep could have on the genetic structure of our Australian merino sheep industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the fortunes of the wool industry are not good at the moment, only five or six years ago the industry produced one in every $10 of export income for Australia. So I think we have to look at the priorities in this area and I certainly urge the minister to think long and hard. If I had the responsibility, I would be very reluctant to release these fat-tail sheep from quarantine. In fact, I would not do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has just come into the House. I think these sheep may be in his electorate and I guess he has had representations about them. I hope what I have said accords with what he thinks about these animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This side of the House agrees to the Australian Meat and Livestock (Quotas) Amendment Bill. As the minister said, there are aspects of it with which the government does not agree totally, but it is working on it. That is certainly good to see. We support those efforts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the shadow minister that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) takes a great interest in the resumption of the live sheep trade to the Middle East.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to support the Australian Meat and Livestock (Quotas) Amendment Bill 1993. The bill proposes to extend the sunset clause of the Australian Meat and Livestock (Quotas) Act 1990. In that respect, it could be seen as something like a daylight saving bill&mdash;just delaying the sunset. I certainly hope that is true because we are forced to have these sorts of regulations because of laws and regulations overseas, and we would rather not be applying quotas at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minor amendment to the 1990 act has important implications for the meat and livestock industry, and it should gain the full support of the House. The 1990 act was introduced to allow the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation to set quotas for the export of meat and live sheep to countries where import restrictions applied, or were considered likely to be applied, on Australian meat and live sheep exports. Generally these restrictions were applied&mdash;and continue to be applied&mdash;by the United States, the European Community and Saudi Arabia. Because the reasons for the introduction of the original legislation continue to apply, it is appropriate that the sunset clause in the legislation be put back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States has traditionally been our largest export market for beef, currently taking about a third of our exports, and the Japanese market is now nearly as valuable. Australian exports of beef to the US in 1992 were worth $1.1 billion. The quota to the United States is allocated on the basis of the exporter's global shipments for the previous year, and there is provision by the AMLC for new entrants to be allocated a quota. Access to the US market for fresh, chilled and frozen beef and veal, mutton, goat meat and some processed beef and veal is governed by the US meat import law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MIL was enacted in 1964, with amendments made in 1979, which introduced the counter-cyclical formula, and in 1988, which implemented the Canada-United States free trade agreement. The MIL contains a formula which determines the permitted level of imports, known as the trigger level, for each calendar year. This formula allows imports to grow in line with the overall increase in beef production, but it also winds back access when there is a cyclical increase in cow beef production, the product with which most imports compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Import controls must be imposed if the Secretary of Agriculture estimates that the imports will reach the trigger level. The US prefers to negotiate voluntary restraints with supplier countries rather than impose import quotas. The gain for supplier countries, including Australia, is that quotas must be applied at a level 10 per cent below the trigger level whenever it appears that the trigger level is likely to be exceeded. Restraint agreements have applied in 17 of the years since 1965. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics completed a study for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which, in summary, concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent times the efficacy of the price stabilisation capacity of the MIL has been eroded by the sharp increase in the (Canada-US Free Trade Agreement); the recent growth in US beef exports, particularly to North Asia; and aspects of the MIL formula itself.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia is negotiating in the Uruguay Round to have the MIL replaced by tariff-only protection and more predictable access conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House should be aware that Australia reluctantly, but voluntarily, restricts the amount of beef it exports to the United States. This is done through the AMLC applying the 1990 quotas act. The voluntary restriction comes through the United States' application of the MIL. Without complying with this voluntary restriction, it would be likely that Australia would lose 10 per cent, or about $110 million worth, of exports to the US. That is why it is important legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar situation applies with the EC. Access of high quality beef to the EC is based on an allocation system derived from undertakings given at the time of the GATT Tokyo Round. Each year Australia receives a 5,000 tonne share of the so-called `Hilton' or high quality beef export quota at 20 per cent duty. In addition, we are allocated, by unilateral EC decision, a share of the so-called beef balance sheet by which a notional amount of manufacturing beef is converted to a proportionally lower amount of high quality beef with a 20 per cent levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1991 we have retained our traditional 11.3 per cent of the beef balance sheet, which has amounted to 1,032 tonnes. Last year we exported 7,544 tonnes of high quality beef to the EC, with a value of $59 million. Access of sheepmeat exports to the EC is limited by a voluntary restraint agreement. Current arrangements to 31 December 1993 are for a quota of 17,500 tonnes of mutton, lamb and goat meat, including a chilled lamb subquota of 3,500 tonnes at zero duty. Any imports above this quota would be subject to a 20 per cent levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 we exported close to 15,000 tonnes of sheepmeat to the EC, with a value of close to $56 million. Quota to the EC is allocated on the basis of the exporter's shipments to the EC in the previous year, 80 per cent, and exports to other markets, 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 also empowered the AMLC to restrict the export of live sheep, principally to Saudi Arabia. These powers have not been used because Australia voluntarily withdrew its exports of live sheep to Saudi Arabia two years ago following a series of rejections, supposedly for quarantine reasons. The government, in close consultation with the live sheep industry, is actively working towards the resumption of the live sheep trade with Saudi Arabia on a mutually satisfactory basis, taking into account appropriate animal health and welfare considerations. If and when these exports resume the AMLC may have an important role to play in determining the most appropriate levels of live sheep export to Saudi Arabia. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The powers contained in this bill are necessary to manage the re-establishment of the live sheep trade with Saudi Arabia if and when the opportunity arrives. There is a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal regarding AMLC decisions about the validity of quotas and the changes to quotas which are granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see this amendment as a necessary evil. It is designed to give the Australian meat and livestock producer the best possible export earnings by not jeopardising our export markets. We have seen over the past three years that the corporation has been successful in its aims. In a perfect world, where countries traded freely, this legislation would not be necessary but, as the French and others have demonstrated recently, it is far from a perfect trading world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would be aware that US President Bill Clinton is to report to the US Congress in mid-December on the progress of the GATT Round. Hopefully he will be able to report that it is to be successfully completed. That would reduce the need for this type of legislation because it would provide us with better access to the US and the EC, two of our most important markets. But currently the need exists for this legislation to be passed so that the AMLC can continue to apply export restrictions on our meat and livestock exports in the best interests of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, this bill allows the AMLC to operate quota mechanisms on meat and live sheep. The act will cease to be in force on 28 December 1993. It does not involve government expenditure, and there are no staffing implications for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuation of the act is necessary to enable the AMLC to manage the restrictions which are forced upon us by the US in regard to Australian beef, mutton and goat meat exports and by the EC on beef, sheepmeat and buffalo.

I note that President Clinton is starting to get the message that something like 10 or 15 per cent, maybe 20 per cent of the exports of his nation are in the agricultural arena, and that about 80 per cent are in the manufacturing arena. US governments have been ignoring any assistance to the manufacturing arena which, of course, has had to provide the money to subsidise the inefficient agricultural sectors of America and Europe. Here we are, the country that can provide those sorts of products to those countries and to their consumers at the right price, but those countries are too silly to want to take them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not that many years ago that the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), when he was a minister, got involved in trade. There were actually 1,500 copies of a brochure put out in Germany suggesting to consumers that they were getting done by these common agricultural policies and other things. I thought that was a good idea, but that it was woefully underdone. I have forgotten whether it was 1,500 or 15,000 brochures&mdash;probably 15,000&mdash;but honourable members can imagine how far 15,000 brochures would go in Berlin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue has been kept at the diplomatic level when, in fact, the whole agricultural supply issue is clearly an issue that Australia and its Cairns partners should take to the people of Berlin, to the people of major American cities and to the people of Japan, notwithstanding that the Japanese now have a much more liberal approach to beef imports. The simple story is that an Australian eats the best part of a pound of steak for a few dollars, the freight on that meat being infinitesimal. Those people overseas are being slugged by their own politicians: their living costs have grossly increased through this stupid policy of protecting farmers who are trying to run farms on 20 and 30 acres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that we said to those people, `We just want to do you and your family a favour. Meet the Smith family of Australia carving up a nice big roast of beef that they bought for $20'&mdash;it might be a little more expensive&mdash;`for which a Japanese family would pay $1,000'. Why do we not go to those people? I know of no law against it. To the credit of the government, it organised the prawn on the barbie television advertisements; we said to people, `Come and visit Australia'. But we have never taken the debate on agricultural quotas and all the foolish agricultural policies of the world to people to tell them, through media advertising and particularly television, what those quotas and policies are costing them and how silly that is. We should tell them, `Ring your own member of parliament'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funny thing about it is that we send people off in delegations to America, for instance&mdash;and I have seen it happen from both sides of politics&mdash;to complain about these things to another group of politicians. We are saying to those politicians over there, `Now listen, mate, we want you to put your political career at risk to make ours a little more comfortable'. Imagine people visiting us with the same message. We talk to the wrong people. We do not go and talk to their constituents. As politicians we all know who we listen to, and we go and talk to politicians!</PARA>

Mr Dole stood up with all of these television cameras around them and he vilified them&mdash;`Do you think I would take this message back to the good farmers of my area?', he said. He had set the delegation up for the purpose of getting publicity back in his own electorate. </PARA>

But we do not have too much to worry about because the Prime Minister did not bother. The Prime Minister was too busy telling Mr Clinton what a good bloke he was.

We need to get these things in their proper context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) told the House, the opposition recognises the need for this legislation and, therefore, supports it. But the simple fact is that we are still subject to these quotas because we have failed to change the attitudes of the major importing countries where we need to sell our product, where we are efficient. We are not efficient in manufacturing areas to the degree necessary to be competitive and generate the sorts of subsidies for our farmers that other nations have managed to do. Therefore, it is necessary that we get down to the issue of convincing the people of those countries. </PARA>

But when we add up the cost of all our different agricultural schemes, all the running backwards and forwards to GATT meetings and Cairns Group meetings around the world, it might be that an advertising campaign of that nature would work. We have proved the point in the tourist area; by using our well-known sports people and others, we have proved that Australia can get a message to the consumers of America and the consumers of other countries. </PARA>

And I think that is the way this should be done.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as of yesterday we have a new mechanism. We could actually put this bill aside, because the veterinarians of AQIS are going to do it for us. They have decided to go on strike. They believe that their jobs are more valuable than the jobs of thousands of Australian farmers. The farmers are not the bloodsuckers in the industry; they actually produce something, and farmers in many parts of Australia are currently in desperate need. Many private enterprise veterinarians out there are consequently in desperate need and would fill the jobs that are being vacated tomorrow. They would do a better job for half the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quotas are being put on our exports, anyway.

At least he announced the measures whereby he is going to try to make the industry more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will stand corrected on these figures, but my recollection is that a meat inspector is charged out at close to $70,000 a year against the industry. His take-home pay is more like $25,000. He is probably one of the people who will not get a tax cut. The simple fact is that he, with that sort of take-home pay, is charged out to the industry at close to $70,000 a year. The industry simply cannot afford it. It is another quota mechanism. People do their sums. </PARA>

I live in an area where you can grow sheepmeat; I run a farm there. Last week I told my manager to shoot the Dorset Horn lambs because I am fed up with losing money trying to breed lambs. The cost of turning them into meat is such that the net value to me is not worth the effort. Yet this is in an area where, when I was a kid, one producer alone used to send a full train load of lambs away every year. That was the means of transport in those days.

For the past 20 minutes I have been wondering what we have been debating. It is very interesting to note that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) during his speech took on the Americans, who he claimed were too stupid to want to take our beef, and the meat inspectors. I am not sure whether he took on aircraft inspectors or not. I thought it was only the government that he objected to, but it would appear that he objects to everyone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the things that have been said tonight are very interesting, but I am pleased that the opposition is supporting this bill because it represents a positive but a non-aggressive marketing tool for very valuable and increasing export goods. There is no doubt that Australia has the potential to increase productivity of red meat. We could do it to a stage where we could swamp the world markets with beef, lamb and mutton and reduce the price alarmingly&mdash;certainly to a stage where many of our producers would experience great difficulty in continuing their operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of meat prices, undersupply, oversupply and quotas, both self-imposed and externally imposed, has made the grazing and feedlotting industries a lottery and certainly without security. As a primary producer and a member of a government which represents as many rural electorates as does the National Party, it certainly gives me a great deal of pride that the bill introduced in 1990 has had the effect of bringing a great deal of security to members of the grazing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it speaks well for Australia that much of our restraint has been self-imposed. Since 1990 we have seen a levelling out of the peaks and troughs. That has been beneficial to producers. They can have a certain expectation of their prices so they can plan their operation. Similarly, the buyers of the meat we export know that Australia is a consistent producer of a quality product and that we demand a fair price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every producer&mdash;it does not matter what the product&mdash;would like to be able to sell 100 per cent of his production. Unfortunately, that is a very rare situation. The honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) said that in an ideal trading world we would be able to do that, but when we are opening up new export markets, when we are exporting to countries that have a long history of domestic production, obviously we have to treat them carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are attitudes of resistance to our produce by the domestic suppliers in countries we export to. From time to time they will lobby their governments and they will lobby them strongly enough to gain support so that quotas will be imposed to prevent access by our product into their market. The confrontationist approach that existed in the pre-1990s could hardly be described as successful and it is not one that I would recommend for our industry today. Actually, our meat export figures indicate a market that we cannot jeopardise by changing our policies. So we are grateful that the opposition is supportive of this particular bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are we retaining our traditional markets in the world such as the United States, Canada and Europe, but markets such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan are expanding.

Once again, these new markets will need to be treated with sensitivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to live sheep exports, I was interested to hear the comments of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), particularly his acceptance that this market was generally lost as a result of the way we attacked it because we thought those people would accept any sheep that we were prepared to put on a ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some grazing friends of mine that keep sheep often speak of the quality of sheep that they really did not think they would be able to sell on a local market and which they happened to get on a ship to send off to the Arabian countries.

That is because the slaughter is done in accordance with their religious principles. I believe that we should be encouraging representatives from countries that want live sheep exports to come to Australia and inspect our slaughter facilities because they are going to get a better product and we are going to get the employment. I have no doubt about that. I sincerely hope that over the next few years in negotiations for live sheep markets that suggestion is made. In that way, we are in the driving seat; we can guarantee the quality. </PARA>

Despite the imminent entry of Argentina into the world market for beef, I believe that the future augurs well for Australian beef producers. But I mention a matter that concerns me in relation to our beef industry, in particular; that is, the vertical integration by offshore investors into our beef industry. I am talking about the fact that breeding, fattening, slaughtering and export facilities are owned by the one company. This places people in the grazing industry at a tremendous disadvantage because such vertically integrated companies do not have to make a profit up to the point of export. Their profit is made from the export stage onwards, particularly if they are the selling company in their own country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not think I would ever get to the stage where I would agree with the honourable member for O'Connor, but he identified that point as well.

I can assure the House that, as long as I am a member, I will oppose the increased participation in our industry by companies such as ConAgra, the Itoman Corporation, Nippon Meat Packers and Mitsubishi, because I believe it is companies such as these that are not necessarily acting in the interest of real prices to the Australian producer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very disappointing that we have to pass this legislation extending meat quota powers to the AMLC for a further three years in relation to the United States and other markets. One would have hoped that perhaps the Uruguay Round could have been over by now and that we could be further advanced with regard to a better access system than we are required by the United States and the Europeans to have&mdash;particularly, in relation to beef, by the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does raise very sharply the double standards of the United States in its trade practices. The meat import law was passed by the United States in 1964 and it has had the nice euphemism of voluntary restraints ever since. It has not only used it for beef but also for Japanese cars from time to time. For the last three years those voluntary restraints, which reluctantly are imposed at this end to prevent more restrictive restraints at the United States end, have been in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I say the United States has a terrible double standard with regard to trade, and in particular the beef industry, I am not saying that it is worse than the European Community, but the European Community does not try to put any moral gloss on what it does. For example, at the same time as we were being forced to have these voluntary restraints on quotas, the United States took Korea and Japan to the GATT to force them to drop quotas and to tariffy&mdash;to put tariffs in place&mdash;for access for beef to those markets. That was successful and Australia has gained its competitive share of those tariffied markets. But at the same time as the United States was being holier than thou with Japan and Korea, it was adopting this beautiful double standard by continuing to impose tariffs against Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at some of the other restraints of the United States on our trade one sees that with sugar the United States is worse than the European Community. In relation to the export enhancement program for grain the United States certainly is tougher than the European Community at present because it has an October deadline by which to spend its budget. Its dairy export program is not as significant as the Europeans' because it does not have the same surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is very ironic is that for years the United States railed against Australia because we had a quota on tobacco in Australia. But in the last farm bills of the United States&mdash;I think it is even in the budget that went through earlier this year&mdash;the United States itself has now imposed a quota on tobacco. That additional protective measure is coming at a time when the United States is supposedly going full steam ahead for a more open trade regime with the Uruguay Round. One could go on to cotton and other items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to look at how the United States and, for that matter, the Europeans, adopt dumping practices. All of us follow the GATT code, but that GATT code is a very broad criterion. Both the United States and the Europeans use that criterion far more aggressively and protectively than does Australia. To a certain extent I agree with the Europeans, and particularly the Americans, that we should adopt those same policies ourselves with regard to what constitutes dumping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just give an example with regard to how both the Europeans and the Americans have a different stance on dumping from ours. I use the example of canned fruit. For years, even though a tariff had to be paid for any Australian canned fruit going into Europe, the Australian exporters in the canned fruit industry would have to go to Europe each year and negotiate a voluntary restraint agreement additional to the formal restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1972, over 20 years ago, the United States International Trade Commission, the ITC, with only one out of the three commissioners voting, not two out of three, determined that Australia was dumping canned pears in the United States. Under the United States dumping code, every five years its people have to ask people in the industry whether anybody would suffer potential material injury if canned pears could be imported from Australia. Logically, there is always somebody who puts up a hand and says, `Yes, I would, or could, materially suffer'. So it means that we have this absurd situation that for more than 20 years no Australian canned pears have been allowed into the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) and other ministers are aggressively addressing in relation to the Uruguay Round that terrible injustice with regard to US dumping procedures. I am concerned with our beef access to the United States, even if there is a successful Uruguay Round. From my information, our access could actually be worse than it is now. The United States has put up its proposal that there will still be a quota&mdash;no tariffication, but a quota. If that quota is applied on a global basis, Australia will actually be worse off. Instead of Australia having an agreed access into or quota with the United States, the seasonal nature of the beef industry in Australia&mdash;that is, from an export point of view, as my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) knows well&mdash;means its season starts well into the calendar year. Other countries, like New Zealand, whose slaughter program starts earlier in the year, would have the jump on us and therefore any change would be a retrograde step for us. But even if that is sorted out by having specific country quotas in the post-Uruguay situation&mdash;and my understanding is that it still has to be successfully negotiated&mdash;the United States will still want a 30 per cent tariff. There is only a certain price that can be obtained for hamburger beef in the United States because of the cost pressures of the white meat industry&mdash;that is, chicken and pork. Unless we have a disastrously low dollar, a 30 per cent tariff effectively means that we have no opportunity at a profitable level to increase our exports to the United States. That means that there is some hard negotiating to be carried out in the bilateral discussions in relation to the multilateral Uruguay Round if it is successful&mdash;and I certainly hope it is&mdash;to see that we gain something for our beef exports to the United States rather than lose ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EC is referred to in this bill because it imposes even more restrictive quotas. It then has, to my knowledge, a common external tariff as well as the quotas which have to be paid. That is not enough for the EC, because it brings in some nice non-tariff barriers as well such as hormones&mdash;even natural hormones. Those who read any European agricultural magazines will know that far more hormones are being used in the European Community in the beef industry than in Australia and in some other countries. The EC officials were out here recently. They are imposing higher and higher standards on abattoirs in Australia which, by a non-tariff, cynical tactic, could make it too expensive for anybody in Australia to bother to service this very limited EC market. If anybody has been to abattoirs in the European Community or, for that matter, in the United States, the good old double standards appear again. There is a difference in the standard of their abattoirs compared with what is required for our abattoirs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I want to talk about the real problems that come with a quota system and the allocations of quotas for the beef industry, while acknowledging that it is the United States that forces these quotas on us, not we on ourselves. The first problem is that quotas restrict access. We cannot increase our exports to that market. Secondly, they redistribute profit within the industry and within Australia, because those who hold the quotas get more than their fair share, in my view, of the profit&mdash;it is not distributed fairly throughout the industry as a whole. The price to producers is reduced by as much as 30 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing to talk about a quota being free with regard to its allocation; it is another thing to talk about the traded price of it when a processor needs quota, and 55c a kilogram was a very common price paid for quota into the United States a few months ago, and it still could be the case. That is up to 30 per cent of the price for our chopper cows which form a very significant part of the United States market. The performance of trading in quotas is not unique to the meat industry and, until quotas were removed in the textile industry, that was another example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next problem that this quota system creates in the industry is that it freezes the industry processing sector. It works against the future interests of the industry, it delays rationalisation of the processing industry and it goes against desirable trends that are necessary for a future processing sector that is more productive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have quite a contrast in Australia between what I call the old style dinosaur type abattoirs, large rambling single shift ones with a whole range of problems including industrial problems, and the more cost efficient, low capital, New Zealand style, or boutique style, or whatever you like to call them, high throughput abattoirs&mdash;and I happen to have one in my electorate&mdash;where the basis of their efficiency is multiple shifts and a far greater use of new technology, including hot boning. This is something that the industry should be encouraging because it provides the opportunity to dramatically reduce the cost of processing. As the honourable member for Maranoa mentioned, the cost of processing in a beef abattoir in this country is two to three times that of our competitors. That is a dramatic reduction in profitability to our producers. The final price in the export market must remain, so it is a reduced price to the producer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is typified by the fact that according to the reports&mdash;and there have been many of them, all confirming this most inefficient sector of the industry&mdash;the average abattoir in Australia works for 32 hours a week and the new style ones in New Zealand for 120 hours a week. So there is a dramatic difference in the efficient use of capital and, therefore, the efficiency of those abattoirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But under the current quota allocation system, new style abattoirs like the one in my electorate&mdash;there are one or two others around Australia and, if they were given a fair go, there would be far more&mdash;were granted only a 500-tonne quota to the United States and you cannot make a living, even with a low cost capital abattoir, on 500 tonnes. The rest has to be bought, and bought at 55c a kilogram or even higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quota allocation to the United States is controlled too much by the existing exporters, and I guess they see it as being to their benefit to keep it that way. The Cattle Council has not been assertive or aggressive enough on what it knows is the essential future for the meat processing industry in this country and a fair go for different areas of Australia. There has to be, for next year, a far better allocation of quota to some of those new entrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I want to make is that the quota system reduces competition. Two companies have the overwhelming amount of quota to the United States. It does not worry me who they are; it is the fact that there are only two. They have tremendous leverage to use that quota themselves. That also gives them the jump on the diversification to other markets that flows as part of the attempts of the AMLC to try to get our meat going to all the markets necessary and, of course, to sell quotas if they want to. It has got to the stage that in northern Queensland and right throughout northern Australia there is such a low opinion of the meat processing companies and the lack of competition that, wherever they can, they are selling those cattle live off-shore. I happened to be in Karumba not that long ago when there were cattle going out to the Philippines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Selling live cattle is not necessarily to Australia's benefit because the importing countries make sure that any value adding takes place in their country by graduated tariffs, and the cattle that go out, go out young, and are finished off and, of course, processed in the other country. But it does indicate the frustrations of cattle producers in those areas with regard to lack of competition, lack of what they consider to be a fair go, the very high cost of processing and the cost of transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the legislation, recognising that it is essential. Hopefully, matters will be wound up before the three years but there are warnings that, if the Uruguay Round is successful, we will have to do better in our negotiations, and the AMLC, the Cattle Council and the meat exporters need to have a fairer and more positive form of quota allocation for the next calendar year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my two colleagues the honourable member for Page (Mr Woods) and the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne) who have spoken before me in this debate on the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Amendment Bill. As they both indicated, this bill extends the operation of the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 for a further three years to 28 December 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation would allow the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the AMLC, to operate quota mechanisms on exports of Australian meat and live sheep where restrictions are placed by importing countries or may be imposed. The legislation was a response to a series of rejections of live sheep shipments to the Middle East in 1989-90 and augmented quota mechanisms already operating in relation to exports to the United States and the European Community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is deemed necessary to continue the operation of the quota system to manage the current restrictions imposed by the United States government on imported beef, mutton and goat meat and on our exports of beef, sheepmeat and buffalo to the European Community. Without the operation of a voluntary restraint arrangement, it is likely that Australia's access to the US market would be reduced by 10 per cent&mdash;a significant amount when one considers that our beef exports to the US are worth $1.1 billion a year. The lack of a quota mechanism would result in significant uncertainty and disruption to the industry, particularly in Queensland, which is heavily orientated to the US export market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The powers contained in the act will also be necessary to manage the re-establishment of the live sheep trade to Saudi Arabia, if and when the opportunity arises. As the honourable member for Page and other speakers have indicated, Australia has similar problems with its access to the European Community markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's beef and veal exports are worth in excess of $2 billion. After the US, the main markets are: Japan, worth approximately $938 million in exports; Korea, worth $256 million; Canada, worth $126 million; and Taiwan, worth $133 million. Australia's sheepmeat exports are valued at approximately $504 million. Protection of our market share requires continual negotiation, given the trade barriers which apply. I believe that our government is being assiduous in its negotiations on our behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite domestic pressure from Japanese producers, we anticipate that Japan will continue to honour the Australia-Japan agreement of 1988. Already, our trade has been boosted by a 50 per cent reduction in tariff. A new beef agreement with Korea was signed in July and it should significantly improve our market share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is presently in dispute with Canada following the recommendation of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, the CITT, to the Canadian government that a tariff of 25 per cent be applied to all imports of boneless beef sourced from outside the US until the end of 1995. Following strong representations from the Australian government, Canada agreed to re-examine the restriction applying past the end of 1993. The AMLC has challenged the CITT findings in the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to the operation of the US meat import law, the MIL, Australia reluctantly agreed to voluntarily restrict meat exports to 315,200 tonnes in 1993&mdash;17,000 tonnes below the 1992 limit&mdash;at a cost to the Australian industry of more than $50 million. However, this voluntary restraint avoided the activation of the trigger level which would have reduced access by 10 per cent at a cost of $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As other speakers have indicated, the MIL is a major barrier to fair trading between the US and Australia. The government is committed to working towards its elimination both through bilateral negotiations with the US Administration and through the Uruguay Round of GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consultations with cattle industry representatives in my electorate reveal trenchant opposition from producers to the MIL and consequent acceptance of the need for the continuation of the quota mechanism to provide stability and the 10 per cent increase in market share provided by the present system. The government is lobbying strenuously to have the MIL replaced as part of the Uruguay Round. To this end, Senator Peter Cook has scheduled a meeting of the Cairns Group for mid-October. This is why the focus of the meetings that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had with the US President was on developing creative solutions to international trade issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the Prime Minister's ability to demonstrate leadership on these matters will be in the long-term economic interests of this country. It was therefore interesting to note the paltry criticisms of his world trip made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in this House yesterday. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that the Prime Minister should have raised the problem of US farm subsidies, which of course he did. The fact is that raising such issues has not in the past resulted in immediate altruism from American agricultural lobbyists. It is naive to think it would. Presumably, the opposition leader would then have blamed the Prime Minister for his lack of success. Fortunately for the future prospects of this country, we have a Prime Minister who can think strategically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of new trading relationships based on our mutual interests in the Asia-Pacific region is more likely to result in an effective trading quid pro quo than bleating about a trade barrier based on US domestic self-interest. Unlike the carping criticism of the Leader of the Opposition, the consensus in reports of the American visit was that it was an outstanding success. Just as it is possible for smaller countries to carve out niche markets by utilising skill, diplomacy and strategy, Australia can carve for itself a place of influence in regional trade negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn to some issues in relation to this bill that are of some importance to my electorate. As I have said, the bill aims to provide stability in a market affected by the imposition of trade barriers by our customer countries, all of which places more pressure on producers to be as efficient as possible. Our beef producers in central Queensland are part of this effort and have been wrestling with extremely difficult drought conditions. I was therefore pleased to note the announcement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) of additional funding to Queensland for drought affected farmers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Additional funding for exceptional circumstances via the rural adjustment scheme will provide an immediate increase of $3.1 million. From the start of the pilot drought scheme in September 1992&mdash;as I am sure the honourable member for Maranoa knows only too well&mdash;until 31 August this year, 1,847 Queensland farmers have received a total of $16 million in support through the exceptional circumstances provisions. I am aware, through my discussions with primary producers, local government representatives, Queensland government officials and political representatives that we have not been able to meet all the needs. This is particularly frustrating for those individuals and groups trying to assist families on the ground. It must be remembered, however, that ultimately the rural industry sector needs to become self-sufficient and able to manage the risks inherent in the industry. That is the thrust of federal government policy&mdash;assistance. I believe that the minister has the respect and credibility of primary industry representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the beef export industry, which is the focus of this legislation, I want to mention a specific issue&mdash;it relates to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd)&mdash;in terms of efficiency in the processing end of the industry. I certainly consider his comments on the importance of the primary producers having more say in the ultimate negotiations on prices to be very important. I did not have a problem with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Smorgon Group, following its acquisition of the Angliss Group, became the second largest processor for 1992, with a capacity of over 800,000 cattle through its five abattoirs. It exports 90 per cent of its production, it has over 2,000 employers and a turnover in excess of $500 million. It is disappointing, therefore, to report that the company's industrial relations orientation would appear to be back in the dark ages where employees are not valued as an integral part of the operation of value adding. This was demonstrated in the recent industrial dispute at its Lakes Creek meatworks in Rockhampton, a dispute which spread to its Townsville abattoir. What effectively became a lockout situation will not ultimately improve productivity, nor will an attempt to bludgeon people into accepting the stripping away of award conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to report that the coalmining unions in the Bowen basin provided effective support for the meatworkers in their dispute, and there was also a great deal of effective community support. I am glad to be able to say that there has been a return to work. I hope that the company will now sit down and negotiate effective work practices and productivity issues with the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is no doubt that new technology, plant and equipment will assist this process, it will not help to bludgeon people into submission. For those people who have not worked at, or been to, a meatworks, it is a very tough end of the work force. It is not easy work; it is hard and difficult work. It is still true that workers front up for a line-up to see if they can get a few hours or a couple of days work on a casual basis. This is not easy when we are trying to bring up a family and pay our costs. It is very difficult work. It is very important to our export initiative that we have effective work practices and improve our productivity, but we will not do it with this kind of industrial relations policy. </PARA>

If we are going to develop this very important export market, we must remember that we have a number of players and stakeholders.

This legislation is but one aspect of the government's commitment to further developing our commodity exports in a highly competitive world trade environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The news is not all bad. Before I conclude, I would like to mention that we are going to have the Rockhampton brahman week. Australia's biggest bull sale is to be held between 6 and 8 October. There will be 933 bulls for sale. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might say this is an enormous amount of bull, and it is certainly true that Rockhampton is the beef capital of Australia. Rockhampton has a number of amazing statues at both ends of the town. I might mention that they often lose a particular part of their appendage, which is creating some difficulties in the city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of very difficult circumstances in the industry&mdash;including the drought&mdash;it is important to note that there has obviously been an upturn recently with the rains that we have had, and there is a new air of optimism. In fact, it was reported that the sentiment was quite bullish in the market. This augurs well for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to another initiative. There was a very particular cattle sale at the CSIRO in Rockhampton recently, and that was the first auction of boran and tuli in utero embryos, which are the product of a long project by CSIRO in collaboration with primary producers in the cattle industry. This has been a remarkable story of how science and technology can assist our export effort. Over a long period of time genetic material was brought to Australia from Africa. It was very exciting to be at the sale of these wonderful new breeds of cattle which will be particularly adapted to our Australian conditions. I believe these cattle are going to make a huge difference to our exports in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It reminds us&mdash;if we need to be reminded, and I think we do&mdash;of the importance of research and development, and allocating funds to the longer term development of new technology in this area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly support the Australian Meat and Live-Stock (Quotas) Amendment Bill which is before the parliament. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) speaking in the way that she did. As we all know, Capricornia is a very strong beef seat and it is very obvious that the honourable member has the interests of her electorate at heart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bill is to extend the power of the AMLC for a further three years so that it can establish quota schemes for the export of meat and live sheep from Australia in particular circumstances. Both the free trading United States and the protectionist EC impose import restrictions on our meat exports. Apparently, the EC thinks it is important to charge its less well off people a lot more than it needs to for food, including meat. This is based on the principle of `From him that hath not it shall be taken', because the French peasantry has many votes. I think they call this social equity in France, because socialist governments in France also endorse the policy. However, as we all know, the cost to the EC of not pursuing freer trade is absolutely immense and, if the French sabotage the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations, all Europe will suffer, particularly the French. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has now been estimated that farm subsidisation by the rich industrial countries costs between $US270 billion and $US300 billion per year, if one takes consumer transfer into account. The United States and Australia worked well together to break down some of the wall of protection surrounding the Japanese beef market through the 1980s and protection is now only a 50 per cent tariff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will never forget the statement of a US official during those negotiations. He said that if the United States and Australia could not get access to the Japanese meat market, then Australia might try even harder to break down the meat import law, and he did not have his tongue in his cheek. Because of the vagaries of the US legislative system, the counter-cyclical meat import law was attached to legislation in the mid-1960s, removing an anomaly which required the payment of a tariff on racehorses returning from overseas which were owned by United States citizens while they were out of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the type of meat we export to the United States, our product provides little, if any, threat to US producers. Recently, we had the ridiculous situation whereby Canada imposed import controls because Australian meat was allegedly flowing through Canada to meet the high demand and prices for meat in the US at a time when quotas were imposed on our meat going into the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also required to meet the export plant and inspection standards of the United States Department of Agriculture, and we are pleased to. But I think it helps to understand at times that our meat trade is a very controlled one and we have to fight for every bit of additional market we can get. Out of the goodness of its heart, we get a few tonnes of meat into the EC, within quota. It is ironic that we constantly have to deal with European business people wanting to import product from Australia who do not realise that they are prohibited by the EC's own protectionist policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides a reminder of the role that the AMLC plays in keeping the fiercely competing arms of the industry working together. If the AMLC did not perform tasks such as quota imposition, setting up systems to deal with such matters as contaminants, such as organochlorines, and dealing with questions associated with the live sheep trade and health issues, the government would have had to be more directly involved. Quite frankly, governments do not have the flexibility, and sometimes they do not have the trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Producers, saleyard operators, processors, workers, inspectors, wholesalers and retailers all interact competitively in this industry and it is very important that there be an organisation of the strength and ability of the AMLC where the key actors have some ownership. In order to unite the industry, facilitate trade and develop and promote the domestic market, it is important to have the identity of a government body to handle markets that are really government to government and to have the flexibility to meet promotional and marketing competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the work of the statutory marketing authorities in general could be handled by Austrade. But it is the nature of the producing and processing industries to require a consultative levy paying mechanism, such as that of the AMLC. Some Darwinists in the processing industry, who believe in the survival of the fattest, are seeking to all but destroy the AMLC and make it a much leaner, supposedly more commercial, body. The AMLC is very commercial. It has been so under its former chairman, Mr Dick Austen, and continues to be so under Mr Cotton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not possible for the private export industry to achieve all that the AMLC has been achieving on its own, no matter what a few greedy operators think&mdash;just because they resent paying a levy to part fund the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. All parts of the industry determined the present funding level. I do not believe that it should be destroyed on the basis of greed, ideology or perversity. If the industry wants to spend more on promotion or marketing, or less, or meet a particular demand or requirement, it can do this within its own arrangements. This gives all players within the industry the flexibility they need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it may be said that the AMLC does a bit too much for the export sector at times, this is a question only of judgment or balance. The levy paying industry, the board or the policy council are the best judges. The past decade has been one of significant growth for the Australian meat and livestock industries. The beef industry, in particular, has grown considerably over this period. Evidence of this growth can be seen in a number of industry statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Total beef and veal production has grown from 1.41 million tonnes in 1984 to 1.84 million tonnes in 1992, while the farm-gate value of production has risen from about $2.1 billion to $3.7 billion over this period. To a large degree, this growth in output has occurred as a result of advanced export opportunities, particularly in Asia. In volume terms, beef and veal exports have almost doubled over the past decade, rising from 616,000 tonnes in 1984 to 1.191 million tonnes in 1992, while the value of exports has increased from $1.1 billion in 1983-84 to almost $2.8 billion in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also of note is the strong growth in exports of high value products such as chilled and grain fed beef in recent years. For example, exports of chilled, grain fed beef to Japan have increased by over 1,300 per cent between 1988 and 1992. High value is the way to go with respect to value adding in the industry, because most people still like to buy meat raw. It is in the areas of finishing, chilling, packaging and getting dependable supplies of grains for finishing off cattle where higher value added products can be aimed for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the domestic market, beef consumption was stable at around 40 kilograms per head for much of the 1980s but it fell to about 37 kilograms per head in 1992 largely due to depressed economic conditions. In real terms, however, the value of domestic sales has been approximately stable since 1987-88. Trends in the sheepmeat industry have been less clear cut than those in the beef industry. Mutton production has been extremely high since 1990 as the result of problems with the wool industry. The industry has been successful in developing new export and domestic outlets for this increased volume of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lamb production has been trending downwards since 1984, partly as a result of stagnant to declining consumption in the major outlet for lamb&mdash;the domestic market. But, recently, prices have been picking up. Despite this decline in production, the lamb industry has managed to increase exports, especially the higher value cuts. Particularly significant has been the growth in exports of chilled lamb to North America. Recently the industry has put in place a major campaign, the trim lamb campaign, aimed at arresting the declining domestic consumption and increasing sales of lean, boneless lamb cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation has played an instrumental role in the development of the meat and livestock industries over the last decade. Since its inception in its current form in 1984, the corporation has implemented programs in three key areas: market access, market information and marketing systems, and marketing and promotion. Activities in all these areas will enable the industry to capitalise on new opportunities and to remain competitive with competing meats and foods, by changing consumer perceptions of red meat, implementing marketing systems that reduce selling costs and better matching production to consumer requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all these areas, the overriding philosophy of the corporation has been to work to improve the efficiency of operational markets rather than intervene directly in the operation of the market itself. This philosophy reflects the corporation's and, for that matter, the government's view that, with few exceptions, the normal unimpeded operation of markets will provide optimum outcomes. Consequently, the corporation has confined itself to activities that are of net benefit to the industry but which, because of their nature, would not be provided at optimal levels by the industry itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Market access is one such type of activity. I want to touch on the Andriessen assurances, which was gained in 1985. Those assurances, which effectively kept most of the Asian region free from massively subsidised EC beef, have been the foundation on which much of the growth of the Australian beef industry has been built. There is no way that I am going to downgrade in any sense the role played by government in securing the Andriessen assurances. But the truth is that the government, the AMLC and the industry worked very well in that enterprise as we did in many other areas. The then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, is to be congratulated, as are some of the key public servants of the time&mdash;Mr Duthie and Mr Teece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lead-up to the Andriessen assurances occurred at a time when the corporation was on the lookout for threats and was able to provide to government high quality analytical advice. We worked with those assurances, and we had our own advice at the time. Together, we examined the threat from the EC and the market opportunities in Asia. Of particular importance was the part the corporation played in analysing the policy mechanism that the EC used to provide export subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember that the corporation's analysis highlighted the fact that subsidies for existing and new markets could be introduced or adjusted on an arbitrary basis by relatively junior EC commission officials on the beef management committee. Through this analysis, the corporation recognised the need to institute a procedure to ensure that export subsidies to Asia could be introduced only after review by EC officials at the highest level&mdash;that is, the EC commissioners&mdash;and only after notifying the Australian government that export subsidies to these markets were to be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that the corporation, through its status as an industry organisation and its close links with the industry as well as government, was able to stress to us the commercial implications of the EC gaining access to Asian markets. Today, the corporation continues to provide a bridge between industry and government on access issues. Invariably, the optimal targeting and progression of access issues requires both a detailed knowledge of the workings of the market and an in-depth understanding of government processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation's market knowledge stems from its marketing activities and dealings with industry. Conversely, by reason of its statutory nature, which I have already touched upon, the corporation enjoys close connections with government. With the Andriessen assurances and from a knowledge of the market, the corporation was able to fully appreciate the potential for market growth in north Asia. From the knowledge of government, the corporation and industry all working together, we were able to marshall bureaucratic support, and that got us the final agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, the corporation also played an important role in alerting similar organisations in both importing and competing countries to risks of this massively subsidised EC competition. For example, the corporation worked closely with the LIPC in Japan, which is not an organisation that gave us much joy. But it provided information on the commercial implications of the entry of EC beef and, in addition, highlighted factors such as the differences in product quality and quality assurance systems between the EC and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the AMLC worked closely with the New Zealand Meat Producers Board and US agencies, such as the US Meat Exporters Federation and the US special trade representative. This coordinated industry wide approach would not have been as effective if carried out by individual exporters. It ensured that the maximum international pressure was placed on the EC to agree to the assurance. Today, where appropriate, the corporation continues to liaise closely with overseas governments, statutory organisations and industry associations. Again, I reinforce the point that government does not always have the flexibility of the statutory marketing authority and that no single individual exporter could do this sort of job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Andriessen assurances would not have been nearly as valuable were it not for the liberalisation of the Japanese and Korean beef markets, which has occurred in recent years. Again, the corporation, in working with government, played a vital part in achieving liberalisation in these countries. We agreed that the concept of tariffication is the preferred process of liberalisation. The Japanese market was the way to go, and the Australian government then convinced the United States government of the merits of this approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of detailed and analytical input on the quota arrangements to allow Australia to negotiate transitional quota arrangements&mdash;these applied for three years&mdash;stopped the slide in Australia's market share and strongly positioned the Australian industry for the tariffication of quotas in 1990. The corporation, through close consultation with industry, was able to ensure government officials were well advised of key commercial concerns, options and priorities, and developed strong industry consensus and support for negotiating objectives and strategies. Finally, corporation officers were directly involved with government officials in the negotiation of liberalisation of the Japanese beef market. I well remember when the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) and I signed that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important access achievement has been in the introduction of countervailing duties on EC beef from Canada. The corporation again played a significant part in ensuring that these countervailing duties were implemented. As well as mounting pressure on the Canadian government and industry to act, the corporation provided considerable assistance to the Canadian Cattlemen's Association in the preparation of its case. Appearing on behalf of the Australian industry, the corporation also presented a case to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, which highlighted issues such as the impact on imported and domestic beef prices of EC imports, and the flow-on consequences in other markets of the diversion of significant quantities of Australian and New Zealand product away from the Canadian market. Of course, we can make that same point about the United States with respect to the meat import law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that the corporation had three distinct advantages over other groups in presenting this case to the tribunal. First, an industry statutory body has more credibility and authority in presenting arguments to the tribunal. Secondly, the corporation was able to present a coordinated industry case which presented or reflected the views and interests of all in the industry rather than only particular sectoral views. Thirdly, having specialist trade policy skills available internally meant that the corporation was able to research this issue thoroughly and present a detailed and well-reasoned case to the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of the corporation's most important achievements in the market information and marketing systems area have been the establishment of Aus-Meat and CALM. Both are examples of marketing infrastructure which, because of their nature, the industry is unlikely to have developed itself. Aus-Meat has developed a meat and livestock language system which enables both live animals and meat to be traded on the basis of objective descriptions. This has improved the flow of information back to the producer and led to improved carcass quality and a better matching of production to end market needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Supporting the language and product description system is Aus-Meat's quality assurance programs. This is effectively an industry-run quality assurance program which has received widespread acceptance by domestic and overseas purchasers. CALM is a computer-aided livestock marketing system, and its establishment has conferred several benefits on the industry. It is still slowly being adopted by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final area of AMLC activities has been marketing and promotion. Here, the focus has been on changing consumer perception of red meat by advertising the generic qualities of meat, such as trade, nutrition and convenience and, in exports markets, the safety of meat of Australian origin. For example, the shorts cuts campaign emphasised the ease of preparation of meat while, more recently, the iron campaign has focused on meat's nutritional qualities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In exports markets, generic promotion has focused on the messages I have just imparted but has also stressed the safety of Australian meat. The guarantees on food safety made in export markets are supported by a residue testing procedure, which was originally developed following the organochlorine residue problem in the US market in 1987. Again, the corporation worked closely with industry and government to implement a residue testing and trace-back system which ensured that Australia's reputation was preserved and that no lasting damage was inflicted on the industry. This provides another example of how the corporation's activities have enhanced the image of Australian meat and therefore led to expanded market opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spent quite a bit of time talking about the corporation because this bill refers to the extension of power for the corporation. I believe that, by and large, it has built up a great body of expertise. It is an organisation that is in the hands of the industry and its players. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Areas of constant dissension in this industry include the continuing problem with respect to the meatworks and also export inspection charging. I believe there will always need to be constant attention paid to the activities of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, but enormous progress has been made and there is a limit to how far one can push it just because there is an associated cost. Some people seem to think that through constant criticism the standards can be downgraded. I reject this approach. </PARA>

Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know, I have been a member of this House for a number of years and I have faced a number of elections. But I cannot remember an election that was fought with as much deceit as the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition came up with a policy. We crossed the t's and we dotted the i's and took it to the Australian people. But the campaign that was fought against us was just unbelievable. I am sure you remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, how every scare tactic in the book was used to frighten pensioners, trade unions, housewives and the unemployed. Anyone who was at all vulnerable was under attack. Unfortunately&mdash;as the Australian people are finding out now&mdash;that attack was very successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a government in power that did not expect to be there. It has rattled together a budget that nobody wants and nobody cares for. This budget probably has one of the lowest ratings of any budget that has ever been brought before the Australian people. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been overseas for some time. While he was overseas, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said, `I do not want a bar of this. I have been left holding the baby. The Prime Minister is overseas strutting the world stage and here I am left with this mess'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we find in this budget? I would have thought the main objective of any budget at this time in Australia's history would be to try to create some jobs and try to get some people back to work. The nearly one million unemployed&mdash;many of them long term unemployed&mdash;are concerned that they do not have jobs. Of course, this is no good for the national morale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who creates jobs? The people who create the real jobs are businesses. What do the business organisations have to say about this budget? The Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Ian Spicer, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its pre-budget submissions, the business community sought reductions in government spending, reductions in the deficit and reductions in taxes on business inputs.</PARA>
<PARA>What did it get? It got rises in all of those things. That does not say much for trying to get jobs for those unfortunate people who do not have them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is saying, `You promised, Mr Prime Minister, that there would not be any tax increases, but in your One Nation statement you said something about tax cuts'. We all know that the One Nation statement was shonky from the start, but now it has fallen apart completely. Who can blame the Australian people for taking notice of some of the Prime Minister's statements? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think the incidence of tax should rise. I do not think that we ought to be having surplus fetishes years from now and try to cover them with tax collections brought about by a higher incidence of taxation. I just do not think we need . . . it. What I'm promising is not to put up tax.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will be following the policy we have been following&mdash;that is, to keep Australia a low tax country.</PARA>
<PARA>This government comes in and promises tax cuts and legislates for tax cuts&mdash;they are l-a-w&mdash;and then to pay for those tax cuts it brings in these insidious taxes. That is why the coalition is opposing those taxes. We are saying to the government, `You must provide those promised tax cuts to the people'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are we insisting on that? I had a long, hard look at it because I was very concerned. I thought that we ought to forget about these tax cuts. I have received a lot of information lately from people in my electorate&mdash;the low to middle income earners and the unemployed. I have a letter from an unemployed person, which will give honourable members an idea of what the unemployed think about the situation today. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My purpose in writing to you is to express my profound concern for the problems facing ordinary people in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members should note the words `ordinary people'. The Prime Minister says that most of us are out of touch with them. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have never taken pen to paper to a politician or newspaper in my life but I am now so concerned I feel I must.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a 56 year old married man with 4 adult children and 7 grandchildren (my wife and I celebrated 35 years of marriage on the 30/8/93). I possess good trade qualifications and references (a copy of my resume is attached for your information) and until the last years have always found it possible to obtain sound employment. Everywhere I go the word is you are too old. What rubbish. My grandfather was still putting in a good days work at 82 years. My father died very young, I despair that I may never find employment again. That I feel is a waste of my experience and ability and a loss to the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is happening to this country Mr Hicks? All the mature age people are being pushed out, the young cannot get work. There are no apprentices being taken on, in 10 to 15 years time all our skills will be lost forever and no new trades-people to take our place. What a waste.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Media reports in the last few days tell me the average wage in Australia is now $600.00 per week and the Government gives the impression that no person receives below $22000.00 P.A. Our sole income is now $260.30 per week or $13536.60 P.A. It is proposed to give low income earners a tax rebate of $150.00 per year that is taxpayers on $22000.00 P.A. On our income we won't pay tax so no rebate. We own an old car 1970 Model Kingswood in very good condition. Since the budget it will now cost an extra $70-100 per year to run.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are paying off a home through the N.S.W. Homefund which we will never own and should anything happen to either of us the house would be lost to the other, with Rent, Rates, excess water, phone, Electricity &amp; Gas, petrol etc. Some weeks we have less than $40 for food etc. I believe I and hundreds of thousands of Australians like myself are in the AVERAGE group and get nowhere near what is reported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This letter is not to whinge but to draw your attention to the plight of ordinary people. All I and most people want is a job, to work and put a bit of dignity into our lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My only son turned 25 on 24/8/93. When he was born I was working as a Plant Fitter on $50.00 per week, paying rent on a Housing Commission home had 3 girls at school and an old car and could still afford a holiday on the Coast every other year. Now my wife and I cannot afford a good night out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not have access to a copier but would be grateful if you could give copies of this letter to members of other parties to gauge their reaction. Mr Hicks I do not want charity, handouts, sympathy or benefits. I just want a job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That gives honourable members the message of what some of the unemployed people in our community are concerned about. Today, in answer to a question, the Prime Minister said that we must get used to the idea that we are going to have a great number of long-term unemployed people and that we must do all we can to look after them because he does not want an underclass in this nation. There is an underclass in this nation: the people on low incomes who are finding it so very difficult to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last several months I have had a number of phone calls, from women mainly, who have been crying on the phone. Some have come into my office to see me and said, `Mr Hicks, we can no longer survive as a family. We would be far better off if we split up and went on to the benefits and welfare provided by the government if we are to survive at all'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to give another example, a woman who had been working full time, as had her husband, until seven weeks ago came to my office recently. They have three dependent children. Her husband is still working. He earns between $350 and $385 net per week. They are in receipt of the family allowance payment of $62 a fortnight. They applied for sickness allowance but they are earning too much. They are paying off their home and are finding it impossible to survive on one salary. The only assistance they can get is the additional family payment. I have tried to get that for them, but the problem is that, as the lady said to me, she has $40 in the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another lady&mdash;I will not go into it in detail&mdash;actually brought in a list of what it costs her to live per fortnight and what she and her husband are earning. At the end of the fortnight they have got $21.50 left over. They have to keep the children and provide all the extras on that. There we have an underclass in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 10 years we seem to have got away from the situation of people just being able to live on a wage or a salary. It seems to me that most people in Australia can survive only if they are getting welfare payments in addition to wages. We have in effect over the past 10 years reduced ourselves almost to a welfare state. As an Australian, I am not very proud of that. This is one of the reasons why I am saying that we in the coalition really cannot oppose this reduction in taxation&mdash;because these people must get some tax relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past few years the government has been bragging about this accord that it has with the trade union movement. The government has also been bragging that it has been able to keep wages down. I do not think it is a matter of keeping wages down; I think we have to try to get the wages up so that people do not have to depend on welfare payments. The only way we can do that is to have a deregulated industrial relations system. But while the government side is being dictated to by the ACTU and the union movement this will never happen. The ranks of the unemployed will continue to swell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want people to have lower wages; we want people to have higher wages. We want people to have all those benefits that we should be able to provide in Australia. We cannot do that until we deregulate the system. Of course, we intended to do that in our coalition policy. I might say a bit more about that later. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) is in all sorts of strife trying to do what he knows is right for this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we opposing here? We are opposing the fuel tax increases. Let us have a look at those fuel tax increases. We have an immediate increase of 3c on leaded and unleaded petrol; in February 1994 there will be an increase of 2c on leaded petrol and 1c on unleaded petrol; and in August 1994 there will be an increase of 2c on leaded petrol and 1c on unleaded petrol. There was to be a 3c increase on leaded petrol in February 1995, but the Democrats will not allow the last 3c. That is very generous of them. We are all paying the increases now.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that increase do? When a tax is put on fuel, it is worse than any GST because it increases everything. If we were setting up this chamber today, everything in this room would increase in price because of the fuel increase. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the wine industry and at the temerity of the Treasurer. It is all right to blame everyone else, but it is really the Treasurer and the Prime Minister who get the budget together; they are the ones who work out the revenue. Who in their right mind would attack the wine industry, one of the leading industries in Australia? I would say that in technical terms we are recognised as one of the best wine producers in the world, both in quality and in cost. Previously, wine was taxed at 20 per cent. The sales tax on wine has now jumped to 31 per cent, with a further rise to 32 per cent in July 1995. It is estimated that such an increase will mean that a $5 bottle of wine is likely to rise in price by $1, a $10 bottle by $2, a $20 bottle by $3 and an $8 four-litre cask could cost $10. The industry is expecting consumption to fall by 10 per cent or possibly more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could go on and on with the figures, but the thing that really concerns me is not only the effect it will have on the wine industry and the wineries but also on the wine grape growers in my electorate and in other electorates. Already suffering now, they will be suffering further because of these fuel imposts and other taxes and charges imposed on them. The wine industry is one of the few industries that is really showing the way and putting Australia on the map, and the government has come along and chopped it off at the knees.

The industry survived, not because of the government but despite the government, and now we find this new tax on wine. It is horrendous.

There is a $608 million decrease in road funding, with further decreases next year. Australia just cannot face that. The federal government recently announced that the Newell and Sturt highways will be part of the national highway system. With a reduction of $608 million in road funding I do not know how it will do that. The road system in much of my electorate is already dangerous.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is now some six week since the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) handed down this year's budget. Therefore, it is perhaps appropriate to reflect not only on the budget but also on the events that have occurred since. There has been a wide range of criticism of the 1993-94 budget. I have to admit that I share some of those concerns. Pleasingly, some of them have already been addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to speak primarily about two matters: the budget process and the issue of unemployment. In the period since the Treasurer delivered the budget, we have seen what is surely an unprecedented process of negotiation and division. Most of this has occurred as a result of the objections to aspects of the budget by people outside of the executive: from the caucus, the ACTU, the minor parties in the Senate and sections of the wider community. There has been criticism of this input, criticism of the role of the caucus and the ACTU, and a suggestion that this display of disunity has produced the government's dip in recent opinion polls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject this criticism, because I was pleased to see the budget amended in the ways that it has been and because I believe that this input has been appropriate. For example, I believe the ACTU has every right to have a say about the nation's budget. The question is not whether it should have a say but at what stage it has that say. Unfortunately, this year, for the first time in a decade, the ACTU was not consulted during the formulation of the budget. If it is not given an opportunity to have a say beforehand, then it can hardly be criticised for having a say afterwards. It is not, as the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) has just indicated, a matter of the ACTU dictating to government; it is the ACTU, on behalf of its membership, having input along with other representative bodies that represent different sectors of the community. It is on a basis of policy making that involves a spirit of inclusion of the wider community in the decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must recapture the spirit in which the One Nation statement and last year's budget were developed. This was a process based on consultation. In my view, the reason that One Nation and last year's budget were so well received and seemed to be effective was that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Treasurer and other ministers were out and about in the community listening to the key players&mdash;to the unions, to the business sector and to other community organisations. What has been seen in the last few weeks is the necessary, indeed inevitable, consultation and finetuning that should and could have taken place before budget night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the decision regarding the removal of Medicare rebates for optometrical consultations for those other than health care card holders. This was a stupid decision. I was horrified to be informed that, in a fashion, it was borrowed from the textbook of Margaret Thatcher. Mrs Thatcher removed eye care from the National Health Service in 1985, but even she had the good sense to exempt children under the age of 16 and families in receipt of supplementary benefit, the family income supplement or on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through this initiative, the British government saved a paltry #17 million in 1985. The measure that was originally included in the budget was also intended to save a paltry amount. However, I would not want the opposition to take comfort from my comments on this issue; indeed, it cannot. It went to the last election with a plan to smash Medicare and were rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community reaction to the proposal to delete eye tests underscores the community support for Medicare. The community wants Medicare; they want its universality protected and they are prepared to challenge anyone who threatens this. In fact, I believe that we should be mature enough to be looking not only at the present coverage under Medicare of medicine and optometry, but also at other allied health professions that might be included under the umbrella. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the dropping of the eye test rebate would never have been considered seriously had it been widely canvassed. The whole consultative process of decision making can be used to refine ideas and to prevent bad decisions being taken. I would now hope that the importance of getting this process right has been realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last election was not about the level of taxation; it was about the nature of taxation. The electorate rejected unfair regressive taxes such as the GST. Perhaps in the run-up to the budget, had the government entered into a wider form of consultation, it would have understood that there was a wide opinion abroad that indicated a willingness to forgo the One Nation personal tax cuts rather than accept indirect taxes. Whilst I understand that the tax cuts to middle income earners are designed to be stimulatory, I reject any shift from progressive to regressive taxation. Whilst I also understand that there are constraints on the ability for wide consultation on specific tax measures, the generalities should be explored and discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the progressive features of the present wholesale sales tax is the classification of goods. Whilst this is an imprecise tool, at least it is an element that exists in the present scheme. For instance, we have a higher rate of taxation on so-called and so-classified luxury items. But in the changes that we see there is a one per cent increase on the 10 per cent rate, which is far higher proportionately than a one per cent increase on the 30 per cent rate. The relativities which the differing rates of wholesale sales tax provide have not been protected by this flat rate of increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share the concerns of organisations such as the Australian Council of Social Service about indirect regressive taxation. Before the budget ACOSS put to the government a number of taxation proposals, such as an inheritance tax, restriction of capital gains tax exemptions, negative gearing and taxing of luxury services. Many of these suggestions were also issues that were specifically raised in the FitzGerald report on national savings. Many of these proposals would have raised substantial revenue whilst taking into account the equity concerns that are so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, media coverage of the problems of the budget have tended to take attention away from the main question&mdash;that is, the question of growth in employment. As has been pointed out by a number of speakers in this debate, this budget has failed in a way to address the question of structural unemployment. The budget should be part of an ongoing countercyclical strategy to tackle unemployment through growth. However, as the Prime Minister himself said in question time today, the days when growth alone would solve unemployment problems are well and truly gone. Recent research shows that we need to sustain an annual growth rate of something like 6 1/2 per cent in order to return to full employment. A growth rate of roughly 3 1/2 per cent will allow us to stand still. This is obviously a chilling assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the weekend, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission launched a document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A moral accord with people who are long-term unemployed</EMPHASIS>. This is a worthwhile document for people who have an interest in trying to solve Australia's major problem of the time, unemployment, to peruse. In the background to the present situation, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission points out that in 1990 long-term unemployment was 44 per cent above 1982 levels, despite strong annual job growth for which this government was responsible between 1984 and 1990. The shift of the mass employment base, manufacturing offshore, rapid and ongoing advances in technology and increasing productivity and efficiency all add up to an employment disaster for a whole generation. The jobs that have been lost are gone forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jobs that are created do not tend to go to the most disadvantaged job seekers. In earlier contributions to this budget debate it has been pointed out that of the 1.6 million jobs created between 1983 and 1990, only 70,000 went to long-term unemployed people. The skills of those displaced in the labour market through the economic adjustment of the 1980s are no longer suitable for the new jobs that are created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its publication, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission refers to an occurrence known as job mismatch. This is a phenomenon where vacancies cannot be filled, although there are large numbers of unemployed people willing and able to work, because of the loss of everyday work skills or the inappropriateness of their work skills to the jobs available. As the document said, structural change has also created a `sectoral mismatch' and the existing skills of many people who are unemployed are no longer appropriate for the positions that become available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without intervention by the government, this situation will become increasingly worse. People who have been put out of the labour market for a long period of time require assistance by the government to enable them to re-enter. The Catholic Social Welfare Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without positive intervention, and even with modest economic growth, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">the worst case scenario suggests more than 500,000 long-term unemployed by the end of 1994, and the best about 360,000</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA>I find it difficult to comprehend how any organisation could argue for a reduced role for government when the facts are so compelling. In my electorate, as in other members' electorates&mdash;I acknowledge the cases that the honourable member for Riverina put before us in his contribution&mdash;there are many who genuinely fear they will never work again. We must all give these people hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition argues for a reduction in the deficit at the same time as providing tax cuts and introducing no new taxes. In between all of the crocodile tears for the poor, let there be no doubt that this is its policy. The Australian people need to know that this adds up to large spending cuts&mdash;in fact, massive cuts in outlays. These cuts would affect every area of government expenditure and every facet of life in Australia. The effect of massive cuts in social programs would be that many Australians would simply fall through the safety net. The cuts to government expenditure would mean that the unemployed would miss the springboard to employment that can be created through the active role of the public sector in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies of the opposition, even without the GST, remain a pernicious threat to the fabric of Australian society. We saw that from the opposition's wholehearted endorsement last week of the Industry Commission's draft report&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Impediments to regional industry adjustment</EMPHASIS>. This report has been slammed by a wide range of community organisations and economic commentators as being totally out of touch with reality. Few of the issues raised by the Industry Commission report dealt specifically with regional unemployment. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) earlier this week in question time said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . some of the recommendations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of the Industry Commission&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are guided by a philosophy that is alien to this side of the House and certainly will not guide our responses to those issues.</PARA>
<PARA>I was pleased to see the minister, and a cabinet minister at that, was willing to put that type of comment on record because there is grave concern about the type of advice that comes out of some of the Industry Commission's reports. When one looks at the terms of reference of the particular inquiry those comments were made about, one notes that in giving the reference the government specifies that the commission is to have regard to the established economic, social and environmental objectives of governments. I hope that in undertaking its inquires the commission will perhaps have a greater regard to that because historically its record has not been good. In reports on the provision of public housing, disability aids and the like, the commission's interpretation of what is within the bounds of social objectives of government is quite amiss. I believe that it should address those issues within the parameters that most people who work within social policy would find plausible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission has propagated its hardline economic rationalism. It is now common to hear talk of award flexibility as if it were some magic cure to the nation's problem. The question that should be asked is just what exactly this term means? How flexible are these awards if the terms refer specifically to lower award conditions, as it invariably does? Terms such as `award flexibility' should be treated with extreme caution because they usually require one party to be flexible rather than the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Tim Colebatch, the economic editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, outlines in his article of 21 September about the Industry Commission's report, the experience in other countries of removing awards has not solved the problems of regional unemployment; the removal of awards can be said to have further exacerbated it. Colebatch points out that areas of New Zealand with high unemployment in 1991, such as the Bay of Plenty, have even higher unemployment since the removal of awards. He gives the example of the United States, where there is not only enterprise bargaining but also `weak unions and a six-month limit to unemployment benefits&mdash;just what the commission wants'. Colebatch states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1983, when unemployment in the US peaked, the four states with the highest unemployment rates were West Virginia, Michigan, Alabama and Mississippi. Eight years later, the four states with the highest unemployment rates were West Virginia, Michigan, Massachusetts and Mississippi.</PARA>
<PARA>As Colebatch says, `It didn't work there either'. Clearly this attack on award wages from the Industry Commission will do nothing for unemployment; world experience indicates that. But what if we look at other definitions of award flexibility and perhaps turn to the question of the developing nature of work? I refer honourable members again to the Catholic Social Welfare Commission's report where it describes the move towards part-time work. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the last decade there has been a marked decline in the number of full-time jobs. This decline has also seen an increase in the amount of part-time work available in the labour market . . . In the future, it is more likely that people will have several part-time jobs. Some people may only find employment through one part-time job and require a supplemented income.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increased demand for part-time work means that there is a need to develop more flexible workplace practices so that people can job-share or move in and out of the labour market without penalty.</PARA>
<PARA>If we are talking about that type of flexibility, we really have to consider the wider issues that are involved. Why should the Australian people accept simplistic recommendations from the Industry Commission which are based on a narrow ideological view of the world? As Bishop Michael Challen, the executive director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, said last week at the launch of the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Understanding Social Justice</EMPHASIS>, written by the honourable member for Calwell, (Dr Theophanous):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new right agenda . . . does not achieve it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, social justice&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as it is based on the premise that inequality is a precondition for growth. While the social democratic tradition has most chance of achieving it, full employment is a critical precondition of this.</PARA>
<PARA>Later, Bishop Challen made this remark:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If governments are serious about social justice they must take action in two key areas, employment and taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>That remark is important in the context of my next point. New approaches and new strategies must be considered if we are to address the problem of structural unemployment. The government's white paper process provides the opportunity to do so. There has been wide discussion of the potential for an employment levy on higher income earners as a means of raising revenue directly for measures to fight unemployment. Perhaps at some later stage I will be able to develop those ideas in more detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that this white paper process provides an opportunity for consultation and for inclusive decision making&mdash;unfortunately, the types of things that were sadly lacking in the preparation of the original budget. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this evening 50 years ago&mdash;29 September 1943&mdash;the then Prime Minister of Australia, at a little after 8.30 p.m, rose in this place and said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We who have sat in this chamber tonight have participated in one of the historic episodes of our Commonwealth Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>The episode to which Mr Curtin referred was, of course, the maiden speech of Dame Enid Lyons, the first woman to be elected to the House of Representatives. The historical importance of that occasion was not lost on Dame Enid, whose husband, Joseph, had been Prime Minister of Australia from 1932 until his death in 1939. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be strange indeed were I not tonight deeply conscious of the fact, if not a little awed by the knowledge, that on my shoulders rests a great weight of responsibility; because this is the first occasion upon which a woman has addressed this House.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, two women were returned to parliament at the general election in 1943: Enid Lyons as the member for Darwin, an electorate in Tasmania; and Dorothy Tangney as a Labor senator for Western Australia. Both women were aware of the task ahead of them. Dame Enid said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe, very sincerely, that any woman entering the public arena must be prepared to work as men work; she must justify herself not as a woman, but as a citizen; she must attack the same problems, and be prepared to shoulder the same burdens.</PARA>
<PARA>This was a sentiment shared by Dorothy Tangney, who had remarked in her maiden speech to parliament five days earlier:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not as a woman that I have been elected to this chamber. It is as a citizen of the Commonwealth; and I take my place here with the full privileges and rights of all honourable senators, and, what is still more important with the full responsibilities which such a high office entails.</PARA>
<PARA>Enid Lyons and Dorothy Tangney were two remarkable women. They were not the first women members of parliament in Australia&mdash;that honour rests with Edith Cowan, who was elected to the Western Australian parliament in 1921&mdash;but they contributed greatly to the life of this nation: Dame Enid as the member for Darwin from her election in 1943 until 1951, including her appointment to the federal cabinet in 1949, and Dame Dorothy, as she was to become, as a senator for Western Australia for 25 years until 1968. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of their comments remain as valid today as they were in 1943. Both were concerned about social justice in the midst of war and within a decade of the Great Depression. Dorothy Tangney said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Preference to any section of the community implies a return to the old order of things, in which there was not sufficient for everybody, and only some people were privileged to work. If these conditions were allowed to return, they will be a negation of what we are fighting for. Under this new order there must be justice for all and not reference to any one section.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a pity that the Labor government does not heed these words today. Dame Enid said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that I shall never forget that everything that takes place in this chamber goes out somewhere to strike a human heart, to influence the life of some fellow being . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Whether that purpose in life is expressed in religious terms, as Dame Enid expressed it then, or in a humane concern for the dignity and well-being of our fellow human beings, her words echo a vision absent from much of national life today. Despite&mdash;some might say because of&mdash;the deprivations of the Great Depression and the Second World War, we then had governments which inspired Australians in unity and in hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to note that the Senate has marked this occasion with the publication of the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trust the Women</EMPHASIS>, which details the contributions to national life of 59 women who have served as senators and members since 1943, and with an occasional lecture delivered under the auspices of the Senate last week by my colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan).

In particular, I mention the work of Catherine Helen Spence, who was a resident in what is now my electorate. Catherine Spence was Australia's first female political candidate. Despite being regarded as one of the great Australian women of the 19th century, she came 22nd out of a field of 23. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 21 elections since the election of Dame Enid Lyons, 10 elections have not returned one woman; only one of those elections, the 1972 election of the Whitlam Labor government, did not return any woman for either house. Recent progress has been more steady. Since 1980 the number of women elected to this house has been three, six, eight, nine, 10 and now 13. At the rate of an increase of 10 every 10 years, we would reach gender balance well after the centenary of Dame Enid's election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me assure the House that we women are here for the long haul. It took 100 years from Mary Wollstonecraft's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rights of Women</EMPHASIS> until women won the right to vote and stand for parliament. It took another 50 years before the first women were elected to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of the next 50 years? What is the most important goal for the next 50 years? Should we aim for a female Prime Minister, a majority of members in the Senate or majorities in both Houses? I would suggest a more subtle goal: that women's contributions to the political life of this nation will be accepted on their merits and not be devalued as women's views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a speech last Monday, the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) outlined her frustration at the impact of preconceptions on her parliamentary contribution. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appeared that women MPs could state their views however they liked&mdash;tactfully or aggressively, sweetly or stridently, obliquely or bluntly&mdash;but if they were expressing views about women, too often a majority of the men in their parliamentary audience automatically closed their ears, believing that they were about to hear fringe feminist rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA>Women do not seek to have women in parliament as a feminist goal in and of itself. Women care about their community and how it is governed, and are entitled to have their views on the breadth of their concerns respected and listened to. Dame Enid's maiden speech is a case in point. She spoke only briefly about women in parliament and then ranged across a number of topics&mdash;social services, population, decentralisation, family policy, the war, housing, employment policy and international relations. I conclude by encouraging women to take up the challenge of the future. The problems besetting our nation are great; we need the best people to resolve them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much has been said in recent weeks about petrol pricing. In its usual destructive role, the opposition&mdash;the Uriah Heep of politics&mdash;has taken the opportunity to spread doom and gloom. I want to look at a real situation, namely, the unique opportunity that exists in Australia for alternative fuels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I want to talk about LP gas. LP gas is a naturally occurring gaseous hydrocarbon that exists in Australia in great quantities. It does not need a lead additive. In fact, the lubricant used in it is propylene, another hydrocarbon, so that it burns completely to produce carbon dioxide and water vapour. The cost of converting a pre-1985 six-cylinder car to run on LP gas is approximately $1,650; a new Holden or Falcon, about $1,900. Opposition members will probably say, `More money, another slug', but we should be considering the benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">LP gas is a low polluter. LP gas deposits are largely owned by Australian companies. LP gas tanks are safer than petrol tanks in cars. LP gas is tax free and has been guaranteed to remain so for the next five years. In fact, any decision to introduce tax at the end of that period needs to have been notified 12 months in advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Motorists also enjoy many benefits. The fuel is cleaner with less harmful by-products, which means that motors will cost less to maintain and their life is extended. Motorists travelling 30,000 kilometres per year will more than recoup the cost of conversion over a two-year period. In other words, the further they travel, the greater the saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent a rural electorate and I am pleased to advise the House that specialist gas converters are working overtime to convert cars to LP gas. There is an obvious bonus there for rural residents and I would urge them all to use it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I want to talk about ethanol. Honourable members may have noticed that the ACTION buses in Canberra are currently boldly advertising that they are trialing diesohol, an 85 per cent diesel and 15 per cent ethanol mix, the brainchild of one of my constituents, Dr Russell Reeves. Dr Reeves and his partners hold the worldwide patent for the catalyst that allows the production of diesohol. That represents Australian technology, under the leadership of this government to the fore again. Honourable members would be very interested to know that the public transport system in Sweden now runs on diesohol, cutting costs, reducing pollution and using our technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has recently approved a $50,000 feasibility study that is currently being carried out in the Dungog-Gloucester area. It will look into the feasibility of producing ethanol from forest waste. At the conclusion of this study a trial plant will be constructed at the chosen site to produce ethanol from renewable resources. This plant will be constructed courtesy of a $2 million grant that was announced last December by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths). This is exciting news in many ways. Ethanol will reduce our dependence on imported diesel fuel but it will, more importantly, place Australia as a leader in the world of renewable fuel technology. I urge all honourable members to watch the development of this industry that has had strong government support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the debate this week on superannuation I developed the argument that there is no fairness or justice in superannuation as it is being presented to the Australian workers by the current government. Since that debate, it has come to my attention that a number of businesses in my electorate have workers who are seriously disadvantaged. They are casual, part-time workers; some are migrants and some are women. They are people who are trying to keep the household together, often when the principal income earner has become redundant or unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, at the Hills District Evening College there are a number of casual teachers. Teacher No. 1 earned $450 for only one calendar month last financial year and became eligible for a superannuation payout&mdash;calculated at three per cent of $450&mdash;of $13.50. Most superannuation funds have an administrative charge of at least $52 per annum and the union funds are higher than that. The payment of $13.50 was deducted from $52, leaving a debit balance of $38.50. That will be carried against that teacher's name indefinitely if that teacher should go back to employment at any of the evening colleges. The funds would then pick up that debit and further write off any money paid in by the employer against the remaining charge of $38.50. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second example is teacher No. 33 who became eligible for a superannuation payout of three per cent of $1,790, which is $51.33. Thus for the first year, there was a credit of $51.33 with a fund charge of $52, leaving a debit balance in this instance for this individual of 79c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Teacher No. 49 became eligible for a superannuation benefit of $113.14. Thus, for year one, the fund statement would show a payment of $113.14, a charge of $52, leaving a credit balance of $61.14. That is the benefit that worker would have at the end of the period. If that person were not to work for the following two years, there would be a continuing $52 a year charge against their contribution, reducing their contribution, which was originally $113.14, to a debt of $42.86 at the end of a three-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no justice or fairness in this process. Another business that has brought to my attention the situation of its employees is Elf Mushrooms Pty Ltd. I will not use the names of the employees, but I have them here. The premium paid by employee No. 1 was $132.17. There is an administrative charge of $58.27, a tax of 15 per cent on contribution of $13.19 and a dividend paid of $6.82, leaving the employee with $67.53 at the end of the period. Instead of $132, this person had only $67 in the account. There is no fairness or justice in that. There are no changes in the legislation to rectify that. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Mrs Crosio), who is at the table, may be unaware of these processes, but workers are being seriously damaged by the accord of Martin Ferguson and the government which says that superannuation is good for everybody. That is bunkum and rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employee No. 2 in the same organisation contributed a total of $264.86. At the end of the period all those two people have in their accounts is $170-odd. Roughly half of the funds are lost either through a mystery charge or through tax paid to the government. The problem with these schemes is that the workers who need them most miss out. They are on a treadmill and they do not get anywhere. The funds do not get enough to cover their costs. The employer pays extra and the worker gets nothing. It is a crazy system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers are milked of their funds for no benefit and they just lay off employees rather than continue to lose money in this process. The funds are pushed and pulled by continuing changes in government policy, which means that the workers never know where they stand. I can tell them that this government does not care, because it has done nothing to lift the basic charge from $450 to at least $600. An exemption level of $600 is an absolute minimum. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, 29 September, is World Maritime Day. As such, it is an appropriate day to consider the role of shipping and to pay tribute to the seafarers of the world. Seafaring has a long and distinguished history and we in Australia, as an island continent, are more dependent than most on ships to bring produce to, and take produce from, this country. It is also an appropriate time to consider human and financial tragedies that can result from unsafe practices in regard to shipping and the potential for any vessel to cause major damage to a nation's maritime environment, ecosystems and trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loss of ships and lives in recent times has been appalling. Between 1988 and 1991 some 47 loaded merchant vessels were lost worldwide, along with the lives of at least 380 crew. Australia was not immune from the impact of the effects of this unnecessary waste of life and property. Over a similar period, six bulk carriers were lost in the Indian Ocean, having sailed from Australian ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, in Newcastle, all sectors of the shipping industry in Australia gathered to discuss the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>. Also, last week a shameful document was released from the Industry Commission purporting to outline impediments to regional industry adjustment in Australia. One of the recommendations was for the termination of the policy of cabotage for coastal shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when the world's ocean transport industry faces an unprecedented crisis, the international fleet has become critically over-aged and suffers from a deteriorating safety record, the implications for the removal of cabotage to Australia would be devastating. What far-ranging and far-sighted preparations have been made in Australia against the day when there is a shortage in world shipping&mdash;bearing in mind that any such shortage would impact on Australia much more than most other countries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very little has been done in Australia and, indeed, those opposite continue to push for our Australian coast to be opened to the ageing rust buckets of the world. The argument of those opposite is that if other countries are foolish enough to use taxpayer funds to subsidise shipping and shipowners and crews are prepared to run huge risks in running cheap, untaxed, unsafe ships, then Australia should participate in this free lunch and not bother about developing its own shipping capability, as the free market will take care of it for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not good enough for a nation with the fifth largest transportation task in the world. The removal of cabotage would lead to the immediate disappearance of the Australian flag fleet and its input to the economy. The fleet would have to flag out to tax havens to survive. Australian ships pay tax, their crews pay tax, and they carry the costs of complying fully with all the international safety conventions. We are thus uncompetitive with the untaxed, unregulated and unsafe ships that the removal of cabotage would allow in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia now has one of the most modern merchant fleets, if not the best, and one of the best trained seafaring work forces in the world. For this we can largely thank a tripartite 10-year effort between government, industry and unions. Reform of Australian shipping has been one of the major achievements of the government's microeconomic reform process. It has resulted in a major reform of this traditionally difficult industry which has gone almost totally unremarked by either the press or the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the calling for the introduction of foreign flag ships to Australia, the Industry Commission is following in the footsteps of the American shipowners in 1917 and of every tax avoiding, regulation evading international shipowner since. Disguise it how they may&mdash;they are advocating tax avoidance. The huge advantage these owners have over Australian shipowners is that they pay little or no tax. They are not smarter or better. They just do not have the tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign flags are cheaper because they do not pay tax, but that is no reason to import them into our domestic economy. The argument that this would lead to a competitive balance between Australian flag ships and foreign flags is nonsense. The Australian ships would flag out immediately in order to gain the tax advantages of their competitors and we would finish up with no Australian fleet at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is what the opposition is proposing, it is proposing that we in Australia exchange safe, well maintained and well manned ships for the foreign ships. Additionally, it would put several thousand seafarers onto the dole and significantly increase our balance of payments problem by the profits and wages repatriated out of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must strongly reject this nonsense report from the Industry Commission. On this World Maritime Day we must commit ourselves to maintaining cabotage around the Australian coast. We should also pay tribute to those seafarers who go down to the sea in ships.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this week I made a speech commemorating the 50th anniversary of the first woman to enter the House of Representatives and the Senate. I referred to the fact that, on my election to the House of Representatives, some of my male colleagues&mdash;well intentioned, I am sure&mdash;told me that I was not to be like the Labor women in this House, who only ever talked about women. I went on in my speech to point out that that was not my experience of the speeches of the Labor women and, subsequently, I had drawn some conclusions about that matter. Tonight all that the Liberal women are talking about is women, in contrast to the ALP men. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) also spoke about women, and it was very welcome to hear a Liberal man speak on the subject for a change. In view of the event whose anniversary this evening is&mdash;namely, the 50th anniversary of the maiden speech in the House of Representatives of Dame Enid Lyons, the first woman ever elected to this chamber&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Dame Enid had to retire early because of ill health. Her biography tells us that, as she grew older, after leaving this place, her health improved. I met her at a function in Canberra in 1976 when, as I recall, she was past 80 years of age. I had never dreamt that I would ever meet her and was thrilled to have the opportunity and the privilege. Her speech that day was challenging and sharp&mdash;a clear indication of the vigour of her intellect and the strength of her personality. When I was introduced to her that day she urged&mdash;even instructed&mdash;me to stay in parliament for a long time. I suspect her own premature retirement from the House of Representatives was a matter of enduring and continuing regret to her, but I did not have the nerve to broach the subject with her then. </PARA>

Her courage in taking that great step into the Commonwealth parliament is something that we should acknowledge and that all Australian women should be grateful for.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the 1980s it seems to have become almost mandatory that whoever runs government organisations should preferably be ignorant of the organisation's workings and public purpose.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public institutions such as the Federal Airports Corporation, the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority, Telecom, Qantas, and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation are all more or less examples of this syndrome. The ABC is now a particularly well advanced case. The thrust towards pay TV, together with advertising on the Asian service and SBS, the spread of overt and covert sponsorship, coproductions, reduction of program makers and advertising thinly disguised as documentary on programs such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Everybody</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Consuming Passions</EMPHASIS> and the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Home Show</EMPHASIS>, certainly indicates the beginning of the end.

It will prove fatal to its role as an independent broadcaster and possibly the most important cultural institution in this country. It is inevitable that pay TV will bleed the free to air services of resources and program materials. No amount of `black is white' jargon statements about pay TV `boosting' the free to air service by `pumping in' revenue or by commissioning and buying programs or ideas that we will `lose the plot' will alter that fact. </PARA>

In other words, access to independent and high quality information for both adults and children is now subject to the capacity to pay and ultimately the censorship of the sponsor. New Zealand has shown that, after three years of Sky television, only seven per cent of households use the service. So much for providing an injection of funds for free to air television!

The ABC pay TV is commercially, and in quality programming terms, a dead duck. All that it will do is lead to a transfer of resources from the ABC radio and free to air television which are already stretched. The Fraser government began the squeeze in the 1970s, but since 1983 Labor governments have steadily eroded the role of the ABC.
