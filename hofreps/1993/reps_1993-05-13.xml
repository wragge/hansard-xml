Having known Bruce in both the New South Wales and Federal parliaments, I have always found him to be a very amiable companion. Travelling together only enhanced my view of him. He was at all times most pleasant and very constructive&mdash;a true gentleman in the finest sense of the word.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That aside, I would like to thank all the members of the delegation for their contribution. Having myself participated in only the Malaysian leg of a three-country tour, I was somewhat fresher than the other delegates, who looked a little drained on our first meeting in Kuala Lumpur. Nevertheless, we all warmed to the occasion and enjoyed what was a fascinating and successful visit. The visit could not have been so successful without the efforts of Frank Murray and all the staff of the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur. I would like to place on the record my appreciation of their efforts both before and during the visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that in the period between the visits of the 1988 and 1992 delegations the High Commission had to manage a very difficult period in the bilateral relationship. As the focal point of government efforts to both articulate Australia's position and return relations to an even keel, theirs was not always a comfortable or enjoyable task. Nevertheless, what was and always has been a solid bilateral relationship was very much on a secure footing by the time of our arrival in June 1992. Indeed, the delegation's visit was symbolic of the full rapprochement which had been achieved in the preceding year or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solid level of the relationship was underlined by the high-level access that the delegation was accorded. In addition to being received by the President of the Senate, the delegation met with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Defence, Justice and Finance. These meetings gave the delegation a feel for the Malaysian priorities and policy perceptions. While much is made of the differences which periodically surface, there remains a strong degree of shared outlook which stems from our joint status as middle ranking Commonwealth Asian-Pacific powers. The strength of the bilateral relationship has been forged on our close defence, five-power and educational ties. However, this is increasingly being complemented by growing economic linkage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of our visit figures were released showing that Australia had the highest foreign investment in Malaysia for the first quarter of 1992. Although a large investment by BHP contributed greatly to this, it was evidence of the growing importance of Australian capital to Malaysia's impressive eight per cent per annum economic growth. If trade and investment are to continue their rapid growth, it will depend to a significant degree on there being an open and liberal trading regime in the area. It was plain from our discussions that Malaysia and Australia shared the same view on this, although there is some debate about the most appropriate vehicle to guarantee open regional trade. By encouraging more people to people contact, growing trade and investment are helping to bring our countries together in a way generations of Malaysian students studying in Australia have in the past. Indeed, the two developments are complementary, as Australian investors can find a rich source of contacts and expertise in the ranks of former Malaysian students in Australia. This is boosted by the strong English language tradition and the impressive infrastructure which has quickly been developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Culturally, the delegation witnessed positive developments in the relationship, prominent amongst them an exhibition of Kuruwarri ancestral art at the Selangor State Museum in Shah Alam. For my part, that was one of the highlights of the visit. What was also very encouraging was the very positive reception from our hosts to the idea of having more leadership and cultural exchanges, in particular a young leaders exchange. Such contact can only enhance future understandings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation was left in no doubt that now and in the future the media will have an important role to play in the bilateral relationship. Having been a source of friction at times, the media could also promote greater awareness of each other's societies. It would be helpful, I think, to the process of understanding if an Australian media organisation&mdash;at least one and hopefully more&mdash;had a permanent presence in KL; a permanent presence exhibiting the right mix of cultural sensitivity and commitment to freedom of expression. In the absence of a permanent presence, short-term journalistic exchanges and working visits with access to the Malaysian Government would be worth promoting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will leave it to my colleague the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), to give his view of what I regarded as a very successful visit. I thank him for his support in the delegation. In summing up my overall impression, I will simply say that it was one of a relationship on the upswing, with enormous potential for economic, cultural and political expansion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My last personal exposure to Malaysia was in the 1950s, when I was there as a young serviceman during the communist insurgency period. As honourable members may well imagine, that country has changed out of all recognition in the intervening 35 years, which may indicate why I have a few grey hairs. I am not going to go through the detail of the report, but there are a few key things that we need to take on board as Australians in our relationship with Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I make is about education. We have some 10,000-odd Malaysian students coming to our universities in this country. Right across Malaysia it was made very clear to us by our own staff there and the Malaysian Government and individuals that there is an urgent need for us to provide more places. That does two things: it provides more cash for this country, if we can create those places, but the real benefit is in the longer term, because many of the future leaders of that country will come from that group who go to university. Rather than have them going off to America or the UK or somewhere like that and learning the culture there and making contacts with the future leaders of those countries, they really ought to be doing it here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Butterworth we had a comprehensive briefing on the five-power defence arrangements It was disappointing that the schedule could not be arranged so that we could meet the Australian service personnel but, again, it is an area where there is plenty of opportunity for future Australian cooperation with Malaysia and for enhancement of our relationships with that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of the Australian media, it was made very clear on a number of occasions that no Australian media organisation has a presence in Malaysia. Of course, our media have been the source of some past problems between the two countries. It seems to me that if the media understood some of the Malaysian environment a bit better some of those problems may not have been so difficult. I am not suggesting that the media need to be stifled, but I do believe that, if they were better informed by having an on the ground presence, we might find that some of those difficulties would not occur in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the coalition's representative on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and as a member in the last Parliament of the House of Representatives Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I was particularly pleased to attend the exhibition of Aboriginal art at the Selangor State Museum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In economic matters, the overwhelming impression is one of very competent planning. In Kuala Lumpur there is a national planning organisation; each of the States has a State planning organisation. At Malacca we visited an Australian company, Ansell International. We are grateful to the people there for their hosting of us. It is important to note that that company is not there just for cheap labour but because the country has a more progressive attitude to business planning. There are tax incentives; there are all sorts of land opportunities there. The Australian businesses go there for very positive reasons, so we are competing against that in this country and need to be aware of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are considerable environmental problems in Malaysia, and we have the skills and expertise to help, to cooperate and develop our businesses there.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Penang there are some lessons for Australia about incentives and quick decisions. Businesses there have a one-stop shop approach. Increasingly, they are moving away from that cheap labour-intensive area into more high-tech areas. Perhaps there is also a lesson in terms of a new international airport, which in Malaysia has been planned, approved and is off and running, whilst we are still talking about one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We visited a refugee camp where some of the children had been born and had lived for eight years. We should not forget that there are still refugees in that country&mdash;from Vietnam in particular&mdash;who need to be looked after. One of our number, Senator Chamarette, paid a visit to Michael McAuliffe, an Australian under sentence of death, and we raised with the Government our concerns with regard to the death penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I echo the thanks to Frank Murray, the High Commissioner, and his staff and to Peter Hicks, the secretary of the delegation. Finally, I stress that Malaysia has the same size population as Australia. It has made tremendous progress in the last 30 years, certainly coming off a lower base, but it seems to me that it is a good example of what national discipline and dedication can achieve. Perhaps we should take note from that lesson. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Republic of Korea and Pakistan from 10 to 23 June 1992. In case my colleagues think I spend my life travelling, let me say that this trip was actually part of the trip to Malaysia that I spoke on before. We went to Korea and Pakistan and then the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), who spoke previously, joined us for the Malaysian leg of the trip. The leader of the delegation was Lloyd O'Neil, who is no longer in the Parliament. The deputy was Bruce Cowan, the previous member for Lyne, who is also no longer in the Parliament. Senator Chamarette joined us, as did my colleague the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman), who will speak after me this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was my first visit to Korea, and it was a very impressive exercise. Korea is Australia's third most important export market, mostly in bulk commodities, and therefore this country nurses its relationship with Korea very carefully. Australian Ministers make frequent visits to that country, and vice versa. The relationship between Australia and Korea is developing in important new areas, including science and technology developments and increases in tourism, both to and from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are a number of problems in the relationship. The phrase `supply diversification' had not actually registered with me very much before I went to Korea. Supply diversification means that, even if we can supply all of the iron ore that Koreans need at the best price in the world, they are still not going to buy it all from us. They might, for example, buy a third from us, a third from a second country and a third from another country. The Koreans do that for three reasons: firstly, to ensure that they have competition; secondly, if there are any industrial relations problems or whatever here, it means that they have continuity of supply; and, thirdly and perhaps more importantly, it enables them to keep the downward price pressure on the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also raised questions of market liberalisation, particularly for beef and rice. We can produce rice much more efficiently than they can there. I have to report that, in real world terms, we got nowhere. The Koreans have a political lobby and have, I think, very little intention of moving on those aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They did express a number of concerns about the proposed Japanese peacekeeping operations. The reasons for that concern are historical. Over the last 500 or 600 years the Japanese have invaded Korea on a number of occasions. The thought that the Japanese might be sending some troops overseas, for whatever purpose, certainly produces heartburn in most Koreans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had the opportunity to visit the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea. Of course, reunification is a major issue and has been for a long time. We got the very clear impression that reunification is not a question of if, but of when and how. I think there has been a slight cooling of their ardour in that respect since they have seen the impact on the German economy of the reunification of Germany. Whilst South Korea is going very well in economic terms, North Korea is certainly not, and I think the South Koreans have learnt a couple of salutary lessons about the potential damage it could do to their economy when reunification occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We visited the Pohang Iron and Steel Corporation in the south of the country. I have visited steelworks in this country and in one or two other parts of the world, and I found visiting this Korean steelworks to be a very interesting experience indeed. That visit is reported in the delegation's report as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A feature of the Delegation's visit to South Korea was the opportunity to meet with POSCO &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Pohang Iron and Steel Corporation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">representatives and inspect its operations. POSCO is Australia's single most important customer in South Korea purchasing $500 million worth of coal and iron ore annually. This represents about 17 per cent of Australia's total exports to South Korea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Korea's steel industry was established with technical assistance from Australia. Initially POSCO was a government owned enterprise but now private enterprise is a significant shareholder.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">POSCO's physical operations were impressive not only in scale but also in their standard of technical efficiency. One particularly commendable aspect is the high priority given to the environmental impact of the company's operations through a system of emission monitoring and control.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, POSCO's operations and a major tourist activity are almost collocated and it is hard to pick the difference. We walked around that steelworks wearing white gloves, touching everything in sight, and when we gave back the gloves they were as white as when we put them on. It was a very impressive situation. The Korean record on human rights was not as impressive. Everywhere we went there were riot troops on the streets and, of course, Amnesty International is still reporting concerns in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are tremendous environmental problems in Korea. In Seoul one cannot see very far when one gets up in the morning, even if one is in a high-rise hotel, because of the pollution. Also, the traffic is quite appalling. That is part of the cost of Korea's economic progress and Koreans are beginning to start to take some notice of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would certainly like to thank our hosts in Korea. I thank Mr Gribble, the Australian Ambassador, and his staff. I thank also the Australian Consul in Pusan, the management of POSCO and all those who helped in planning the trip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn now to the Pakistan leg of the visit. I last stopped off in Pakistan about 35 years ago. I did not expect to be in this House talking about that visit. During the trip Mr O'Neill and Mr Cowan, who are no longer with us, were presented with some local costumes. They were going to come into this chamber to present this report wearing the local costumes. I have to tell the House that they have now gone and taken the costumes with them so I could not provide that little bit of local colour for this morning's occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the first Australian parliamentary delegation to visit Pakistan. We received a very warm reception but I have to say&mdash;and honourable members will have gathered this from the news this morning&mdash;that security is a big issue in that country. Everywhere we went, guns were evident. The streets had to be closed for our convoy. We went to Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar, and we visited the Khyber Pass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to meeting various Ministers, officials and business people, we had meetings with Benazir Bhutto and with some civil rights groups. We talked to a number of groups about the treatment of women in that country&mdash;which I have to say, in our terms, leaves an incredible amount to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We received a lot of press coverage. There are a number of difficult issues there. There is the conflict with India over Kashmir, which is the reason why Pakistan states that it requires a nuclear capability. Another effect, in terms of the dispute with India over Kashmir, is that it is the justification for spending incredible amounts of money on defence. A very high proportion of the national budget, in a very poor country, is spent on defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Afghanistan has been a problem that has resulted in many refugees entering Pakistan. When we visited the Khyber Pass we watched the refugees starting to go back to Afghanistan at the rate of 7,000 a day. They were living in quite appalling conditions. We visited a refugee camp in Peshawar. There were 200,000 people in just one of dozens and dozens of camps around the country. The countryside has been stripped bare by the inhabitants of those camps in their search for firewood. Diet and hygiene are at very basic levels. Pakistan is doing its best to cope with those issues but really it is an appalling situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On broader issues, the break-up of the former Soviet Union, right on the border of Pakistan, is raising concerns because of the fear of the emergence of old tensions in some of the smaller countries that are now emerging there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pakistan certainly needs more aid if it is to deal with a number of incredible problems. One is the environment. Only four per cent of the forestry cover is left and that, of course, means that the soil is just blowing away. The country has tremendous water pollution problems as well. The population of 135 million is increasing at an amazing rate. It is overwhelmingly young and, of course, where there is a young and aggressive population that is not educated and very poor, there is the potential for serious problems to develop in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the education area, the literacy rate is only 25 per cent. There is a 64 per cent attendance rate at primary school, 24 per cent at secondary school, and only 2 per cent of the population receive tertiary education. It seems to me that that is another area where Australia could look to provide aid in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of human rights I would just like to read one small paragraph from our report. We have said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Delegation's view that the human rights situation in Pakistan remains quite unsatisfactory on many fronts. Specific matters brought to the attention of the Delegation include the use by police of fictitious and old First Information Reports (FIRs) to initiate arrests, killings by security personnel, women averaging at least two years in prison before their cases go to court and the rape of female activists in police stations and polling stations.</PARA>
<PARA>There really is quite a bad record there. We visited our mine clearance training personnel, who are engaged on very hazardous work. We recognise that they are there and compliment them on the fine work they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would certainly like to thank our hosts in that country. I would like to thank Roy Clogstromm, the acting High Commissioner, and his staff; the Korean and Pakistan representatives in this country who helped plan our visits; and Peter Hicks, the secretary to the delegation. In conclusion, in both of the countries that we went to, we had a warm reception. Pakistan, in particular, is a country of incredible problems. By comparison, we are very much the lucky country. When one visits a place like that and comes back here, one very much appreciates being an Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, in your absence from the chair yesterday, I did congratulate you through your Deputy. I will not do so again, but I do present the Social Security Amendment (Listed Securities) Bill 1993 and the explanatory memorandum to it. The coalition made a commitment last year to review the Government's proposal to treat unrealised capital gains on listed shares held by pensioners and other beneficiaries as income. That was a commitment we made after very wide consultation with interested groups. Particularly in the context of during the election and afterwards, we in the Opposition decided to repeal this section of legislation that had previously been enacted; and this Bill seeks to do just that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the six months since the Government brought in legislation amending the Social Security Act to provide for the treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares held by pensioners and other beneficiaries as income, there has been a great deal of evidence now made available that the schema that the Government has proposed is unlikely to realise its objective. We know from the department that there is something in the order of 81,000 pensioners who hold shares and, of these, 60,000 are expected to be affected by this measure. The Government has suggested that, in relation to those 60,000 pensioners, there will be an average reduction of about $1,100 a year. That is the very reason that they expect to save $61 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On questioning the Department of Social Security in relation to that matter, what has become very clear is that it made no assumptions whatever about the impact that these proposals would have upon the behaviour of pensioners. I think every honourable member ought to be concerned about this provision. It will affect something in the order, on average&mdash;some will have more, others will have less&mdash;of 400 beneficiaries or 400 pensioners in each electorate. It is not a small matter: it is a major matter&mdash;400 pensioners, on average, in every electorate around Australia. It is going to be a large number of people affected by this particular proposal. It will reduce their income very significantly, on the Government's estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what we know from all the publicity that has been associated with this is that not only are people being counselled and advised to change their behaviour, but that is exactly what they will do. The Government made no assumptions whatever about changing behaviour in its calculations. In other words, the $61 million that it expects to save will not be a saving at all. One situation I have likened it to is the Government's proposals to impose a sales tax on luxury motor vehicles. It expected to raise a great deal of money from that proposal. It took no account of changed behaviour: people stopped buying luxury motor vehicles and, of course, there were no savings at all, and in the end the Government had to walk away from the particular proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is nonsense to think that in the discipline of economics people can make judgments about saving large sums of money without taking into account changed behaviour and behavioural aspects. Senator Richardson, in the other place, where a similar Bill has been introduced, endeavoured to undermine our approach in relation to this matter by suggesting it was going to have minimal impact, and that it was only very wealthy pensioners with shareholdings in excess of $100,000 who would be affected by this proposal. He is deluding himself if he thinks that is the case, and honourable members opposite are like lemmings if they think that those arguments hold any validity. The fact is that the particular proposals that the Government has advanced will not achieve the planned outcome, as they are fundamentally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals are harsh and unconscionable in the way in which they create new inequities. People will be able to move their investments in shares to other non-capital gains affected property, such as caravans, holiday houses and other collectables. The Government's proposals will undermine the certainty of investment decisions that pensioners might be able to take and will result in less investment in Australia by people who are often in a better position to undertake investments. In other words, the proposals are flawed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)expresses its concern at the suffering of the Somali people and at the breakdown of Government, civil administration and law and order as a result of internal warfare;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)expresses its congratulations and appreciation of the Australian troops in Somalia for their outstanding contribution towards peacemaking in Somalia; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)acknowledges the tremendous support of the people of Australia for the serving men and women of the Australian Defence Force in Somalia.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to thank the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) for allowing me, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), Senator MacGibbon and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) to travel to Somalia to witness at first-hand the conditions in that country and the operations of the Australian troops. I express my sorrow that in the middle of the trip Mr Halverson's mother passed away and that a present illness prevents him from speaking on this motion, which I know he would be only too happy to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank Major John Withers, our escort officer, who did an outstanding job in shepherding the politicians and two journalists, Ian McPhedran from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> and Max Blenkin from AAP, who accompanied us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations has had 26 peacekeeping operations and Australia has so far participated in 17 of them. I believe that the Australian Defence Force is doing Australia proud in this new area of activity and nowhere more so than in Somalia. No TV clip or newspaper report adequately prepares one for what is seen. It is a level of destruction that I have not witnessed before and, more sadly, it is not the result of natural causes but is man-made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best analogy I can give with respect to Baidoa is for us to imagine our own suburbs with every house destroyed; if walls are left standing, anything of value within them has been removed. But the destruction is not just of the houses; it applies to the schools, the courts, the orphanages and to any public infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We travelled through Mogadishu. It is a city of one million people and conditions were the same there. To give the House a feeling of what it was like when the Australians arrived at Baidoa&mdash;a city of some 25,000 people&mdash;every day 300 people were dying on the streets from either gunshot wounds or famine. Of course, all this has changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly pay tribute to the commander of the Australian operations in Somalia, Colonel Bill Mellor, to Lieutenant-Colonel Dave Hurley in Baidoa, and to the captain of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS>, Captain Kevin Taylor, as well as to all their serving men and women&mdash;they are doing an outstanding job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may recall that the mission of the Australian troops was to ensure the safety of the non-government organisations and the delivery of food to starving people. Certainly they have done that and they have done it exceedingly well, but they have done much more than that: they have been able to provide security within Baidoa and its surrounds. They have liaised with the local population very well and everywhere we went and were recognised as Australians, we were greeted by men, by women and by children. It was very easy to see that Australians were there because I must say that occasionally one of the children would greet us with a very colloquial Australian expression which they could have only learnt from Australian troops. They were held in the highest possible regard by the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It did not matter whom we talked to in Somalia, whether it was the commanding general of UNOSOM, General Bir from Turkey, or the head of the UNITAF forces, General Johnston from the United States, who was second in command in the Gulf&mdash;they praised the activities of the Australian troops in Somalia and the way they had gone about securing their area of operations. Indeed, they often said it was a model from which other countries had much to learn. When we spoke to elders in Baidoa or when we spoke to them in Audidilly or when we travelled to Berakaba, the consistent theme that came to us was what a terrific job the Australians had done but, please, can they stay. Of course, it was a decision of the Government, fully supported by the Opposition, that this be a one-term tour of duty of 17 weeks, which I might say is now drawing to its conclusion, and that there would be no replacement troops from Australia. As I say, they have done their jobs extremely well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also tell the House that we were privileged to visit some of the non-government organisations in Baidoa, and in particular Care Australia. Whilst the Australian troops have done a tremendous job, I think everyone would agree with me that the non-government organisations at times have acted quite courageously in their operations. It is a point of sadness for us, I think, that at the time the Australian troops are withdrawing, so too is Care Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I talked about the level of destruction. I suppose we were privileged when we were there because we were told that conditions had improved so much and the physical conditions of the areas we had seen had improved so much. But I would like to make two comments about the United Nations. One recurring theme we heard over there was that the United Nations had initially been very slow to move. If that is well founded, the Somalian people have paid an awful price. For us parliamentarians travelling there, there was a frustration that, given the relative security, there was little sign of reconstruction. Given that the Australians had moved with speed to secure an outstanding level of security, the slowness in the reconstruction of Somalia is a matter of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to say that, even though the cooks always get a bad time, by using American rations and Australian rations they were able to have in Baidoa the best mess, by all accounts, in the whole of Somalia. They were operating 24 hours a day and, of course, also volunteering for their stints of security duties. To my American friends I would just like to pass an observation that generally I think the relationship between Australia and America is outstandingly good, but this could become threatened if ever they want to extend their MREs&mdash;meals ready to eat&mdash;to the rest of the world. They are singularly awful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would make a couple of suggestions to the lessons-learnt team that went across with us. Firstly, fresh food, even occasionally, would have made a big improvement to the severe conditions under which our serving men and women were working. Secondly, the absence of helicopters was puzzling, to say the least. In the type of operations that were being conducted in Somalia, helicopters would have given them speed and would have been a force multiplier. If they are not appropriate in Somalia, one wonders how they can be justified in limited contingencies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I think it is probably appropriate to revisit the issue of whether Australia needs Galaxies. The Hercules&mdash;and I will mention that in a minute&mdash;have a capacity, I think, for about six pallets, whereas the Galaxies have a capacity for something like 26. When we want to move significant numbers of men and women and equipment&mdash;as we did in this battalion group&mdash;having that larger capacity and then being able to disperse cargo with the Hercules seems to me to make sense. But I am sure that the lessons learnt team will take all those comments into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing I cannot thank Senator Robert Ray for was the mode of transport. It took us three days to get to Somalia and three days to get back, and the 13-hour leg from Cocos to Richmond was unendurable, particularly given that the heater had broken down. In conclusion, I would like to thank all the members of the delegation. I would like to thank all the serving men and women and the people that we met in Baidoa for their kindness and generosity. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed a pleasure this morning to provide strong bipartisan support to this motion by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price). Having spoken to the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) yesterday, I know he would like to have been here but I am sure he is not going to disagree with anything that the honourable member for Chifley, following speakers and I say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little doubt about three things: firstly, the tragedy that was and is Somalia; secondly, the professionalism of the Australian Defence Force in that country; and, thirdly, the strong national support for our international efforts in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first question that we should all be asking ourselves this morning is: why did Australia do what it did? It is perhaps worth reminding the House of some of the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the tragedy, in his statement on 17 December last year. I will read some excerpts from that statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the end of the dictatorial rule . . . in January 1991, the political and economic institutions in Somalia have disintegrated. Fighting between shifting factional coalitions has compounded the effects of years of economic mismanagement and drought, and led to starvation and political anarchy on a massive scale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Famine and clan warfare have so far taken the lives of an estimated quarter of a million Somalis. About two million people, or a third of Somalia's pre-war population, are still at risk of starvation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A response was attempted in April this year when the United Nations Security Council&mdash;through Resolution 751&mdash;established a peacekeeping operation, UNOSOM, to maintain a ceasefire, to promote a political settlement and to provide urgent humanitarian assistance. But UNOSOM was slow to get under way and was not structured adequately to deal with the problems it faced.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The world was appalled to see Somalis continuing to starve while food donated by the international community was plundered by armed gangs or remained in warehouses because safe passage could not be guaranteed. Violence and extortion continued unabated and those UN troops who did arrive in Somalia found themselves confronted by lack of cooperation and hamstrung by their restrictive rules of engagement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was against this bleak background that President Bush made his ground-breaking offer to provide substantial US troops to a new international coalition of forces that would enforce peace in Somalia, not simply try to keep it. The world community, and specifically the United Nations Security Council, welcomed the President's offer and sanctioned Operation Restore Hope through Resolution 794 on 3 December. Member states were invited by the United Nations to contribute to a multinational force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided&mdash;in response to resolution 794 and at the invitation also of the United States&mdash;to make a large-scale commitment of Australian forces to Operation Restore Hope.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation is intended to create a secure environment for the provision of humanitarian relief in Somalia. . . The United Nations has never before sanctioned intervention on such a scale in the internal affairs of a member state for humanitarian purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is imperative that Operation Restore Hope succeed, not only to help the people of Somalia, but also as a demonstration that the international community, through the United Nations, is capable of responding promptly and effectively to a crisis of this scale.</PARA>
<PARA>He finished by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our contingent will total about 900 personnel, including four rifle companies from 1st Battalion, a reduced squadron of about 30 armoured personnel carriers, and logistic and engineer support elements.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose the second question this morning that we should ask is: how successful have we been in our contribution? I think the degree to which we have been successful is best encapsulated in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 20 April by Ian McPhedran headed `Troops help to secure a future for Baidoa'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Baidoa&mdash;200km inland from Mogadishu&mdash;is slowly but surely returning from the dead, thanks to the vigilance of the 1st Battalion Royal Australian Regiment and other Australian personnel working in the ravaged region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than 300 people a day were dying in Baidoa last August, victims of famine, disease or violence in a lawless land laid waste by mother nature and clan rivalry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today Baidoa&mdash;and the 17,000 sq km around the town which is under Australian control&mdash;is essentially secure and the people are getting on with the task of rebuilding their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The acting team leader for Care Australia in Baidoa, Anne Morris, said that without the Australian troops the clans and their notorious "technicals"&mdash;open vehicles with heavy weapons mounted on them&mdash;would still reign in Baidoa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without the army to escort aid convoys into the villages, the anarchy that we witnessed here from last August would still be on, and the people still dying in their thousands.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Morris went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the region had been transformed from the city of death to the city of life, thanks largely to the Australian forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She said the Somali people did not want the Australians to leave the area next month but she was certain the French&mdash;who will take over from the Australians&mdash;would be in no mood to let security drop.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the final question, and perhaps the most important question, is: what about Somalia's future? Again, I think this was very well covered in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 3 March, entitled `Mission Improbable' by Cameron Stewart, in which he said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initial task of the troops&mdash;to ensure safe delivery of food aid to a country where 300,000 have died from two years of famine and war&mdash;has been a remarkable success. But it contrasts starkly with the lack of progress towards establishing the structures for long-term stability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The message from most ordinary Somalis is blunt: if the soldiers leave, the country will again descend into chaos.</PARA>
<PARA>He finished the article by referring to some British explorers in the country last century. He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than a century later, Speke's description is still accurate and underpins the fact that Somalia's problems will not be solved by a short-term international food blitz. They are ingrained in a complex cultural tradition which will test the patience, fairness and resolve of the West for longer than it may wish.</PARA>
<PARA>I have little doubt that Australia will continue to exercise its mind on this international quandary. I would like to finish by paying tribute to a number of people and to a number of organisations. Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the United Nations for its foresight and its commitment to the plight of a tragic people and also to its ongoing dedication to peacekeeping operations around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I would like to pay tribute to the Australian people, without whose strong support this humanitarian effort would not have been possible. I would like to pay tribute to both sides of this House whose bipartisan support ensured that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, I would like to pay tribute, of course, to the Australian Defence Force in general: to the Army, Navy and Air Force elements, and to 1RAR and its supporting elements in particular. I also mention 1RAR's commander, Lieutenant-Colonel David Hurley, and the force commander, Colonel Bill Mellor. I want to pay tribute to the professionalism of all of them, and to their ability to get a job done without any fuss&mdash;not only in military terms, but beyond&mdash;in particular, in the restoration of justice to the area of Baidoa. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the non-government aid agencies, without whom this humanitarian effort and many others around the world would not have been the success that they clearly are. I salute all concerned in once again coming to grips with this, yet another example of man's inhumanity to man. All of us should be very proud of their collective efforts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one of the members of the delegation, I recently had the privilege of travelling to Somalia with the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) and Senator David MacGibbon. I must say at the outset that the experience of seeing a country totally destroyed and the level that the people had been reduced to was something which I do not wish to see ever again. At the same time, I feel it was also an experience to see how so many other countries of the world could actually come together to restore hope to the country of Somalia&mdash;and restore hope they have indeed done. Just a few weeks ago, CARE Australia's acting leader in Baidoa, Ms Anne Morris, pointed out the huge changes which have occurred there, going from a situation where some 200 to 300 people were dying per day to a situation where essentially the people were no longer starving and, in fact, were in quite reasonable health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In paying tribute to the Australian forces in their efforts in Somalia, we must, as the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) pointed out, also thank honourable members on both sides of the House and also members of the Australian population for supporting this operation. The United Nations needs to take on board the need to move more quickly to ensure that it has the resources and the capabilities of ensuring that such a thing never happens to another country again. There are a number of learning experiences or situations in Somalia which I must relate in the short time that I have. In doing that, I would like to feel that I can show honourable members in some brief way how hope has been restored to the Somalian population, in particular in the Baidoa HRS&mdash;the humanitarian relief sector&mdash;that the Australian forces are responsible for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw this hope at first hand while visiting an orphanage in Baidoa. Dr Mohomoud Iman, the director of that orphanage, was most grateful for the Australian operation and the way that the Australian forces have conducted themselves, and particularly for the way CARE Australia was providing food. Going to the orphanage, where some 900 children gave us a rousing welcome, was a privilege and an experience which was very moving to all members of the delegation. Evidence of hope being restored was the fact that, although there were still a large number of refugees around the city, the numbers of refugees had been actually reduced to some one-tenth of what they had been just a few months previously. The fact that they were able to move back out into the outlying country areas was indicative of the security of those areas and of how the Australian troops were operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, when we were visiting the village of Buurhakba, our interpreter, Ali Haji Mucktar, pointed out to me that in the village markets the people were working on building farm equipment&mdash;hoes and the like&mdash;rather than producing weapons such as bayonets. They had changed; they had seen the way forward and they were moving towards that, and there was much evidence that the people did see light at the end of the tunnel. As the honourable member for Chifley pointed out, there was also the evidence of people coming up to us in the streets and in the villages, expressing their gratitude for what the Australians have done, whether it was in the vernacular or just a simple thankyou. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Major John Withers, the escort officer for the delegation, for the great job that he did. I certainly appreciated it. I also want to mention the village elder in Baidoa, a gentlemanly 83-year-old called Mulak Muktar Malar Hassan who, as the village chief, expressed his appreciation for what the Australian troops achieved in the area. He and the village people cooperated because they could see the way forward. They were confident enough to support the Australian troops who were helping to establish the local constabulary to help maintain order. We also picked up the fact that the Australian troops had gone on some degree of mission creep, which is the term the honourable member for Chifley used, in getting that constabulary established to ensure that the security of the area will be maintained after the Australian troops withdraw. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

As new members, we all hope that there will not be many dangerous occasions such as this which Australians will be called upon to participate in.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night I was honoured to be a guest, along with the Deputy Speaker and many other parliamentarians, of the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Grey, at the Army officers mess in Canberra. I was struck by the photographs on the wall that depicted some of the activities of our magnificent armed forces in Somalia. I pay tribute to the skill of those photographers who managed to depict, in a way that no words from me could ever adequately equal, the contribution of our armed forces in Somalia. I hope that those photographs, perhaps with the cooperation of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, may soon be placed on display in Parliament House to complement the motion of the honourable member for Chifley. </PARA>

The Australian Labor Party presented its policies at Bankstown on 24 February 1993 under a platform statement of `Advancing Australia. Building on strength'. Coupled with the formal announcements they distributed widely this document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Labor Party. Election 1993. Policies for older Australians</EMPHASIS>. That was the document and it was distributed widely by every Labor member and candidate seeking election to the Parliament. On page 5 under the heading Tax Reform, it had this to say:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the estimated impact on Government revenue of the commitment to remove all full and part-rate pensioners from the tax system by 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>She asked him what it would cost. You know the way these things are done, do you not, Mr Deputy Speaker? The question is asked of the Minister's representative in the other House and the representative writes to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and says, `How do I answer this question? It is a difficult one. How do I answer it, Treasurer?'. Senator Patterson went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the Government's best estimate of the number of pensioners who are now paying tax who will be removed from the tax system as a result of this commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does the Government intend to outline to Parliament and to the Australian public prior to the next federal election how it intends to meet this commitment, including how it will be funded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How will the Government ensure that retirees whose incomes only marginally exceed the part-rate pension income threshold are not comparatively disadvantaged if the Government implements its commitment to remove all pensioners from the tax system by 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What changes to the pension assets test and tax system does the Government envisage . . . </PARA>
<PARA>She asked further questions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Government implements its commitment to remove all pensioners . . . what will be the difference in the tax paid by a pensioner with income $1 below the part-rate pension income threshold and a non-pensioner with an equivalent income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does the Government also intend to remove from the tax system those retirees who make the choice not to claim the age pension although they meet all the requirements of the income and assets tests.</PARA>
<PARA>These were very proper questions. Senator Button answered them: what did he have to say? He confirmed the promise. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1989-90 Budget it was announced that age and service pensioners, both full rate and part rate, would be removed from the taxation system by 1995 in the context of removing disincentives to individuals undertaking retirement savings and encouraging greater self provision in retirement. The cost of the reforms for the aged announced in the April 1989 economic statement and the 1989-90 Budget&mdash;including the 1995 commitment&mdash;was put at over $1 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Treasurer, through Senator Button, told the Senate, `This commitment involves a cost to revenue of over $1 billion', and yet the Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy went to the Australian people with a specific pledge on the Labor Party's commitment to remove all age and service pensioners from the tax system, and told them it was working on details. These disgraceful flyers were put out that suggested to people that they would be removed from the tax system, and yet three weeks after the election&mdash;three weeks after that confirmation&mdash;the Treasurer of this country, said, `It was certainly not an undertaking we have renewed and I don't feel under any obligation to follow through with it'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has been talking about backflips. It is really interesting to hear opposition members speaking about backflips when we see what was in Fightback and how the whole Fightback package has been rejected by the people of Australia. The Opposition has really done a backflip on every policy it ever had, if there ever were any policies. When honourable members opposite come into this place today and rave on about the Government's policies for pensioners and talk about backflips, I remind them that they are the ones who have done the backflips.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the motion of the honourable member for Berowra because I think that pensioners in Australia really said on 13 March what they felt about the Opposition's policies and why they preferred to stay with the Keating Labor Government, and rightly so. Pensioners will benefit from the policy of the Government for all older Australians which was announced in February, which the honourable member opposite has referred to. They will benefit because thousands of part pensioners and retirees throughout Australia will be better off through the new deal for older people announced in the Prime Minister's policy launch. It is true that certain aspects of the policy document are under review since the election, but the package as a whole offers much for pensioners and retirees throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the policy it was announced that there would be an easing of the assets test for pensioners from September 1993 and that the Government would also introduce a senior health card for all part pensioners, extending eligibility for concessional pharmaceuticals and hearing aids. All pensioners and health card holders will be eligible for free dental care. Easing the assets test means that the new cut-out points for part pensioners will be $218,000 for single home owners, $299,000 for single non-home owners, $335,500 for married home owners and $416,000 for married non-home owners. In addition, the Government is increasing the amount paid to part pensioners. For example, a single retiree with assets of $150,000 on top of the family home will now receive a pension of $100 per week, an increase of $19. I am pleased to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) at the table. He is in a position to respond in support of the Government's initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes mean that the older people will have a higher standard of living and more money for the necessities of life. The Government's senior health card will give low income non-pensioner retirees access to concessional pharmaceuticals and hearing aids as well. In the past, eligibility for concessional pharmaceuticals and hearing aids was limited to pensioners. Labor's initiatives mean all retirees with incomes less than $18,736 for singles, and $31,294 for couples, will be eligible for concessional pharmaceuticals as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these initiatives which will be of great assistance to many older Australians, as part of the seventh accord between the Government and the ACTU, the Government has agreed that unemployed people aged 60 and over and who have been unemployed for 12 months or more will qualify for a provisional age pension. That is the great initiative. This means that from 1 July this year unemployed people over 60, now about 20,000 nationally, will have the option of continuing to seek work and receive unemployment payments or to transfer to a provisional age pension. If these people chose the pension option, many of them will also benefit from the more generous pension income and assets tests. The provisional pension will be introduced from 1 July this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the recent initiatives for pensioners and older Australians, the Labor Government has done a great deal to assist pensioners. This Government has lifted the age pension to over 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, and has indexed the age pension in order to compensate for inflation. We are now in the process of extending fringe benefits to all pensioners, as well as providing all older Australians with universal health insurance as part of this Government's commitment to social justice for the aged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When honourable members opposite start talking about this Government's policies for the aged, it is instructive to take a look at the age care policies taken into the election by honourable members opposite. First off, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) promised to slug every pensioner and senior citizen with a 15 per cent consumption tax on most goods and every service that they used. The imposition of such a tax would have made it very difficult for some pensioners to actually survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Leader of the Opposition tried to tempt the elderly with a fistful of dollars, which he promised would compensate them for the increased cost of living under a GST. However, the $6 billion hole in the Fightback package's arithmetic made such promises by the Opposition absolutely worthless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of a GST would have had the inevitable effect of increasing prices, pushing up inflation and would have affected people on low and fixed incomes&mdash;such as pensioners and retirees&mdash;much more than it would the wealthy. The spending power of people on fixed incomes, such as our pensioners, would have declined dramatically under the policies of honourable members opposite. Even on the coalition's own estimates, a consumption tax would have increased inflation by 4.7 per cent, while the independent Treasury analysis found that Fightback would have increased inflation by up to 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition's proposed income tax cuts would have done little for people on pensions and retirees&mdash;who do not actually pay tax anyway but who would now have had to pay tax under that proposal&mdash;and they would have had to reduce the value of their savings by whatever the increased inflation rate turned out to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the cost of dying, of course, would have increased under the policies of honourable members opposite. Cemetery plots, coffins, cremations, flowers, and even funeral services themselves would all have increased in price if a GST had been introduced as a result of the last federal election. But the Australian people were too smart for honourable members opposite, that is for sure. The then shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), admitted as much. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. He was a scapegoat. The honourable member for Flinders actually admitted as much during an interview on Brisbane radio station 4QR, during an interview on 11 June last year. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under us, as you go down to be buried, you will be buried at 26 cents a litre cheaper, fuel costs, as we are going to abolish the fuel tax. So, yes, there (will be) a tax on burials, on funerals, but there's an existing tax so it won't be a 15% increase.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Flinders admitted that the cost of dying would go up&mdash;but not necessarily by 15 per cent. Of course, the GST was a much broader tax than just a tax on goods. Basic services, such as electricity, gas, telephone and water accounts, cleaning, Meals on Wheels, hairdressing, garbage collection and car repairs would all have cost more if a GST had been introduced and it would have hit our pensioner population quite severely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to the Government's efforts to extend fringe benefits to all pensioners, pensioner rebates on electricity, phone, gas, water and rates&mdash;most are administered by State and local governments&mdash;would all have been in jeopardy under the coalition's Fightback proposals. It has been a good thing for Australia that they have been thrown out. The coalition's policies did not make any allowances for these rebates to increase to match the price increases which would have occurred as a result of a GST. The cost of the Commonwealth compensating the States for these rebates was not even in the calculations on which the GST package was based. Because of the funding cuts to the States that were proposed in Fightback, it would have been extremely unlikely any compensation would have been provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So before honourable members opposite get up in this place to criticise the Government's policies for older Australians, they should look seriously at the implications of their own policies for pensioners and retirees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our aged people certainly deserve a better deal than what has been proposed by those opposite. Those opposite obviously do not have a great commitment to our aged people&mdash;people on lower incomes. I believe our pensioners, in light of what they have contributed to Australia over many years, always should be looked after and looked after well. I am very pleased that we, as a government, have done that over the last 10 years and I know we will continue to do so in the future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent initiative, where fringe benefits are now going to be extended to all people&mdash;even those on part age pensions&mdash;is extremely good. It is those fringe benefits that people really like to have as a security blanket to ensure that they have good health care and the like&mdash;to ensure that they have some quality of life in their old age.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion put forward by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). Very clearly, the Keating Labor Government has refined the technique of the disposable election promise. For years, this Government has blatantly sought to buy the votes of pensioners with its pledge that by 1995 no pensioner will pay tax. It really had a rather good ring to it&mdash;almost as good as the one about no child living in poverty by 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should have been warned. Now that an election has been won, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) could not wait to get out and announce that the Government is no longer obliged to keep its promise. I must emphasise that this was not some off-the-cuff statement made in the heat of a campaign; it was a commitment that had been made and reiterated over several years. That was then reinforced at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be a great deal of argument to the effect that some pensioners can afford to pay a certain amount of tax and should not have been given this blanket promise. That is an arguable point. Indeed, it was described as drawing an unfair distinction between retired Australians in receipt of age pensions and those living entirely on private income who were offered no such relief. But then, that is a hallmark of the Labor Government. It has done nothing but bring in policies that have been divisive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The promise was made to the pensioners of Australia that by 1995 no pensioner would pay tax. That promise was made. Senator Walsh stated on ABC radio, within a fortnight of the election, that the Government should break its promise to pensioners. At least Senator Walsh displays some intellectual consistency. He has argued that the pledge was irresponsible&mdash;that it should never have been made&mdash;and he declined to serve any longer in a Cabinet that continually placed electoral advantage ahead of fiscal probity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see that this Government takes its former colleague's advice selectively. It ignores him when it proclaims that all pensioners will be removed from the tax system and that Australia can afford the change, but it unhesitatingly takes the cynical course of repudiating the pledge when pensioner votes are no longer needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not going to restore public confidence in the political process as long as the Labor Government treats the electors with such contempt, telling us, in effect, that the ditching of the pre-election pledge is a standard political practice. I hope neither the Treasurer nor his colleagues ever have the gall to lament that Australians are cynical about politics and that the voters feel alienated from the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be interesting to hear from the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), who on Tuesday stood in this House and castigated the Western Australian Government for failing to fulfil an election promise. I hope I have the chance to address that issue this evening. He apparently believes that there is another rule for Labor governments, particularly Treasurers who cannot even argue that they were unaware of the exact situation when they made the promise. We are talking about a tax promise made from the Treasury benches, with the benefit of Treasury advice, not a promise made from Opposition whose members are not in receipt of the full facts. </PARA>

This treaty requires, for the first time in history, that signatories enact penal legislation which makes it a violation of national law to engage in activities prohibited by an international treaty. </PARA>

The verification regime is the most intrusive ever produced in a multilateral arms control agreement. Thousands of facilities will be subject to inspection. Inspectors will have the right to perform challenge inspections without right of refusal at any site about which suspicion has been raised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no particular problem with this motion. I am sorry that I was not in the House to hear the remarks of the motion's mover, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), but unfortunately I was delayed at a meeting. I think that this motion to a great extent is a motherhood-type one. It gives the Government a bit of a pat on the back for doing something that very few people, except for some extreme warmongers, would have any reason to object to. However, to put that in context, one wonders in broad terms about the effect of these conventions. The Government does from time to time&mdash;in fact, I think quite regularly&mdash;sign various conventions. In a broad context, that raises a question about what the process should be for the signing of those conventions and I think there is some valid concern about the processes involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conventions have been signed by this Government&mdash;or by the previous Government, in fact&mdash;that a significant number of people may have had concerns about. Although discussion of those is not particularly relevant today, one that particularly comes to mind that puts this whole issue on the agenda is the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. I do not want to recanvass those issues, but at the time it did raise questions about the process. I believe that the position that we take on this side of the House in respect of conventions broadly is that they ought to be a matter of debate in the Parliament, and that the Parliament ought to give consideration to whether conventions are acceded to or not.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect, I believe there is a danger in giving the Government&mdash;that effectively means the Executive of the Government&mdash;the power, as it has now, to sign such conventions. But that is not to say that this convention is not worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern I have generally about conventions is that the good people sign them and the bad people do not, and we have seen plenty of evidence for that concern. Whilst it might give us a nice, warm feeling this morning to be able to say that Australia has signed this convention that it wants to eliminate all chemical weapons, that is motherhood. It gives us a nice feeling, and it gives other like-minded civilised nations a nice feeling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we do about the baddies? What do we do about Saddam Hussein? In that instance, at least, I suppose we saw some preparedness of the world community via the United Nations to intervene and to take action on an ongoing basis. But even there the methodology becomes flawed because apparently he has been quite able to make it very difficult for the United Nations to enforce its resolutions. Ultimately, the question that comes to my mind in this context is: what is the point of the exercise? I am sorry if the honourable member answered that question; I did not hear him. I hope the point is something other than giving us the good feeling that we are standing up and saying something good. We might well sign a convention that will prevent whaling or prevent the killing of dolphins through driftnets, or whatever, but there is always someone who does not sign, who does not agree and who does not abide by that particular convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the highest profile conventions in existence at the moment are the so-called Geneva conventions. I assume that most countries have agreed to the Geneva conventions which largely govern the conduct of war. That is an interesting exercise in itself, that we should in times of peace agree that, if we are going to have a war, we should conduct it within certain bounds. That is not difficult to do when we are getting on well with our neighbours. We can sit down and agree to what amounts to a convention and it can have the imprimatur of the United Nations. For instance, we could agree on a whole range of issues, such as when we capture prisoners. We could agree not to torture them and to feed them properly. Those Geneva conventions go into great detail not only on the treatment of prisoners but on a whole range of other very important issues. But in very many cases, when the crunch comes, they are thrown out the window. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been very closely involved with the Prisoner of War Association in this country. I am the patron of the Gold Coast branch of the Queensland Prisoner of War Association. Having been a serviceman myself, I am naturally very sympathetic to the plight of prisoners of war. I have read a lot and I commend to all honourable members some of the books that have been written about the treatment of Australian prisoners of war by the Japanese. This has become even more of an issue for me now than it ever was, having read a lot of the documentary evidence on what actually happened to Australians, British servicemen, Dutch servicemen and Thai nationals, and others, on that infamous Burma-Thai railway. In this instance, there was no attempt at propriety nor subscription to any convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 8,000 Australian servicemen died in captivity and they died because they were maltreated. They became ill and they were not given medicine. They were never fed properly and, on reading these books, the descriptions of the sorts of meals that they had would bring tears to one's eyes. They were made to work in terrible conditions when they were desperately ill; some of them were even unable to stand up. Their tormenters said, `We want a hundred men to work on this particular part of the railway today' and the hundred best able to work were chosen, despite the fact that many of them were ill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an issue I want to pursue in this Parliament and I have made a call in this place as recently as yesterday. I want the Australian Government to get serious with the Japanese Government about reparations for POWs who are still alive today. In the twilight years of their lives many of them are still suffering and that is understandable. They spent 3 1/2 years in captivity in the most horrific conditions, not only weather conditions but also every other imaginable sort of condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want the Government&mdash;I know it is an embarrassment to it&mdash;to push this issue. I want it to push the matter through the United Nations. If we are serious about the United Nations and a new world order and what can be achieved by agreeing to these sorts of conventions, then we can surely take the matter of reparations for POWs to the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he talks to his Japanese counterpart, should be prepared to put this on the agenda. I know it is a tough issue. It is certainly offensive to the Japanese. I have remarked in this place on more than one occasion that we have never actually received an apology from the Japanese Government, other than in the most perfunctory of terms, for what the Japanese did to relatives of yours and mine during the Second World War. They have certainly never paid reparations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining POWs, of course, are now getting old. They are elderly, they are still suffering and they have never received a cent for the 3 1/2 years of deprivation and torture and ill treatment that they suffered as prisoners of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make those remarks because there can be no objection to the honourable member's motion. It has my support; it would have the support of every civilised person who heard him talk about it. We must eliminate chemical weapons; we must eliminate nuclear weapons. Ultimately, of course, the execution is much more difficult than the actual process of talking about it. Of course, it also raises the issue of how we control the people who do not want to comply with these conventions and, indeed, how one ensures that they are applied in the time of war as opposed to the time of peace. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>Wilfred Owen, a very famous poet of World War I, described there graphically the effects of a chemical attack during that particular war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chemical warfare has been with us for years. Between the years 431BC and 404BC, the Spartans threw burning mixtures of sulfur and pitch over the walls in the sieges of two Athenian cities, which produced fires that asphyxiated the occupants. In the Middle Ages, Genghis Khan shot huge balls of burning pitch and sulfur into cities as a standard part of his attack. In 1812, Thomas Cochrane, a British naval officer, proposed the burning of ships filled with sulfur to drive Napoleon's forces from fortifications around French ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Crimean War, a British chemist suggested two interesting new munitions. One was a hollow shell, filled with a solution of phosphorous, which would break open on impact, exposing the phosphorous to the air and thus causing fires and blinding smoke. He also suggested a brittle shell, filled with a compound which would burn, that could be used against Russian ships. In that particular instance, those two ideas were rejected by the British War Department. During the American Civil War, both sides either proposed or used chemicals as weapons. In 1905, in the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese were said to have pushed burning rags soaked with arsenic compounds into Russian trenches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are interesting conclusions to be drawn from that period before World War I: firstly, chemical weapons played a sometimes decisive role even before the birth of Christ and, secondly, the use of chemicals&mdash;with the exception of sulfur, which had been mined for about 1,000 years&mdash;was limited only by technology. But it is also interesting that it was seen as immoral long before the large-scale use of chemical weapons in World War I. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, their large-scale use in World War I produced some horrific results, some of which were described in the words of Wilfred Owen earlier. In one particular attack there were 15,000 casualties from the release of chlorine gas in the first stages of gas warfare in the First World War. We saw the use by the Germans of mustard gas&mdash;first introduced on 12 July 1917 and delivered in liquid form by artillery shells. The extent of its use is indicated by the fact that, in the 10 days following the introduction of that gas, they fired one million shells at the Allies and gave themselves an advantage&mdash;in fact, almost a monopoly&mdash;on chemical weapons for over a year. The potency of those weapons was such that lethal amounts of mustard gas were still being discovered in the Verdun area in France up to the late 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen all the way through the 20th century the use of chemical weapons in horrific and significant ways as part of warfare. The interesting conclusion that supports the intent of the motion of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) is that the use of chemical weapons is on the rise. In the first 20 years after World War II there were no significant confirmed uses of lethal chemical weapons. In the second 20 years there were four to five confirmed uses, including the first military uses of chemical warfare and, for the first time, a two-sided war in which both sides used chemical weapons against each other. </PARA>

<PARA>It is interesting to have just listened to the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) describing the effects of war, particularly the First World War, and to realise that few in this House, in this capital city and within the cities of Australia would realise that that same type of devastation, that same type of war, is now being perpetrated within the rural and country areas of Australia. I cannot start to describe the amount of devastation that exists in these areas because of the continuing drought and the consequent lowering of commodity prices. In many respects the human aspect is as grim as was portrayed in the poem from which he read. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this Parliament and within the capital of Australia we are unappreciative of the depths of the despair and the tragedy out there. There is a feeling that people are not concerned about that tragedy in others. As we debate, in its turn, the republic or a constitutional monarchy we must acknowledge that any system that we have should be based on fairness and equity to all Australians. I am suggesting that there is no fairness or equity when people who are secure in a nine to five job cannot concern themselves with the tragedy that is going on out there. When we can find funds from this Parliament to pay for eminent people's committees to look at the republic or spend $168 million on new headquarters for the Department of Foreign Affairs or perhaps pay $200,000 for a barbecue area for public servants here, we do not understand the depths of the despair that is out there. It is on this subject that I wish to speak today on a purely non-political basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those honourable members who might have heard some of the Easter messages, one of the most telling was one about members of the Rotary club of Charleville who were distributing funds to provide boots for people so that they could go out and work their properties.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the situation&mdash;and I have seen it within my own electorate&mdash;where women and children are being called upon to handle jobs on farms while there are people within the same area who are on the dole and who are sitting back and not helping to relieve that situation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen in my own constituency a farmer who has committed his life's savings&mdash;his superannuation funds and his retirement funds&mdash;to maintaining his property now suffering because the property is in the grip of drought. Families who have farmed their properties for three generations are seeing the value of their properties falling away and as a result they are suffering a loss of pride. They see themselves as being failures. This is the tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the economic tragedy. We have heard quite a lot about the plight of the graziers as far as wool is concerned. Export values are diminishing. Commodity prices are dropping right off and as a result there is a deficit in the balance of trade. How much of that is caused by the drought? How much of that is caused by the fact that rural industries and primary industries in Australia cannot contribute because of the circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking also in terms of the human problems. In his maiden speech the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) referred to those people who have taken their own lives. He related one instance. I can relate another. Within my own constituency a farmer who was in the depths of the recession, when faced with trying to save his breeders, went out and shot the calves from those breeders so that the breeders could stay alive. He then used the revolver on himself. I think that is probably the most telling example that I can give. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find that these people have few cash reserves. What they need more than anything else is assistance from people like us, not sympathy. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has said that there is a partnership required. I agree wholeheartedly with him. Only a partnership will get us out of this situation. We need a partnership to help control the financial hardship and the human hardship that the farmers are going through and we also need a partnership for recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the resolution we mention that there are ways that the Government can help. I will just mention a few of the ways it could help. If the Government chose to recognise drought as a natural disaster, that would be of tremendous help. That would bring relief to where it is required. There is need for financial help and while the RAS scheme does give it, it does not give it in the most meaningful way to enable these people to keep going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, on the farm there are certain fixed expenses. There are certain expenses that are necessary to keep the crops and livestock going. Take piping as an example. Assistance with piping to get water to a destination would help. Also, the cost of agistment is going up to about two to three times what it was before.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the motion we mention the need to look at the assets test on the ways in which assistance can be given. Household support is already excluded from the assets test, but there are other things that need to be looked at, particularly Austudy. I understand that during the course of the last election the Minister mentioned the lifting of the assets test on the isolated children's allowance. These are ways in which the Government can move right now to provide some help in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The partnership also should involve the commercial people who run the financial affairs and assist in the consultation. Perhaps the Government might be able to assist the bankers in restructuring the loans&mdash;and I think it has tried to do that. There are inevitable problems when someone has shrinking security. I saw this in the banking inquiry at Charleville where a State instrumentality, the QIDC, was blackmailing an individual to supply more off-farm assets as security so that that person could stay on the farm. It is absolutely criminal when it is a government department that is doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bankers have to recognise that they have to share the  losses in that diminishing security.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government has already acknowledged the extreme hardship faced by our rural community as a result of falling commodity prices and drought. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) mentioned those aspects as being pertinent to the present situation facing farmers across Australia, and particularly the farmers in western Queensland and north-west New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural crisis is complex. The Commonwealth has recognised that it requires an intelligent and multi-pronged approach. In recognition of this, the Commonwealth has implemented an integrated package of policies for rural Australia. These policies are pushing along the process of structural change and rural development, while at the same time they acknowledge the difficult times that face the farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centrepiece of the policy is the rural adjustment scheme. That scheme contains exceptional circumstances provisions to increase support to farmers in times of difficulty, as in the current drought crisis in Queensland and in my own State of New South Wales. It should also be noted that in New South Wales the State government, including its honourable members from the National Party, has failed to support the 100 per cent interest subsidy which the Commonwealth has said it is ready to offer to and support farmers with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Government has, at this time, only agreed to an 80 per cent interest subsidy. This should give the honourable member for Dawson something to think about. The exceptional circumstances provisions recognise that farmers need support through difficult circumstances and that otherwise productive farmers could be forced to leave their farms and so weaken the prospects of the industry to recover in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, in times of exceptional circumstances, special interest subsidies of 100 per cent may be provided to farmers. This funding is available immediately. Further, the cap on the level of assistance payable to applicants under the exceptional circumstances provisions of the rural adjustment scheme has been lifted from $30,000 to $50,000, with further changes being subject to review of the rural adjustment scheme administrative arrangements. I anticipate that this will free up the rural adjustment scheme authorities to deliver the optimum level of assistance. In some cases this may be less than the 100 per cent interest subsidy which should be available now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural adjustment scheme has also been revised to achieve effective structural adjustment of farmer enterprises. It is a long-term view and not a knee-jerk response. The scheme aims to encourage better financial and technical performance in an industry responsive to market signals. The National Farmers Federation President, Graham Blight, has welcomed the $50.6 million drought and wool package. Mr Blight has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Invoking the `exceptional circumstances' provisions of the Rural Adjustment Scheme to assist farmers is a welcome step as it allows them to prove viability over a longer period. However, the onus is now on the States to match the Commonwealth contribution under the RAS so that assistance is available to farmers immediately.</PARA>
<PARA>That was on 28 April. Today the honourable member for Dawson's National Party colleagues in New South Wales have still failed to deliver that 100 per cent subsidy from the New South Wales Government, and I hardly think that under these circumstances the honourable member for Dawson should be trying to play a role as some sort of champion of the bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the Commonwealth, as well as offering exceptional circumstances subsidies of 100 per cent, has in place incentives for enhancing productivity by way of the 50 per cent interest subsidies. Farmers are also able to obtain grants to improve skills and assist with appraising their farm businesses. Support is also available via re-establishment grants to those farmers who do wish to leave the farm sector. The farm household support scheme provides farmers who are unable to get commercial finance with support to meet day-to-day family expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national drought policy contains a series of initiatives which provide an integrated&mdash;and I emphasise the word `integrated'&mdash;approach and not a scatter gun approach to land management and financial security, by incorporating policies for risk management, financial assistance, research and development, resource management, and education and training. What the Government clearly recognises is that the urgency of the rural crisis is being responded to, but it is not without some historic parallels. As a government, it sees that there is a need for a coordinated and far-sighted approach which responds to urgent current needs while looking to the future and certainly reducing the chances of such crises recurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do feel, from the comments made by the honourable member for Dawson so far, that probably what he is suggesting is that he would like a rural policy which is based a little bit on a kick to kick approach rather than on an approach which is looking towards the long-term future. This Government clearly recognises that that is the way to go. As part of the Government's response to the rural crisis, income equalisation deposits have been designed to provide tax linked incentives for primary producers. These will allow them to build financial reserves for use during downturns, including farm management bonds which have been introduced specifically for use during periods of hardship due to natural or market events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances at the moment are certainly a combination of both natural and market events. Neither of those are situations which we can control, but it is imperative that we are able to put in place the packages of assistance which enable farmers not just to be begrudgingly dependent on government assistance all the time but to be able to put in place a situation where they can, with dignity, provide for their future and allow for those exceptional circumstances which are beyond the control of either governments or farmers themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmers I have met with want this sort of support and the National Farmers Federation does not want a short-sighted welfare approach to the rural crisis. The primary producers that I have spoken to certainly want assistance like that offered through the tax concessions for things like land care programs that reduce the effect of recurrent prolonged drought and reduce the impact of any sort of drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the honourable member for Dawson. He made comments to the effect that we need to provide packages which will take care of natural disasters&mdash;I think that is how he referred to them&mdash;because they are so recurrent and so prolonged in Australia. We have to have in place things such as the IEDs, which enable farmers to provide for the occurrence of drought because it is so much a part of the farming scene in the north of Queensland, mid-Queensland and even in the southern parts of Australia. I notice that just recently assistance has had to be provided in parts of South Australia for the very opposite&mdash;the damaging effects of too much rain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Primary producers also want the national property management planning campaign to get under way. It aims to improve the skills of land-holders in elements of property and financial risk planning. The rural business development programs provide help to rural communities to improve marketing and business skills. A range of programs help the whole community. They encourage innovative ideas and international competitiveness. They do not seek to cocoon&mdash;if I may use that term&mdash;our regional and rural communities. Despite what the honourable member for Dawson seems to believe, these communities want opportunities and incentives to actively turn around their current circumstances and to move into the future positively and with confidence of success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the examples of this far-sightedness that I would put to the House is the telecentre program. One of these operates in my electorate and it gives the community access to computer skills training and to modern communications developments that are essential for a business to become competitive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think there is any need for me to bring to the House's attention the serious plight facing rural producers and the people dependent on them. Many farmers are experiencing the toughest time since they started on the land, whether they be in their 50s, 60s, 70s or even 80s, which some of them are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Low commodity prices have been exacerbated by record high interest rates and, while the Government takes credit for today's lower interest rates, they are still amongst the highest comparable interest rates in the world. However, the aftershocks of the Government's previous scorched earth policy of record high interest rates are still being felt by farmers, many of whom have had to leave the land because of that policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that they have the falling commodity prices, particularly in the wool industry, in the citrus industry in my electorate, and in a number of other industries. On top of that again, there is drought in western Queensland and in northern New South Wales. This has badly affected the rural sector, and we will find it affecting the economy of this nation. The Government, although it has a massive Budget deficit, will find that the deficit will get even worse, particularly because of the problems we are facing in our rural sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to see the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) visit Queensland. He would know now just how serious drought can be. I hope that he will bring back to his Government the message that severe drought is indeed a natural disaster and that it is not only farmers who lose out in time of drought; as I said before, it is the entire Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics&mdash;a part of the Minister's own portfolio&mdash;in its September quarterly forecast told us that, on average, farm businesses in Australia will lose $26,000 in 1992-93; the figure for last year was a loss of $29,000; and the year before it was $24,000. This means that an average farmer loses $79,000 in a three-year period, and I believe that in the wool industry the loss is even worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things we have to look at&mdash;and this is what this motion is all about&mdash;is the assets test as applied to farmers and farming families. The assets test cannot be applied in the same way as it is to other situations. The Government's removal of the assets test for farm household support is to be welcomed, but it must go further in assisting farming families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many, if not most, farmers are asset rich and income poor. Assets are virtually worthless unless they are producing an income. The notion that farmers should sell up and leave and turn their assets into liquidity is ludicrous, given that farm property values are extremely low. The extremely depressed rural property market would work against people trying to sell their properties, even if they wanted to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers are in a catch-22 situation: they cannot afford to work the farm and they cannot afford to leave it. Many farmers in my electorate of Riverina are above the average age of 57, which in itself is an indictment of the fact that young people cannot afford a farm. So the older farmers keep going because they cannot leave the farm, and young people cannot afford to go onto a farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember going to a small property in the irrigation area, where I had a friend of Italian heritage. He was very upset, talking to me in tears because his son had come home. He had been educated and, as we know, the Italian heritage is that they work hard for their families so that they can give them something. The young man said, `Dad, I am educated now. I hope you are not working from daylight until dark for me, because there is no way I am taking on this lifestyle to make a living. I do not want to have to put up with drought and with the costs that are added on to me. I am going to work for the Government'. So he is working for the Government and his father is devastated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government must seriously consider the coalition's policy of abolishing the assets test on pensions for those farmers wishing to retire on the family farm. I know of one gentleman from my electorate, aged 75, who cannot retire because he cannot get a pension to live on. He cannot sell the farm, as I said before, because the values have dropped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Austudy assets test must also be removed for those families in rural areas who are undergoing economic hardship. It is very difficult in these times for those people to educate their children. The Government should also consider abolishing the assets test on a range of other benefits, including all rural education allowances. We have a problem in the bush. The Government must look at the assets test because the situation is different for those on the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn finally to income equalisation deposits. They should be an important method of stabilising farm incomes through drought, floods, crop failure and falls in commodity prices. If we had the old IED scheme that was introduced by the coalition, in particular by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), we would have had farmers in a much better situation today to face these high interest rates, drought and the fall in commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the motion which calls for the Government to act on these matters as a matter of urgency and ask for a deeper empathy with the plight of rural people in these harsh times.

There can be no doubt that there is extreme hardship being suffered by many of those people and families in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion for the acknowledgment of that hardship by this House should be recognised. I have been to some of those areas and there is ample evidence that hardship exists. But even in areas where the drought has not been so severe, many are having a difficult time because of the low world commodity prices and the effects of the rural recession. It is especially so for woolgrowers, as some of them have struggled through the last three or four years with continuing drought, low prices, recession and earlier high interest rates. Some of them have had all of those things at the same time. The hardship has been extremely severe. The Government does recognise that and acknowledges those difficulties. On 11 May, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) stated that he acknowledged the major problems facing rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been doing, and is doing, more than just expressing concern at these problems. We have allocated additional funding for the RAS&mdash;an extra $150 million in the last two years. We have introduced the exceptional circumstances provisions of around $50 million to deal with the long-term drought and to assist woolgrowers. We have allowed special access to the Job Search allowance for farmers. We have increased the RAS exit grant to $45,000; we have extended the farm household scheme; we have given additional support for the education of isolated children; we have given additional allowances under Austudy; and we have attempted to work with the banks to improve the deals that they get for farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have done those things, but that is not to say that more should not be done and that we should not be looking at other things&mdash;perhaps some of the things that the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) mentions in his motion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in view of Australia's intractable high unemployment and high current account deficit, this House urges the Government to establish a National Commission of Inquiry on the Economy to report within a year on the new policies required to simultaneously rapidly increase employment and reduce the current account deficit while maintaining low inflation, improving equity and ensuring environmental security.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia is at a watershed. We have two intractable economic problems which the policies of the 1980s have failed to resolve: high unemployment and a high current account deficit. As well, the policies of the 1980s have increased inequity, through the growth of high income and of the wealth and power of a relatively small proportion of the population. The quality and accessibility of some important community services have been reduced by cuts in government spending, and a serious aftermath of the excesses of private entrepreneurs during the 1980s has been a loss of confidence in the probity, ethics and judgment of the Australian business community, both here and internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet there were also demonstrable benefits from the policies of the 1980s which now provide a firm basis for a refocused economic strategy. Firstly, Australia's inflation rate of about one per cent is amongst the lowest in Western countries, and continues here at the lowest level it has been for several decades. Secondly, Australia's public debt is amongst the lowest of comparable countries, a fact which is not recognised by many economic analysts. Thirdly, an economic recovery is under way. Australia is expecting to grow faster than all but a couple of Western countries during 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other achievements during the last decade have included the remarkable growth in public sector productivity of over four per cent a year, which the Opposition often does not recognise; the efficiency of the social security system in targeting deprivation; and the exploding interest in education and training in schools, institutes of technology and universities. These achievements are, in part, the obverse side of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, a central issue remains, which is that many of the Government's economic advisers have been preoccupied with reducing inflation rather than unemployment and with improving efficiency rather than equity. For example, many economists perceive a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Although both are regarded as problems, many economists would argue that achieving and maintaining low inflation should have a priority. `Inflation first' is their slogan. A low inflation rate is certainly desirable, for it increases Australia's international competitiveness and improves economic security. Yet moderate inflation and unemployment are hardly equivalent evils. Inflation is only about the value of money, yet unemployment marginalises and stigmatises people, destroying their economic security and their self-respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many economists, particularly monetarists, solemnly talked during the 1980s about the `natural rate of unemployment'&mdash;one of the most vicious euphemisms ever coined, as the past president of the Economic Associations of America wrote recently. Our own Treasury has used the inhuman term `over-full employment' meaning that while there was still unemployment inflationary pressure was increasing. Such word games demonstrate the dehumanisation of much economic analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way out of this conflict is to emphasise the twin goals of reduction of both unemployment and inflation. It is not beyond the wit of competent economists to design policies which simultaneously increase employment and reduce inflation. That is the main goal of the accord, which has contributed directly and effectively to achieving both goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's circumstances require that economic policy be refocused. There has been a strong public reaction against the misjudgments of the economic fundamentalists. There is a widespread hunger for a balanced approach which would offer realistic hope of growth of employment and equity, as well as of low inflation and improving efficiency, of environmental responsibility as well as of economic development. The Government is firmly committed to those complex goals and it must therefore be prepared to seek policies which would include more active intervention. In that context there would be great value in a national commission of inquiry into the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of such an inquiry could well be a statement akin to the 1945 white paper on full employment, but the process of preparation would be vital to the effectiveness of the outcome. An internal Public Service review would be inadequate, because much the same people who advised on the policies of the 1980s would prepare the papers. The Vernon committee or the Coombs royal commission would provide much better models because they involved commissioners with a wide range of experience drawn from all major parts of the economy. That is a somewhat different approach from that envisaged by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, though the rationale is similar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A five-person commission would be appropriate, drawn from business, unions, academia, the Public Service and other community groups. Such an inquiry could be established immediately. The commission could be given a year to report and the support of a secretariat of about 20 professional officers. The terms of reference for the commission should begin with the Government's commitment to full employment and lower inflation, to improving equity and efficiency and to environmental security as well as economic development, and include references to each of the areas of policy and practice which make an impact on economic activity and employment: fiscal, monetary and incomes policy, the international economy, industry policy, education, training and immigration, industry structure, work and employment practices, labour market programs, income support and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inquiries sometimes cause cynicism among people who say, `The Government is only deferring the problems'. The point is, however, that there are no panaceas for resolving our intractable economic problems. No-one on either side of this House, or in any part of the community, has the whole answer. Hundreds of new minor and major policy and program initiatives and changes in business and union practice are required, and that was recognised by the Government in the Governor-General's speech when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we also acknowledge that new policies and practices may have to be developed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is certainly true. Without new policies and practices we will still have high unemployment by the end of the decade. Both new processes of policy formation and new approaches are necessary. In this situation, a broad based inquiry, drawing on the most rigorous intellectual analysis and empirical research by able people, committed to the goals of full employment as well as to the goals of lower inflation and to improving equity as well as efficiency, could make a major contribution to effectively redirecting Australian economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Government should not wait until the report of this commission is received before taking  initiatives. Fresh additional policies are required immediately. I will conclude by suggesting a couple. In October 1991, I tabled a parliamentary report on Australia's current account deficit and overseas debt and, in July last year, I released a report of an employment task force entitled `Maximising employment'. Some of the proposals in those reports have already been implemented, including fiscal stimulus, a new job creation scheme operating on local infrastructure, a fall in interest rates and the exchange rate, and the expansion of targeted training programs for young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other proposals are still relevant. For example, there is scope for a further expansion of public outlays targeted in ways which would increase national productivity, output and exports. These include areas such as infrastructure, education and training, research and development, structural adjustment and international marketing assistance. Further increases in funding for institutes of technology, universities and schools, for railways, roads and ports, as well as for hospitals and public housing would serve the double purpose of improving the efficiency of the national infrastructure and of improving skills in human wellbeing as well as stimulating economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Income restraint should be maintained and extended to non-wage incomes through implementation of the strength and competition policy and by using progressive tax policies. An active industry based policy should be developed to promote exports and import replacement with emphasis on regional userproducer links. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other possibilities are appropriate but to summarise: the central requirements for addressing unemployment and the current account deficit are a more balanced approach to both ends and means. This would allow a more active role for the Government free of the artificial ideological constraints of the 1980s. Our society will be more secure and attractive if it is also more equitable and humane.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, I will not be able to support the motion of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). It must be said that I do support his objectives of low inflation and high levels of employment or conversely low levels of unemployment. There is no question that, in a historical context, we need to once again return Australia to those halcyon days of the past when we lived in a time of low inflation and virtually no unemployment whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, instead of another commission or another inquiry, basically we know what needs to be done. We know what needs to be done and yet this Government&mdash;those on the Government side of this place&mdash;lack the political will to get on with the job. While he talks in very positive context about the so-called benefits of the accord, I remind the honourable member for Fraser that this stitched-up deal between a Labor government and the trade unions in Australia has really brought undone the basis of our whole economy. This is the first thing that needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to the Government's credit&mdash;and I have said this on many occasions&mdash;and the credit of the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that when he was Treasurer he did help us to deregulate the banks and to deregulate the dollar so that our dollar now floats in an international context. But in a historical context Australia grew up with great wealth generated out of our mines and on our farms&mdash;off the backs of the sheep, if you will. In order to try to diversify our exports, diversify what Australians did, we then used that income to build a huge wall of protection around our country. That wall of protection not only cost Australians dearly, as we now know, but also set in train a set of attitudes and a whole set of formalised systems&mdash;including, notably, our industrial relations system being highly centralised and highly cosseted as it is. So for year after year after year we increased protection for industry because the unions said they needed a wage increase, and then we increased wages because we had increased the cost to Australians of the products that we had so protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we are caught in this time warp where we know what needs to be done. We know that we need to deregulate the labour market as we have deregulated the financial market. We know that Australian industry, in order to be competitive, has got to be released from the constraints of centralism and released from the constraints of the union bureaucracy determining, in the largest sense, how people work, what they are paid and how they participate in the working life of our economy. I have no doubt that if we truly deregulate our labour market, if we attack some of our real infrastructure problems&mdash;like the cost of electricity supply, the cost of water and the cost of transport both on land and, significantly, at sea&mdash;if we allow our industry to be competitive and if at the same time we offer industry some encouragement to invest in productive capacity, then perhaps once again we will start to build the industry infrastructure which today we know is falling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investment in new productive capacity is falling, and that means that this recovery which the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) says is emerging may not in fact emerge at all. I fear that as we further eliminate tariffs, without allowing industry some advantage on the other side for giving up this protection, we will in fact lose more and more industry, some of it to bankruptcies and some of it overseas. We will never solve the problem of low inflation and high employment until we have productive enterprise. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate that the previous speaker, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), took such a narrow and simplistic view on the Australian economy. The conclusion from his position is that the way to solve the problem is to reduce Australian wages. That is basically what he is talking about, turning us into not a low wage country but an ultra low wage country. Unfortunately, he has missed the richness of this motion before the House. What the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) has put forward is a matter of extreme substance, not some trivial, simplistic notion that you can solve our economic problems easily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To understand its depth, one really has to go back over time and look at what has been happening in Australia in the sense that we, with the rest of the world, have moved slowly. Things have changed slowly, and one can go back and measure those changes over hundreds of years and see minor changes in language, in technology, in science and medicine. But in the last 30 years there has been a dramatic change in the rate of change and the whole world has suddenly started to learn much faster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a massive change in production technology. It took us thousands of years to develop production lines like the Ford production line. It has taken us virtually decades to automate those lines. The development of computers took 50 years to get to transistors and five to 10 years to get to integrated circuits. The miniaturisation, computerisation and automation of our means of production is transforming the fabric of modern economies so fast that most people do not see what is happening and cannot see the results. It is transforming so fast that we can no longer measure it and, because we cannot measure it, we cannot predict it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time ago a parliamentary inquiry took evidence from representatives of the Bureau of Statistics about how they measure investment. It transpired that leasing by businesses is not regarded as investment. So all those companies that are leasing equipment are not investing because leasing is part of finance; it is not part of investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national accounts figures are a good example. That famous and historic occasion in December 1991 when the national accounts figures for September were negative had an enormous effect on how businesses and the community perceived that Australia was going. People made a lot of decisions based on those figures. Three months later those figures were revised to become positive. In other words, in reporting on the September quarter the Bureau of Statistics had made a report which was in fact wrong, and that was corrected four months later. So until those corrections were made, people were making judgments about what to do, and they were making the wrong judgments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to transform dramatically our capacity to understand our economy. We drastically need to transform our capacity to predict our economy. When things change slowly it is easy to predict. When things change quickly it is hard to predict. We are using instruments of prediction and analysis which date back to 20 years ago. Those instruments were terrific for understanding our economy 20 years ago. The danger is that in 20 years time we will have instruments that predict today's economy very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless we understand that and understand the methodologies, we will be trapped in a situation where we have very little control over our future. The fact is that predictions can be self-fulfilling. If we say we are in recession, and we tell the whole world we are in recession, and we tell ourselves we are in recession, then to some degree we automatically are in recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not just apply to Australia. At the beginning of last year in America and Europe President George Bush and Prime Minister John Major were being given similar advice about their economies. I was in Europe early last year. I talked to French parliamentarians and French bureaucrats about their advice, and the advice they were getting was very similar to the advice we were being given in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The grievance that I wish to put before the House today is one that has been raised, at least in part, by me earlier this week. I wish to place on the record, very briefly, that the subject about which I am going to speak was raised in a spurious way in the Queensland Parliament yesterday by the Queensland State Treasurer. I state to the House that I do not intend to respond at the moment to Mr de Lacy's allegations. I am hoping that I shall get the opportunity when 90-second statements occur later today to make a statement in response to the allegations Mr de Lacy made about me yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, at this stage Mr De Lacy and his views are only a sideshow. The central issue is one of national security. On Monday I asked a question of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) relating to the activities of a Japanese crime boss in Australia. The Prime Minister made an undertaking which I shall refer to in a few minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Bolkus, as the Minister representing the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), had this matter raised by way of a question to him from a Queensland senator. In reply, amongst other things, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Justice has sought advice from the commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in respect of this issue. As a consequence of that advice, I am advised that the AFP has in fact been monitoring Japanese organised crime trends and activities for a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on in his reply, when responding as the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, he made the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been media speculation in recent days, particularly in Queensland. That speculation has named specific persons. . . I have asked my department, the immigration department, to investigate the allegations as they affect immigration laws.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday's attempt in the Senate by the Minister to answer my question to the Prime Minister and to draw away some of the attention being paid to this subject has raised far more questions than it answered. It now transpires, according to information in the Minister's answer, that the Japanese crime boss whom I referred to earlier this week holds a multiple entry visa. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That visa, I am informed, was issued at a time when he had no criminal record.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, when his department gave him that advice it was hoping that the Minister had not read my speech, because it outlined how it could happen that a criminal from Japan would not appear to have a criminal record, at least, not before March of this year, which was when the relevant Japanese law was changed. The facts are that Masaru Takumi has twice been issued with a multiple entry visa into Australia. One was issued for four years in 1987. His present visa was issued for four years in 1991&mdash;it is obviously a renewal of the 1987 visa&mdash;and does not expire until December 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presumably this is a multiple entry business visa, although the Minister did not actually say that in his answer. So for the last six years one of the world's leading crime figures has held a multiple entry visa for Australia and has travelled here at will under that visa. Presumably, six years ago he made claims as to having certain business interests in this country. We must be urgently told what those claims were. What are Mr Takumi's business interests in Australia? Time does not permit me to reiterate the sorts of business interests that his branch of the Yakuza&mdash;the Yamaguchi-Gumi gang&mdash;pursues, but there are thousands of seemingly legitimate businesses operated by his gang. How many of them is he pursuing here in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made reference to the fact that the home that Takumi has bought on the Gold Coast, in my electorate, was purchased by a business called Takumi Enterprises Pty Ltd. He remarried in June 1991, I note for the record. The two shareholders in this company are he and the woman he married in June 1991. If he received a business visa in 1987&mdash;that is, before he married this co-shareholder&mdash;what other businesses, besides Takumi Enterprises Pty Ltd, does this man have in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must urgently have all this information put before us, and it is the business of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to be seeking that information. It is not just a matter for the Minister for Justice with his responsibility for the Australian Federal Police. It is not just the business of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, with his responsibility for issuing visas. It is also very much the responsibility of the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that the reason, however, that I directed last Monday's question to the Prime Minister, calling on him to answer the allegations about Takumi, is that this is a matter of utmost urgency, with implications for Australia's national security. It relates not only to the general question of the administration of government in Australia across several portfolios but also specifically to the central role of the Australian Federal Police and its responsibilities for protecting our security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it very poor indeed that yesterday&mdash;five days after the front page <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> article made its allegations about Masaru Takumi&mdash;the best the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs could say is that he has called for a report, and that he could only give us sketchy, basic information. He should have urgently been seeking it after Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> story, not after I raised the matter here on Monday. Even so, two days after my question and my speech, he still does not have anything to tell us. I reiterate here an extract from Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal Police yesterday&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, last Friday, 7 May 1993&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">confirmed they were aware of Takumi's penthouse purchase and his frequent visits to the Gold Coast but would not comment further.</PARA>
<PARA>The article then quotes the federal police:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The Australian Federal Police does not talk about its intelligence activities in relation to the Yakuza or any ethnic organised crime group which may or may not be operating in Australia', a spokesman said.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an official statement from the Australian Federal Police, presumably following on from the other comments of confirmation that had been made. It is confirmation that the AFP has been aware of the activities of this man on the Gold Coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask two central questions. If the Australian Federal Police was aware of his activities, why did it not inform the department of immigration earlier? If it did, why was this man's visa not cancelled forthwith? Why is it today still valid? Why is it that he could be arriving at any of our international airports today and be allowed through immigration with impunity, with a right to be here? What is happening in the administration of the security of this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn very briefly to the matter of the Foreign Investment Review Board, because I have only a short time left to speak on this matter. The Treasurer, as I said, must make a full statement about the FIRB approval of Takumi's property purchase. I cannot repeat here the grounds available for approval of purchase of private property by a foreign national, but they are all listed in my speech of Monday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now it appears that this man has had business activities here since 1987. Not only has the Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Department not done anything about his visa for six years, but the Foreign Investment Review Board also has had a potential involvement for the past six years. What checks has FIRB made on the actual business activities of this man? What information can it give us, through the Treasurer&mdash;and hopefully also through the Prime Minister&mdash;about what his activities have been? What has he claimed? Does he claim business activities other than Takumi Enterprises Pty Ltd? What are all of his companies' activities in this country, if in fact he has more than one company? Whether it is one or more, we must be told in this place the names of the directors of all of those companies, because we are informed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> article that there is an Australian involvement in Takumi Enterprises Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same questions must be asked of the AFP as must be asked of the FIRB. Why have Takumi's activities not been  reported to relevant government authorities? Whilst, as I said, Mr de Lacy has attempted to draw attention to himself, what is really central to this matter is the role of the Australian Federal Police. In theory, critical information should have been flowing from it to all these other government departments. If it has, why has action not been taken in those departments? If it has not flowed, we must know with great urgency the reasons and the facts behind that non-flow of information about one of the world's leading criminals and his activities in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to continue some remarks I have been making about aspects of superannuation policy which now come under my area of responsibility in the Government. However, first I want to pick up and counter some criticisms by the Opposition relating to some recent speeches I have made on the question of superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a perception in the coalition parties that the benefits accruing to workers under the superannuation guarantee system will not be enough to fund a decent standard of living for Australians in retirement. The conventional wisdom on that right now is that, yes, contributions of only three to five per cent of wages are not sufficient to build up a decent nest egg. But honourable members need to remember that under our system employer contributions are set to rise, over the next few years, from that level to nine per cent of employee ordinary time earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, everyone knows that the current contributions are not sufficient, but what we have done through our policy is to set in legislation the rate at which the contributions will rise and become sufficient. What the Government has not done&mdash;and what our opponents apparently would like to do&mdash;is subject our retirement incomes policy to the vagaries of the Opposition's industrial relations policy, which is pretty much a dog-eat-dog situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has also, of course, relied on the notion of a faulty system of incentives that are meant to induce Australians to put away for their own retirement, a system which we well know, and the superannuation industry knows, would simply be insufficient; people would not put away and make sufficient provision for their own retirement. It is important that we have a schedule whereby we raise the rate of contributions over a number of years to a level which we all agree is sufficient for a decent income in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know, and so should our opponents, that when we introduce a scheme with such importance as the superannuation guarantee we need to make gradual changes. That is why the contribution rates will rise over a considerable number of years. We know that contribution rates must be in the vicinity of about 12 per cent of average weekly earnings, but we have ensured that we do not make that levy all at one time on the business community: we have already announced that we will reach that percentage by the end of the century. The contributions from employers will reach nine per cent and then the question of a three per cent contribution on the part of employees will have to be raised and no doubt will be worked through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was reading in a recent article by David Wise some interesting trends and facts about the American retirement income scenario. He noted that 64 million people in the United States work in almost two-thirds of all commercial organisations which do not offer any kind of superannuation contributions. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the majority of these workers, the social security system is the only hope for succour and security in their retirement years.</PARA>
<PARA>Interestingly, for the job growth that Australia will experience in the next few years, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trends in the economy towards job-creation by smaller firms which are outside of the collective bargaining system will only exacerbate the current decline in private pension fund coverage.</PARA>
<PARA>All honourable members should breathe a collective sigh of relief that Australia has such a well-developed and mature retirement incomes policy. One only has to look at the open hostility of the small business community and basically the employer groups to the advent of both award based superannuation and the superannuation guarantee charge scheme to guess where we would now be if a Liberal government had been elected in March this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other refrain that we hear often involves the effect of excessive fees and charges being levied against those taking out superannuation. I am happy to say and to announce today that the fees, charges, commissions and their disclosures, both in life insurance and superannuation products, will be one of my priorities in my period as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just recently one of the honourable members opposite suggested that these fees were a substantial drain on retirement savings. I might say to that person in reply that rather than throw up my hands and suggest that this is too difficult an area to tackle, what I will be proposing is that we will not allow high transaction fees to frustrate government policy in this area. To that end I look forward to the challenge of creating a situation where by careful scrutiny by the Government and by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and by the forces of competition that we can enhance in the market, the cost of private superannuation will be forced down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that earlier this year Senator Sherry, the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, tabled some documents showing the growth in industry funds prior to the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy. I would hope soon to be able to table some more up to date figures on the growth of low cost industry funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might now turn to another subject that I have an interest in, national accounting for resource depletion. I have an interest in that for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the Australian Bureau of Statistics comes within my purview as Parliamentary Secretary. Secondly, as an old geographer I have kept up an interest in environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with interest the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 29 April where the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Ros Kelly) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia should consider including environmental damage and the depletion of national resources in its calculations of national income.</PARA>
<PARA>This follows from similar moves that are now occurring in the United States. Support for such moves comes from the Vice-President of the United States, Al Gore, who wrote in October 1992 when he was still Senator Gore, that he noted that the man-delivered impacts on the environment were not adequately factored into the decision making equation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bad things economists want to ignore while they measure the good things are often said to be too difficult to integrate into their calculations. . . . The bad things are simply defined away as external to the process and called externalities. This habit of using an arbitrary definition to exclude inconvenient facts from the calculation of what is good and what is bad is a form of dishonesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of the noted American Robert Repetto of the World Resources Institute in Washington DC is enlightening here. He notes that both classical and Keynesian economists are caught up in measuring factors like consumption and savings and investment and so on and he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difference in treatment of natural resources and other tangible assets provides false signals to both economists and politicians. It reinforces a false dichotomy between the economy and the environment that leads them to ignore or destroy the latter in the name of development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These developments have already excited the curiosity of some Australians and to this end I note the work of Mr Young of the CSIRO in Canberra. In May 1991 Mr Young extrapolated the Repetto approach to the Australian landscape and did some work on a conceptual framework for accountants that describes the costs and benefits of agricultural land use in the Murray-Darling Basin. I note that he also has completed some work at a macro level looking at renewable resource depletion and the valuation of mineral stocks and their effect on the GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention these points because the issue has now been raised by Mrs Kelly. I seek to have discussions with the ABS and Mrs Kelly on the question. I think it is a very difficult one even to conceptualise, but it is one that we have to think about. We have to have the ABS do some work on it and see if we cannot incorporate these measures of natural resource depletion as part of our national accounting system. </PARA>

<PARA>The Verwayen judgment supposedly means that the Commonwealth, as an employer of people paid to defend the country, cannot claim exemption from civil compensation if they come to harm in the course of their natural or normal duties, the so-called combat defence. This is not only an important precedent but also is a simple reflection of elementary justice, albeit achieved for Mr Verwayen only after a tortuous confrontation with the Commonwealth. </PARA>

Since 1986, Ministers have relied on legalistic jingoism in each individual case. Squirm as they may about their rationale, Ministers know that the bottom line for the Commonwealth is a total compensation bill of about $30 million. In other words, unnecessary and costly legal argument has been used to cloud the real issue of reluctance to satisfy such a substantial budgetary outlay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the Attorney-General in particular to page 45 of Mr Justice Coldrey's 1992 judgment in one of these cases, the Clark case, where he said in part:</PARA>

The 1992 book about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> sinking by the historian Tom Frame, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Where Fate Calls</EMPHASIS>, should be a salutary reminder to the people of Australia, to the Royal Australian Navy, to Federal governments of all party political hues and to this Government in particular. No-one wants a witch-hunt after 30 years. However, it remains a national tragedy that the public at large and the families of the 82 men who died may never have the undisputed truth.

I am hopeful that his Cabinet advisings earlier this week and today's change of legal tack by the Government will provide substantive early results for the survivors, ensuring that those who perished nearly 30 years ago will at long last rest in peace and that those who survived can pick up the shattered remnants of their lives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the grievance debate to inform the House about an issue that has been a particular concern in my electorate over the last few weeks; that is, the health of my community. The Governor-General mentioned in his address to the Parliament last week that our Government plans to work with State governments and the private sector to achieve efficiency gains and better access to health services while reducing waiting lists in main surgical areas. This to me was extremely encouraging news.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am very disturbed that I received a letter from a constituent recently whose 19-year-old son has had a distressing experience with our health system in New South Wales. His access to local health services was impaired, to say the least. My constituent stated to me that her son had been experiencing very high fevers, vomiting and severe headaches for over a week. He was told on three separate occasions by doctors coming to the home to treat him during that time that he had glandular fever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the end of that week of treatment he was so ill and his mother become so frustrated that she immediately put him in her car and rushed him to Westmead Hospital, which, I might add, is a major teaching hospital in the western region of Sydney. There she was told that there was something like a three-hour waiting period in casualty. She appealed to the sister in charge,`He is very ill. Could he at least lie down?'. She said, `No, you will have to wait your turn'. She was then questioned about her address; when my constituent said she lived in Yennora, which is part of my electorate, she was asked by the sister on duty why she did not go to the smaller local hospital at Fairfield, which the sister said was closer, and told that she should not have brought her son to Westmead in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly shocked to read about this because I have always believed that it is the right of all people to be able to go to any public hospital for emergency assistance, no matter where they live. I might add that, geographically, that person lives a lot closer to Westmead Hospital than Fairfield Hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituent's son was deteriorating rapidly and, rather than take him straight to Fairfield Hospital, she drove to a medical centre in Merrylands which was much closer. The doctors there were extremely concerned about the treatment Westmead Hospital had given my constituent's son because they were sure he had meningitis. The doctors at the medical centre then organised immediate transfer for the son to Fairfield Hospital. Doctors at Fairfield Hospital agreed that he may have meningitis and they decided that he would have to go&mdash;wait for it!&mdash;back to Westmead Hospital, or to Liverpool Hospital, for further tests. By this stage my constituent was so distressed by her son's illness and treatment and the condition he was then in that she said, `We will not go to Westmead'. So the hospital then sent him to Liverpool Hospital for further tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tests confirmed that her son did have viral meningitis, which is an extremely serious disease that affects the brain. I have requested a full investigation, on behalf of my constituent, of her experience at Westmead Hospital. I should state that Westmead is a teaching hospital which I have always been very proud of since relocating in the western region of Sydney. I hope that the result of the investigation will prevail upon all concerned so that we do not see a recurrence of what I believe has been a dreadful situation for my constituent to bear. Her son, I might add, has been left with permanent damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, meningitis is a disease which is increasing in incidence within our community. Young children are particularly susceptible to it. The symptoms progress very quickly and, over a period of hours, a child's health can deteriorate so rapidly that it is vital for that child to be immediately hospitalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bacterial meningitis, as opposed to the viral meningitis which my 19-year-old constituent was diagnosed with, is commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B, or HIB, which is a strain of the influenza virus which is now affecting around 700 Australian children each year, with some 10 to 20 of those affected children dying from the disease, and a similar number now suffering from permanent long-term scarring. The peak incidence of the disease is in children between the ages of six and 12 months, and about 40 per cent of those cases now occur in children before the age of 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government, I am very pleased to hear, has announced that a special interim arrangement has now been put in place to allow parents of eligible children to claim a refund on any expenditure they may have had in recent months with regard to the HIB vaccine. There are currently four vaccines approved for use in Australia, but only one is approved for use in children over 18 months. The other three are administered when the children are two, four and 12 months old for the three-dose vaccine, and two, four, six and 18 months old for the four-dose vaccine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parents of babies born on or after 1 February 1993, who have purchased that vaccine on or after 1 April 1993, will be eligible, I am pleased to say, for reimbursement of up to $35.50 per dose of the HIB vaccine provided by a pharmacist, medical practitioner or the local council. Proof of purchase will be required, including the name of vaccine and the date on which it was bought, as well as a declaration of out-of-pocket expenses that will also be required to obtain that refund. Parents can now make that claim through their local Medicare office, and special HIB claim forms have now been made available at these offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national HIB immunisation program was agreed as a cooperative program between the Commonwealth and the States in 1992. Under that arrangement, the Commonwealth will now supply the vaccine to the States following a national tender which, fortunately, closes in mid-May. The full program will commence on 1 July 1993. The Commonwealth Government will provide the funds to the States and the Territories so that that precious vaccine can be made available to our medical practitioners and, in particular, to our immunisation clinics at no cost to parents of eligible children from that date.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HIB vaccine is the first significant addition to the routine immunisation schedule since the measles vaccine in 1968. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national program itself aims to vaccinate all children at two months, and several times thereafter, as this has been shown to be the most effective time for vaccination to take place. Older children, much to the concern of some of my constituents, will not be eligible for the funded program, but I am pleased that they will at least have the ability to purchase the vaccine. The health of our community is vital as we are all well aware. Babies are so precious to us all. Our children are our future and I believe that we must do all we can to protect them from illnesses such as meningitis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend our Federal Government on its moves to make the HIB vaccine readily and freely available to parents for their children. I believe this will not only contribute to the general health and to the wellbeing of our society but it will also get the message across to the community at large that we must now take further steps to protect our children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently in my electorate, we have had cases of mothers who did not know that something like this existed. They originally thought that their child was having a reaction to flu or was sick or teething. I believe that, with this awareness and with the immunisation program that is now in place, we will go a long way to avoiding what has been a tragic loss of life which we now know was avoidable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most particularly, I am very concerned to receive reports, in a community such as mine, of the calibre of treatment from a major teaching hospital like Westmead&mdash;that it could be put in the circumstance where many seriously ill constituents of mine are being placed at a disadvantage. Our community at all times should have the right to emergency treatment, no matter where they go in the public health system. I hope the representations that I have made, on behalf of my constituents, will see the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) fully investigating this particular matter. I believe that in so doing we could prevent in the future an occurrence like this affecting other constituents in other electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased to commend to the community the availability of a vaccine that has taken a number of years to bring to this country. I plead with many mothers&mdash;who have for some time ignored the right of having their children vaccinated&mdash;to heed the advice that has now been proven. The only preventive way is to have children vaccinated and to have them done at a very early age with a preference to start the first vaccine, in the multi-vaccine inoculation, at two months of age. I know that many people are saying, `My child has been all right. Why should I now have a second one vaccinated?'. It is not the case; the disease is there. There is a preventive measure which they can take. The cost is no longer the cause for not taking that preventive measure. I appeal to all parents throughout Australia to make it available to their children at a very early age. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure there are many honourable members in this House who wish pay television had never been invented. The Government has presided over one big stuff-up that shows no signs of abating. What interests me is the access of pay television to regional and rural Australia&mdash;the forgotten land under this Government. How can regional development seriously proceed in this country when our remote regions are 80 years behind the technological eight ball.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not allow this Labor Government repeat this disgraceful record with pay television. In order to decentralise our closely knit coastal population, effective communications, transport and education facilities must be available in regional areas. Our country regions have great things to offer major metropolitan centres, including a better quality of life, close community associations, lower cost of living, a lower incidence of industrial disputation and a proximity to the nation's wealth&mdash;the land and its resources. However, these things do not stand on their own. They must be backed up with adequate provision of quality of life services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one will happily move from a city location to a region where television services are limited, where untimed local telephone calls are simply mythology, where access to education is restricted, and where public transport is non-existent. Regional development is more than just attracting businesses outside the capital cities. It requires a commitment from all levels of government and the provision of equitable levels of services. Pay television is no exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year during the debate on the Broadcasting Services Bill, an Opposition amendment was successfully carried to provide for as much of Australia as possible to access pay television. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has conveniently ignored this amendment. His comments during Question Time over the last two days illustrate that he is resigned to the fact that 10 per cent of Australian households will not access the Optus satellite high-performance beam and therefore will not receive pay television. He has stated categorically in Question Time that all but 10 per cent of the Australian population will receive pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in advocating the satellite technology and the Optus high-performance beam, the Prime Minister implied that rural Queensland and our provincial cities will access pay television. I have news for the Prime Minister. It is these very areas that represent the 10 per cent of households unable to access the high-performance beam. As a general rule of thumb, the high-performance beam will be accessible to those people living within 200 kilometres of the coast. This would rule out the centres of Wagga, Forbes and Junee, so proudly alluded to by the Prime Minister yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A rhetorical question posed by the Prime Minister during Question Time yesterday was: Who cares about Forbes and Junee and Wagga or rural Queensland, who cares about our great provincial cities?'. Obviously not this Prime Minister, and obviously not this Labor Government. The Prime Minister's gall to suggest that the National Party was not looking after its interests of regional and rural Australia is seen for the sham that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 10 per cent of Australian households the Prime Minister is willing to write off in the pay television debate is the 10 per cent of households already ignored by the Labor Government. Their access to community, cultural and sporting activities is already severely limited. In many cases, their current television viewing is restricted to two channels, a commercial network and the ABC. In effect, the Government's actions are widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots. What does the city have? It has 26-odd pay television channels, access to live theatrical and sporting activities, and various other services at people's fingertips. What does regional Australia have? Very little. And if this Government has its way, it will be a long time before regional Australia gets much more than it has today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of the amendment to provide for as much of Australia as possible to access pay television? I stress the word `possible'. It is indeed possible for 100 per cent of Australian households to access pay television. The licensee must simply draw from the national beam in addition to the high-performance beam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A simple calculation based on figures provided by Optus would suggest that the provision of four basic service channels on the high-performance beam will cost the licensee $8.6 million per year. To extend the coverage to include the national beam, and access all Australian households, would cost a further $4.4 million. If that were done, we would have a truly national pay television service. What the Government offers is not a national pay television service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has the further benefit of reducing the cost of bringing the free to air services to regional and rural Australia and would also lower the cost to government, because some of these free to air services today are subsidised by the Government. Given that we have established that it is possible for pay television to be provided to 100 per cent of Australian households, what action will the Government take to fulfil the amendment passed, to provide for as much of Australia as possible access to pay television? What provision will the Prime Minister make, in fact what provision will the Labor Party make, to those 10 per cent of households, including those located in Hobart, Darwin and Cairns, unable to access the high performance beam and therefore rendered incapable of receiving pay television?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party is clearly in a mess over this pay television debate. The Ministers involved have not handled it well, in fact they have been appalling, and the editorials confirm that comment. The Labor Party has forgotten rural Australians and regional Australians in this pay TV debate. Where regional and rural Australia counts, I challenge the Prime Minister on this issue to either put up or shut up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today relates to the hypocritical attitude of the Opposition in relation to the Government's proposal to treat shares differently as from September 1993 in calculating eligibility for pension purposes. This morning the shadow social security Minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), shed crocodile tears for social security recipients. He introduced a private member's Bill relating to the proposed treatment of shares and later moved a motion with respect to certain matters relating to the taxation system and the social security system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition originally supported the Bill when it was passed some time last year in both Houses. During the election campaign it said that, if elected to government, it would review it. Now, having lost the election, having been rejected by the Australian people, it seeks to find favour with those who will be affected by these new measures by playing politics with the issue. Those opposite know that in opposition they can say and do whatever they like. They do not have any responsibility to anyone but themselves, and what they are doing is spreading fear and panic amongst the pensioner community for the purpose of scoring cheap political points. It is easy for the honourable member for Berowra to stand at the dispatch box and with righteous indignation criticise the Government for its actions in this area. But would Opposition members have changed their minds on this issue had they found themselves in government after 13 March? Of course they would not have. There is no question about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to an article by Christine Wallace in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> a couple of days ago. It is headed, `Opposition pension Bill at odds with tough fiscal line'. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inconsistencies have begun to emerge in the fiscal purity of the Hewson Opposition which, while taking a hard line on cutting government spending to fix the Budget deficit, is pushing for a change to policy that could put spending up. The first private member's Bill introduced into the Senate by the Opposition has potential extra spending implications of up to $60 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move is at odds with the tough fiscal line coming from Opposition economic spokesmen, who have repeatedly criticised the Keating Government's $16 billion 1992-93 Budget deficit, urging Labor to cut spending to repair the deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition parties made it clear in Fightback that they would cut $1 billion from the social security budget. I put it to the House that there is no way that they would have changed these rules, which will save up to some $80 million in one year for an initial setting-up administrative cost of some $350,000. But what do they do? They play politics with the issue and as a result spread fear among our pensioner community as to what is going to happen, or what they consider is going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They join some financial planners who are making an issue in the pensioner community of the same issue, for obvious reasons. I quote from a good article from the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation newsletter, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Action Network</EMPHASIS> of May, 1993. It is by Gerard Thomas, who is their policy officer, and it is headed `Changes cause panic'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The share issue has received an unprecedented amount of publicity, causing anxiety around the country, even though it only affected less than five per cent of the total pensioner population.</PARA>
<PARA>Commenting on the publicity the issue has received in the popular press, Mr Thomas said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry groups, investment and retirement advisers have been lobbying heavily against the changes. This makes one suspicious and wary about the motives of these people who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA>Cautioning pensioners against making panic decisions to dispose of their shares, he urged them to receive financial advice before acting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is somebody who actually writes for the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation saying, `Do not be too concerned about it, because the fact is that you may not even be affected'. The reason that we are doing this is that it is simply another device to circumvent the income test provisions of the Social Security Act. The campaign being waged by the Opposition is similar to that waged when the assets test rules were introduced at some time in the early part of the Hawke-Keating governments, and is the same sort of campaign that was later initiated as a result of the deeming proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that, once they were understood, they were accepted. In the great majority of cases, people were not adversely affected. In the case of the deeming rules, not only were thousands of people not affected adversely, but they in fact ended up with more disposable income than they themselves were aware that they could have. Indeed, over the last couple of weeks, since there has been a lot of publicity about this new treatment of shares, I have received a number of phone calls at my office from pensioners who have been understandably concerned about some of the things said in the publicity. In every case except one, I think, they were not going to be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of managed investments, this is simply extending what we had done with respect to other types of shares, managed investments and that sort of thing. The policy was introduced in 1988, because many investors were using exempt capital growth to obtain good returns on their investments while avoiding the income test. Rather than use those returns to provide for their income needs in retirement, they were able to draw on the age pension to a greater extent than other people who received their returns in other forms, and were able to retain and increase their capital assets. This was clearly unfair. The change in the treatment of shares extends these rules, making the income test even fairer. There is no reason why people who invest directly in the share market should be treated differently from those who invest indirectly through equity-linked managed investments such as equity trusts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government would prefer not to have to take these measures, but sometimes tough decisions have to be made, and as a Government we have a responsibility to ensure that every dollar of the welfare budget is properly targeted. There is no bottomless well of money available to the Government. This measure is not about being unfair. It is not about discriminatory treatment of pensioners who happen to hold shares. What it is about is fairness and consistency in the way that we treat such investments. It is about equity; it is about proper targeting; it is about ensuring that the social security system is used as a needs based system&mdash;as a safety net. It is not about being used as a means of supplementing the incomes of people who can, if forced to do so, provide for their own income support by utilising their investments better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in fact isolated some instances where there are pensioners with large shareholdings, some of them in excess of $100,000, who are drawing the full pension. Is it fair to the other 97 per cent of pensioners who will not be affected by this treatment? Is it fair to those, for instance, who have equity trusts or property trusts or insurance bonds or friendly society bonds, who are presently the subject of treatment similar to that proposed for shares? These measures are part of an ongoing commitment by this Government to treat investments more consistently and to improve the equity in the system and remove opportunities to circumvent the income test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can come back all the time to the bottom line of this whole argument&mdash;the social security system is a needs based system and is there as a safety net. Pensioners should not be fearful of these changes. They should see their financial advisers or, better still, make an appointment to see the financial information service for pensioners, now called the Financial Information Service. It is free and I urge them to take up this opportunity. In many cases they may not even be affected. In other cases, alternative investments may be advisable to ensure that more income is generated from their investments. In many cases, not only will the Australian taxpayer be the winner but also the investors themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fringe benefits, as I heard you say in a speech this morning, Mr Deputy Speaker, have been extended and some 50 per cent of the pensioners who will be affected by the new share treatment will be the beneficiaries of that.

Some of the State governments, such as the Kennett Government and the New South Wales Liberal Government, are making it a little bit tougher for us. What they are about is kicking the pensioners.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As last week was National Marriage and Family Week, it is appropriate to reflect on some aspects of marriage and family in Australia today. I make these comments in the knowledge also that the United Nations has appointed 1994 as the International Year of the Family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the number of marriages in Australia each year is continuing to increase&mdash;from fewer than 80,000 in 1960 to of the order of 115,000 this year&mdash;the crude marriage rate has declined and, with the exception of females aged 25 to 29 years, first marriage rates have declined sharply. This decline partially reflects a trend in Australia toward marrying later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a return to the pre-World War II proportions of men and women who will never marry. In 1934, 18 per cent of women turning 35 had not married, but this figure fell to five per cent by 1972. The proportion is expected to increase to about 20 per cent by the end of this decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the 1960s the divorce rate rose to reach four per 1,000 married women, but climbed sharply to 19 per 1,000 in 1976 following the introduction of the Family Law Act. By 1979 the rate had fallen to 11 divorces per 1,000 married females and has since remained at about that level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the 20 years there has been a marked change in the pattern of divorces with respect to the duration of marriage. Prior to 1976, about 10 per cent of divorces dissolved marriages of less than five years duration and about 25 per cent dissolved marriages of 20 years or longer. Since then the pattern has changed, with around 20 per cent of divorces occurring to marriages of less than five years duration. Throughout the 1980s, the median duration of marriage has been a little over 10 years. Indeed, 50 per cent of all separations occur within the first seven years of the wedding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each year, more than 40,000 marriages in Australia are dissolved. In 1991, the number of divorces represented some 40 per cent of the total number of weddings in Australia that year. It is estimated that in 1990 some 55 per cent of the divorces involved one or more children, that is, some 45,000 children. Since 1975, some 700,000 Australian children have been deprived of the care of one parent for some part of their lives. By the end of the decade, this figure will have reached over one million Australian children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the major increase in divorce, the incidence of remarriage was relatively low. In 1971 fewer than 14 per cent of marriages involved remarriage for one or both partners. By 1981, however, this had risen to 32 per cent and it has remained at that level ever since. However, the separation and divorce rate for remarriages is higher, unfortunately, than for first marriages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes are also reflected in the composition of Australian households. Despite claims to the contrary, family households remain the popular norm for Australians. There were 4.2 million families in Australia at the time of the 1986 census. The great majority, 86 per cent, were couple families, 6 per cent of which were de facto couples. Just over half of all couple families had dependent children and, of these, approximately 90 per cent had children aged 14 years or under. The number of one-parent families increased sharply between 1976 and 1981 and more slowly between 1981 and 1986. The slowing of the rate reflects the stabilisation of the divorce rate since the early 1970s. Almost two-thirds of lone parents were either divorced or separated and only about 20 per cent had never married. In 1991, 87 per cent of lone parents were women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said this, I point out that the traditional family of mother, father and at least one child is still the Australian norm. At the time of the census, 75 per cent of households were family households. We can see, when it is looked at from another perspective, that 81 per cent of dependent children lived with married parents in 1986; 12 per cent with a sole parent; 4.7 with a step-parent and 1.7 per cent with parents in a de facto relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reflection on the changes which have occurred in family life in Australia leads me to some remarks about the provision of marriage education in Australia. The question arises as to what marriage education is, because education about marriage is often confused with marriage counselling. Unlike counselling, which is directed at particular difficulties encountered in a relationship, marriage education is a preventative process to give couples the skills to assist them in dealing with the potential problems which arise in family situations&mdash;problems, as I have pointed out, which frequently result in the high levels of marriage breakdown in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1987-88 the two national peak organisations&mdash;namely, the Australian Association for Marriage Education and the Catholic Society for Marriage Education&mdash;encouraged by the family services section of the Attorney-General's Department, have worked to develop and expand the provision of marriage education in Australia. This work was largely encouraged by the then head of the Family Services Section back in 1987-88, Mr John Dickie, whose foresight in encouraging the two national organisations ought to be recorded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a number of questions and matters which arose at that time for consideration which subsequent developments show as a pattern which has developed. It was thought at the time that marriage education could provide both an increased quality of relationship and also a preventative strategy against divorce, but there was little hard evidence in support of that proposition. However, if the proposition could be supported by research, then there was a clear need for the development of high standards and appropriate training for marriage education in Australia. Given the substantiation of the argument, a case for increased funding for marriage education was clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal led to a number of strategies which have been developed by the national organisations with the encouragement of the department over the past four or five years. The first was the appointment of a national trainer to enhance the standard and performance of marriage educators throughout Australia. The unfortunate aspect with regard to marriage education is that each year only some 10 to 12 per cent of couples marrying in Australia undergo any form of preventative education before their wedding. The appointment of the national trainer has led to an improvement in the training and standard of marriage educators around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the strategy was to carry out some research into the effectiveness of marriage education. That research was concluded last year and published in the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Love, sex and waterskiing</EMPHASIS>&mdash;`love, sex and waterskiing' being the description that one of the participants in the survey provided when asked about his idea of marriage. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HK5">Mr ANDREWS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at the one time, as my learned colleague points out. But this is a serious study and one which deserves further consideration and further research. It showed, for example, that 83 per cent of couples reported learning new skills as a result of attending a program; 42 per cent of couples said their ideas about marriage had changed a great deal; a third of couples said their program had raised new issues for themselves; five per cent of couples&mdash;this is an important statistic&mdash;either cancelled or postponed their wedding after attending a program; 91 per cent of couples reported after attending a program that they would seek professional help if problems arose in their marriage; and nearly 80 per cent of couples rated their program as good or excellent. So this report substantiated the proposition which had been advanced five or six years ago in showing that there is evidence to support the belief that marriage education is indeed an important preventive strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, with the encouragement, again, of the department, the Australian Association for Marriage Education has undertaken a pilot publicity program for marriage education under the title `How long before your marriage breaks down?', for which I have a poster. This program, which is being conducted in central Victoria at the present time on radio and television and in the press, will be an important indication as to whether or not publicity can raise that figure of 10 per cent of couples attending the programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the two peak bodies, AAME and CSME, working in conjunction with the department, ought to be congratulated and encouraged for what they have achieved over the past few years, and that model of cooperation by all the agencies in the field, through AAME and CSME, is one which no doubt stands as an example for the provision of other services in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a grievance I wish to present to this House on behalf of a number of constituents who reside in the Federal electorate of McEwen. It concerns the operations of Vic Roads and its management and control of entrepreneurial activities which occur adjacent to the Hume Freeway and other roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vic Roads has the total control and management of the freeway system of Victoria, which I might add is funded by this Government. It is fair to say that all of us on this side of the House are very proud of the achievements we have made in putting a decent road network nationally throughout Australia. In fact, for the first time in our history, we now have a sealed road which totally circumscribes this great country of ours&mdash;a great Labor achievement, I might add. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as Vic Roads is concerned, the Hume Freeway, which runs right through the centre of the electorate of McEwen, is under its total control and management. As one would expect, adjacent to the freeway there are people who run businesses of various kinds who are anxious to profit from the two million-odd vehicles a year which travel from Melbourne to the junction of the Goulburn Valley Highway, where the road then goes up through to the Tocumwal and the Newell freeways. Those two million vehicles, of course, are a major source of potential profit for people who reside adjacent to that freeway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Vic Roads takes the view that no-one can have access to that freeway&mdash;no-one&mdash;except those persons who, through what means I do not know, manage to enter into arrangements with Vic Roads and get a profit back to Vic Roads as a result. As an example, since the freeway system has been built on the Hume&mdash;it is almost finished to Wodonga and the border&mdash;there is only one service centre presently on that freeway between Melbourne and Albury-Wodonga, and that is at Glenrowan. It is a most garish, monstrous sort of a structure, I might add, with great neon lights and signs. That was done with Vic Roads by entering into an agreement where it takes a fat share of the profit out of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many years before that was built and Vic Roads allowed that to happen, a gentleman called Mr Rick Hill, who lives at Seymour&mdash;in fact, he still owns a drive-in theatre adjacent to the new freeway&mdash;applied for and got permission through the various planning schemes of the Victorian Government to build a truck stop. He has all of the necessary planning permits, has held them for over eight years&mdash;they keep getting extended every couple of years&mdash;and all he needs is permission from Vic Roads to access the Hume Freeway, to allow trucks to enter and exit from the freeway onto his proposed development. He has the funding, he has the planning permits, he has support&mdash;truck people say it is a very good idea&mdash;yet consistently now for over eight years Vic Roads has refused him the right to enter or exit the Hume Freeway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other examples of this strange monopoly and anti-entrepreneurial attitude Vic Roads has to its management of the freeway system&mdash;a system which we fund and over which we have little management control. Another family, the Plunkett family, just north of Seymour near Avenel, has a vineyard and a delicatessen and restaurant facility adjacent to the freeway. Some months ago the family was putting up signs&mdash;not big, garish signs but reasonably sized ones&mdash;on the freeway to tell people as they drove along that the facility was there, that they could pop in and buy wonderful Victorian products like pickles and homemade local products, and that there was a vineyard. It produces a very nice chardonnay, and if honourable members are driving past I suggest they pop in and buy a bottle&mdash;we all know Victorian wines are great, particularly in the McEwen area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then Vic Roads came along demanding that the signs be removed and threatening the Plunketts with prosecution. They are now limited to a smallish sign on their site itself. If travellers are whistling past at 110 kilometres per hour, which, thank God, is now the permissible speed on the freeway&mdash;one of the few things the Kennett Government has done that I can agree with&mdash;they are past the place before they see the sign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find this action an absolute madness. We are trying to encourage people to put dollars into profitable businesses, particularly in rural and provincial areas of Victoria and asking people to have a go, yet one of the major authorities in the State of Victoria, Vic Roads, is doing everything possible to prevent people from accessing two million motor vehicles and their occupants each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find its action illogical and what worries me even more is that one must have some suspicion as to why this is so. Whilst I have no evidence and whilst I am always careful in this House not to use the privileges I have to raise allegations which I cannot substantiate personally, there is a substantial body of opinion in Victoria, among people such as those I have spoken of, that one needs to have a means of encouraging certain people, if I can put it that way, in order to get Vic Roads to do anything, and that concerns me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me, firstly, that people are being denied their right to access a public highway; secondly, that Vic Roads will not communicate or talk to people; thirdly, that there are suggestions about it which have been on several programs. I think there was a gentleman from Werribee who publicly said that Vic Roads had given a right to Shell Australia to have sole access to the Princes Highway between Melbourne and Geelong, and yet it denies access to small firms and small entrepreneurs to get access to that freeway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me that we do not know. As a candidate, and in the last three years before I came back to this place, I have tried to find out what is going on with Vic Roads; I have tried to find out why people cannot access the freeway. I was supporting Rick Hill even when I was in this place before 1990, and I still cannot get satisfactory reasons from Vic Roads as to why he cannot have access to the Hume freeway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that this Government, my Government, actually made some inquiries and demanded from Vic Roads why roads funded by us but controlled by Vic Roads are operated in a way which denies reasonable people access to the vehicular traffic which uses them. Even more, I would suggest to this House that the actions of Vic Roads are uncompetitive and probably in breach of the Trade Practices Act. If Vic Roads is going to be the only authority that can say who gets what use out of the vehicular traffic using the freeways, and if it gets a hand in the till and a share of the cake under a joint venture agreement&mdash;and only big business is getting the opportunity to do that with Vic Roads&mdash;it seems to me that it is in breach of the Trade Practices Act and that it is time there was a major inquiry into this matter. It should be an inquiry which demonstrates to people that we care and through which we actually find out how these statutory authorities operate. </PARA>

The Parliamentary Secretary would do himself more credit if, instead of trying to justify this decision, he admitted that it had been made because the Government was out of money and had decided to take it out on pensioners. It is just impossible to regard this new measure as being fair. What is fair about including shares in this test but not the capital gain on other assets?

Pricewatch is a monthly survey of 36 basic shopping basket items carried out by volunteer shoppers around the State. It takes on the role of a consumer watchdog where consumers can participate in price surveillance to promote healthy competition amongst supermarkets. Our role is to keep the supermarket chains honest, particularly now as we move out of a recession, because the temptation for the supermarkets will be to profit take and they will do that at the expense of consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the electorate of Lilley, more than a dozen supermarkets are regularly surveyed by a team of volunteers who give their time to record prices. This price surveillance is very important because it brings the community much closer to the Government through a joint exercise. It puts price control on the public agenda because it allows low income people to express their concerns. It will also save them money. It makes consumers aware of the large discrepancies in prices throughout the State and encourages consumers to shop around. Usually, country people pay a lot more for their basic items. Times are tough enough for these people, and they certainly do not need this extra cost. That is why they should shop around. That is why Pricewatch is invaluable, and I appeal for more volunteers to come and join this worthy organisation. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="775" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to advise the honourable member for Watson that there has been considerable progress this financial year and, although Qantas will not be fully sold this financial year, the sale will be completed next financial year. The progress has involved a number of major features: firstly, the sale of Australian Airlines to Qantas in September for $400 million. That was decided following the very strongly held view of a number of the bidders that there were considerable economies and revenue enhancements possible if the two airlines were united. So the Government decided to put them together by way of a sale of Australian Airlines to Qantas and $400 million was paid for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then major steps have been taken to put the two airlines together in an integrated way, and that has most recently been announced as taking the form of Qantas operating its domestic flights increasingly as Qantas flights rather than Australian Airlines flights with new planes coming in Qantas livery for the domestic operations, the existing ones being repainted, using Qantas uniforms, Qantas flight designations, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there was recapitalisation of the combined airlines in February of this year and that has meant principally a debt to equity conversion of over $1 billion of government guaranteed debt which could not really be properly left in a privately owned enterprise. That reduced the debt to equity ratio from 84:16, which is very high, to a more commercially acceptable ratio of 70:30. It is projected that over the next few years that will come down to around 60:40.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there was completion of the trade sale of the combined airline in March of this year with 25 per cent of the equity being sold to British Airways for $665 million. Of course, British Airways is a major world airline which has been very successful since it was privatised in the mid-1980s. Its association with Qantas brings considerable additional strength to both airlines and should enhance Qantas's future prospects considerably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, there is the preparation for the float&mdash;or the public share offering, to give it its formal name&mdash;which will be one of the biggest floats in Australian corporate history, if not the biggest. Virtually all of the steps needed to be taken to proceed with the float have now been completed and this has involved principally a decision to sell up to 10 per cent of the equity in overseas markets, thus taking foreign ownership of Qantas up to the 35 per cent limit set by the Government and put into legislation passed by the Parliament last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a decision to provide for five per cent of the equity to go to an employee share ownership scheme so that the employees can have shares in the company, which would do much to enhance their incentive to perform. The appointment of lead managers for the domestic and international tranches of the sale has been made. There has also been the appointment of other financial and legal advisers, consultants, advertising agencies and providers of various other technical services required for the float. The contracts for all of these have been finalised or are now in the process of being finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two major factors remain to be done: firstly, the completion of the refinancing of about $1.3 billion of debt. That is subject to so-called change of ownership clauses. If the ownership is to change, then the debt has to be subject to some refinancing. In turn, that requires that Qantas have an international credit rating. That has almost been achieved and the rating should be available by the end of this month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second factor which needs to be decided is when we are actually going to go to the market. We are working towards the timing of the float being in October-November of this year or April-May of next year. We will be technically capable of going in October-November of this year, but whether we do so or not will depend on our assessment of what would be the most propitious timing. A decision to go in October-November would require a final decision to be made in the next couple of months.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that he, like many other members in the House, takes a very keen interest in this industry. I am sure the wine industry would like me to convey to members of the House that it appreciates their continued support for the domestic consumption of the product. But it really is in the export dimension of this industry that we have seen enormous progress made. The fact of the matter is that now for every bottle of wine uncorked in this country there is more than another bottle uncorked overseas. Exports now are the equivalent of $280 million a year, which has been a 13-fold increase since 1985.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, I was reminded yesterday, when I spoke to the president of the Winemakers Federation that this industry seems to be doing about as well as my football team at the moment. As for the future, because this is really where the opportunity does present itself, the industry expects that exports will top $1 billion by the turn of this decade. That will require an investment in this country in excess of $1.2 billion in terms of plantings and equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially this has been achieved, and the continuing improvement will occur, against the background of a supportive government environment. But it is important to note that most of this performance goes to the credit of the industry itself because it has been prepared to concentrate upon quality, with an emphasis on marketing into particular countries. In particular, it is promoting the unique quality that this country has in terms of the clean green image associated with food and food-based products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is government programs which the industry has had access to that have assisted the industry in this direction: the export market development grants scheme; the marketing skills program; the innovative agricultural marketing program; and the rural industries business extension services&mdash;all supportive of a pro-active export driven growth strategy for the industry. Recently the industry has been the recipient of the international trade enhancement scheme program, a $1.5 million extra payment, and it has also been very appreciative of the successful government efforts to open market access opportunities into Europe over the period of the growth strategy ahead of it. I am sure that, against that background, all honourable members will join with me in acknowledging the outstanding contribution that the wine industry has made to this country's export potential and wish it every success for the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, we all hope wine exports continue to grow. I direct my question to the Minister for Communications. Is it not a fact that, in relation to pay TV, the primary footprint of the satellite will not cover most of regional Queensland, most of regional New South Wales, regional South Australia, regional Western Australia, and Tasmania, with there being no coverage at all of the Northern Territory, and that there is no obligation on the satellite licensees to purchase an additional national beam from Optus in order to give coverage to all of Australia, even those living near the Simpson Desert?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the Leader of the National Party continues to confuse the coverage of 90 per cent of Australians with the coverage of the beam across the landmass of Australia. To achieve economic viability, the important thing for pay television is to get maximum coverage of the Australian population. Pay television means that people now have the choice of a new television service, for which they will pay, and therefore there must be penetration of the maximum market. That is achieved by compressed digital technology off the satellite, which can be rebroadcast by other methodologies, and that is what will happen in other areas of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I was talking to someone in my department who indicated that in the city of Adelaide, for example&mdash;where about 4 or 5 repeaters are currently required for normal, free-to-air television&mdash;in excess of 20 repeaters would be needed for MDS. The people of Australia do not want a range of towers sticking up all over the place when they can get a very good service by satellite. It does not necessarily mean that MDS is required in those other areas. There are hybrid systems that will give the maximum number of people in Australia pay television, for which they will only pay if they think the service is sufficient.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question. Elaborately transformed manufactures, including telecommunications and information technology, are Australia's fastest growing export sector. The Bureau of Industry Economics has forecast that telecommunications and information industry exports will almost treble to $3 billion during the course of the current decade. The Perth-based company to which the honourable member referred, QPSX Communications Ltd&mdash;formed only six years ago as a joint venture between Telecom Australia, the University of Western Australia and a team of electronic engineers&mdash;has just sold communications technology to carriers in Britain, Germany and the United States which enable large or complex messages to be sent quickly and securely through public telecommunications systems.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I repeat today in the House what I have said publicly before, and that is that the range of measures necessary to encourage enterprise bargaining as the whole basis of our new system of industrial relations is something on which the Government will be consulting closely with industry, trade unions and the community at large during the winter recess with a view to introducing legislation later on this year. As part of that process, I have had the opportunity to meet with the ACTU and a number of unions, and with all sorts of employer organisations and I intend to continue to do so in the course of the next couple of months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the questions that has been raised in those discussions is this issue of the non-union sector and the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, particularly section 134, which of course involved union participation. I have indicated to those who have raised this question that in New South Wales, where there is a system in place which does not involve any union representation, there has not been a great success thus far in pursuing enterprise agreements. Nationally, we now have some 830 agreements covering 700,000 employees. In New South Wales, without unions, we have a handful of agreements covering some 6,800 employees. So I do not think the answer to enterprise bargaining is to say that it is being held up in any way by a failure on the part of the union movement or for representation from unions. Having said that, it is a question which we will be talking about and one which will be addressed in the legislation that I will be recommending to the Cabinet and introducing in this Parliament later on this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Reid for his close and continuing interest in industrial relations. As the Government and the ACTU both agreed in accord mark 7, the primary means for future wage determination will be enterprise bargaining. Certainly, the Prime Minister once again emphasised that point in his speech on 21 April last in Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have consistently and persistently made clear, the system of enterprise bargaining that we intend to create will be underpinned with an up-to-date safety net of relevant award provisions to guarantee its integrity and to make sure that those not so well placed in bargaining power are protected. Far from being a halfway house, the system that we are proposing will be the best of both worlds: a system that is tailored to Australia's needs as an open trading nation but also, of course, that is mindful to protect the industrially weak and the low paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that is quite unlike the Opposition's policies which were so emphatically rejected by the Australian population in March and were about making Australia a low pay, low skill country. That was the Opposition's approach, and it is in great contrast with ours which is about flexibility laterally&mdash;flexibility upward, not downward&mdash;and which involves cooperation and will lead to a highly skilled, high wage work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth reminding the House that the policy pursued by the Opposition&mdash;and we have not heard too much about it since the election&mdash;would have taken Australia down the same path as Victoria, which has individual contracts. Let me tell the House what happened to someone in Victoria last week. An apprentice hairdresser was presented with an individual contract by his employer. It was a case of `take a $100 a week salary cut in a contract or take the sack'. That is the system that those opposite would have operating not only in Victoria but all around Australia. That is the reason why 600,000 people who were formerly under Victorian awards have applied to come under the federal provisions introduced by this Government in this Parliament in December last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Opposition's former Minister for Industrial Relations, Ian Macphee, has described that Victorian system&mdash;the system of those opposite&mdash;as one that is utterly unsatisfactory in fulfilling the economic objectives of the workplace. He is not one of ours; he is one of theirs. What have we seen from the honourable member for Bennelong since the election? We have seen a bit about the flag, a bit about Anzac Day, a bit about the monarchy and a bit about Liberal Party preselections, but we have seen precious little about industrial relations; that is for sure. The only thing he has been prepared to say is that he will not preside over the emasculation of the coalition's industrial relations policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that business needs to be more internationally competitive, and industrial relations is integral to that. That is why we have foreshadowed a new system of industrial relations; one that is aimed at speeding up enterprise bargaining. We have started that consultation and we intend to proceed with legislation later on this year. I say this to Dr Dowrick: I think his paper is a useful contribution, but I do not think it accurately reflects the system that we have in Australia. I do not think it accurately reflects the fact that we are moving from craft unions, and that we have an accord system operating in Australia. The Government's package will build upon our already unique system to give us one that even better serves Australia's needs.</PARA>

Amongst those is a mass media campaign using television and print media&mdash;and those television ads are running currently&mdash;specifically targeted advertising and trade journals and industry magazines.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These two weeks of Parliament were supposed to be the final indignity of the Opposition. They were to be the Government's triumph and in fact they have turned out to be two weeks of turmoil. In just on two months since the Government won the election we have seen it fully exposed on a number of fronts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been exposed by the facts as our economic circumstances have unfolded quite differently to the impression the Government created in the course of the election campaign. The Government has been exposed on policy where, in a number of areas, it has simply just picked up great slabs of our policy platform that we took to the last election. The generational change that was to take place on the front bench has totally exposed the inadequacy of the Government, and a number of people on the back bench have begun to speak out and expose the Government as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me begin by looking at the extent to which the Government has been exposed by the facts of our economic circumstances as they have unfolded in just the last couple of months. We should begin with today's unemployment data, which on face value with a fall in the measured unemployment rate might be taken as a welcome improvement, until we look behind the numbers and start to see the full magnitude of the unemployment crisis that has hit Australia in the course of the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's data for April show that something like 75,000 jobs were destroyed in one month and something like 100,000 Australians simply gave up looking for work. In circumstances of what is pretty much still a prolonged recession, at best bumping along the bottom of that recession, 100,000 Australians have decided that it is not worth trying to find a job and have left the labour force in the course of just one month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we combine this picture of one month with recent statements by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), that it is not inconceivable that the    number of long-term unemployed in Australia, those who have been unemployed for more than a year, could actually rise above 400,000 towards 500,000 people in the course of the next few years, we start to understand the magnitude of our unemployment crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen a very alarming jump today in youth unemployment, back to one in three of our young people who cannot find a job. In recent days we have seen some very disturbing data on the significantly smaller percentage of graduates this year who have been able to find a job compared with previous years under this Government. But the most disturbing feature of today is surely that 75,000 jobs were destroyed and that 100,000 Australians simply gave up in their search for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days we also had data on the balance of payments, which shows the magnitude not only of our current account problem but also of our continually rising debt problem. We saw a balance of payments deficit figure in one month of over $2 billion&mdash;a staggering figure; a figure that nobody would have predicted two or three years ago could even have been remotely possible at this stage of the economic cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the unemployment data and balance of payments data together, we get to see the full extent of the economic crisis that is bedevilling Australia at the present time. In simple terms, as the Government has admitted, we need more than three per cent growth, something approaching four per cent growth, to lower unemployment in a sustainable way. But on the other side, if we get three or four per cent growth, there is a very high probability of a balance of payments crisis. The Government has in fact got us caught in a pincer with nowhere to go. If it gets the growth up, high enough to start to make a dent on unemployment, this country will be hit with a balance of payments crisis, a blow-out in debt, and a further downgrading of our credit standing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, some of the economic forecasters in the private sector are now starting to reconsider their earlier assessments of Australia's growth potential. Most recently, yesterday Westpac lowered its growth forecasts for 1994, recognising that not only is the problem not being dealt with in Australia but also the world economy is still drifting, and in large part is still in recession. There are some alarming statistics and assessments now emerging in the United States. Many had pinned their hopes on the United States pulling the rest of the world out of this recession, but there is now recognition that growth numbers are being down scaled yet again. So we are still in a period of very flat activity, at best, in Australia. The national accounts for next quarter will be particularly interesting. We will see whether the so-called measured growth in this country is being sustained or whether it has faltered. On the basis of the anecdotal evidence we have seen in recent days, particularly in retail trade and the likely contribution from net exports, there is every possibility that our growth, as measured, has started to slow down and falter in the March quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been exposed on a number of policy fronts. On industrial relations, we saw the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) at the table today trying to give a description of this Government's emerging concept of enterprise bargaining, which has an eerie similarity to the policy we took to the last election. In fact, in substantial part, it was a direct pinch. We saw the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) on television recently talking about health policy and raising the possibility of tax rebates for people to take out private health insurance; that has an eerie similarity to the policy we took to the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, where has the Government been most decidedly exposed? It has been on tax. If the Government had any mandate from the last election, it was that there should be no new taxes and no tax increases. At this stage, I have taken a count of what we have heard in recent days. We have heard of the possibility of death duties being reinstated, of wealth taxes, taxes on high income earners, the reintroduction of the interest withholding tax&mdash;better called a pensioner tax&mdash;and a broadening of the wholesale sales tax base to include services, and perhaps, in effect, being a GST. The Government will not call it a goods and services tax but, as my friend the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) keeps reminding me, it will be a giant sales tax. So the Government is working on its own GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the possibility of energy taxes, given the balance of power in the Senate these days and the potentially high probability that it will be held by a couple of Greens. We have had the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) campaigning for years on the need to increase the Medicare levy. No new taxes or tax increases is the only mandate the Government has, and I assure those opposite that we will hound them on those tax increases every hour of every day until the next election. Whether the Government puts taxes up directly, or indirectly by forcing the States to do so, we are going to tag the Government with the lot of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of other policy areas have been exposed in recent days, but perhaps the most notable has been communications policy&mdash;or should I say a total lack of communications policy. The communications policy is a living, breathing document. Every time we turn around, it takes on a different form. In questioning the Ministers in this House and in the other place in the course of the last two weeks, we have seen that they have absolutely no capacity to explain or defend the shambles which has emerged, particularly in relation to pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we turn to the exposure of the individuals concerned, this place has become a total farce. The concept of ministerial responsibility under this Government has been totally jettisoned. There is no understanding of what a Minister's role is. There is no acceptance that a Minister carries responsibility for his or her actions, even though a Minister is actually required to sign off under an Act, and in the case of pay TV the Minister did so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a damning statement the other day when he tried to make it look like he was attacking us. He said that in the days when we were in government Ministers just had pieces of paper stuffed under their noses, signed them without reading them and then hopped into their white cars and ducked off. In my view, he was actually deliberately and knowingly bucketing his ministerial colleague Senator Collins for what has been a disastrous performance in that portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has Senator Collins been unable to explain how the farce of satellite pay TV emerged, but his counterpart in the House, the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall)&mdash;the most inappropriately named Minister in the Government, as he has shown a total failure to communicate anything in the course of the last two weeks&mdash;has revealed just how bad this factional system is and what poor products it turns out in terms of Ministers for the front bench of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a staggering performance. He never answered any question directly. He stood here on most occasions trying to read a prepared text, irrespective of the question that was asked. Every time one of us got up and asked a question he would start quivering down here and the fellow sitting where the Minister is sitting now, the Prime Minister, started quivering in that chair as well, fearful of what this bloke might say or do when he arrived on the scene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister approached the dispatch box we could hear the Prime Minister yelling to him the essence of the answer, but it was not to be absorbed by the Minister. He was hell bent on just delivering the text that had been prepared for him. We tried him in a couple of other areas of ministerial responsibility, areas about which he should have known something. One of my colleagues asked him a question about road funding and his answer was, `I was not expecting that question today but I will get an answer from the Minister and I will give it to you'. Then we asked him another question about regional coverage of television and he did not know about that either; he made the same comment. He said something like, `I was not expecting this question either. I do not know. I will speak to the Minister and I will get you an answer'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that he is the Minister responsible. In transport, it might be argued, the other guy has principal responsibility, but for television and communications he is the Minister, so undoubtedly he is now sitting back in his office asking himself the question. If a new program of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Faulty Towers </EMPHASIS>were being cast, it would not take long to see who would be playing the role of Manuel, would it? `I know; I do not know; I ask the Minister'&mdash;you can just see it coming. Wonderful stuff!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister at the table is another classic example of ministerial incompetence and ministerial failure. In conjunction with the Minister's mate the former Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, now the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), he had a&mdash;what was the word the Minister used today?&mdash;technical irregularity for making an illegal payment. Is that not right&mdash;a technical irregularity for making an illegal payment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the communications Ministers talking about potential deficiencies, we have had technical irregularities and we have got unintended consequences&mdash;all of them expressions designed to cover up one of the most incompetent frontbenches we have seen in many years. If Allan Border were running that lot, he would have a lot to say, and he would say it pretty well when he looked around the team as they went back to the end of the crease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are not the only ones. What about Senator Evans who has been unable to explain why he will not meet Mrs Gillespie and why it took him eight months to put in place these extradition proceedings which had been prepared eight months ago? He has been unable to explain it. But he did do one good thing. He did actually say quite openly and honestly, backing up the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), that all tax increases are on the agenda. In the other place, he would not rule out any of them. He was quite happy to contemplate the possibility of any of them, and I am sure in this year's Budget we will see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there was the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). He has made a great entry into the front bench, has he not? The first utterance, in the Governor-General's speech at the opening of Parliament, was to downgrade and patronise the position of women judges. That was a great entry into the field of the front bench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The smoothest of all on the front bench, the young up and coming Turk, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths), in a moment of rash honesty on his part&mdash;because they are trying to demonstrate to him that the only way they win on that side is through dishonesty&mdash;referred to our circumstances as those of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS>. That has been a pretty good start. Just look at them: Beddall, Collins, Beazley, Baldwin, Evans, Lavarch, Willis, Dawkins, Griffiths&mdash;what a team! In two weeks, you have just about annihilated half the frontbench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there are the backbenchers, who are not going to cop this sitting down. They and other members of the Labor Party are starting to speak out to expose more of the secret agenda. We have seen the secret agenda in the republican debate. Premier Goss was out there yesterday talking about abolishing the Senate. We have had Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development talking about the abolition of the States. We have had the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) talking about just about everything. If we focus on it, we see that he wants to change the reserve powers and other things. There is a very large agenda out there. There is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns), who was rolled in that factional brawl in Queensland and missed out on his front bench spot. He has decided to change the flag on their logo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a secret agenda here that goes way beyond the so-called Head of State in the republican debate. These guys are about changing the basic structure and fabric of Australian government and Australian society. We should have no doubt that others in the course of the next few weeks, as the factional pressures and the consequences of the factional pressures run their course, will start to speak out as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Poor old Gary Punch: remember him? He had a deal that he and Brereton would go up together. Brereton is on the front bench and Punch is still on the back bench because of Walker, who is just loved by the left wing faction right now. There are factional divisions which go to the very heart of it. Let us look at the position: the Government is exposed by the facts, exposed on a policy front, exposed by the backbench, and exposed by its own incompetence on the front bench. We might stop and ask ourselves what has changed on the other side? We have had an election, but what has changed? There are a few new ties, a few new dresses and a few new suits but, fundamentally, nothing else. It is just the same old tired lot over there. They have no direction, no policies, no mandate, no sense of direction for Australia, and no capacity to put in place, if it did have them, the policies that are required to deal with our very deep-seated economic circumstances as they have emerged and are still emerging. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not bought a new suit since the election so that last epithet cannot possibly apply to me.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if people moved to get rid of the GST from the package, they'd have to remove me.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the man who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean, I'm said to be inflexible, well I am, I'm not going to change. I mean the only way to be genuinely compassionate in Australia is to take the hard line and call for the decisions and advocate the right policies.</PARA>
<PARA>It has been the source of some mystery for people on this side of the House, and the public in general, why such flamboyantly expressed firm statements of what constitutes quality of leadership in Australian politics, so massively reneged on since the election, see the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) still sitting there&mdash;a man who gets up and criticises the Government's policies, policies which are directed at meeting the needs of the Australian population, at the same time as he sits with an $18 billion hole in his policy, as he desperately scrabbles against his backbench, against the National Party, and against other members of his frontbench to hold on to the total picture that he wishes to present of what an alternative Liberal Government would be. He staggers from one crisis to another in the Liberal Party, with his leadership constantly being undermined, yet he stands here and mentions a few odd-ball points and expects that he can mount a case against the Government when the mess on which he sits is putrid, and everybody knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recollect once or twice during the course of Question Time last year that when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was invited by the Leader of the Opposition to go to the polls, he said to the Leader of the Opposition, `No, I shall go to the polls at the normal time'&mdash;as indeed he did&mdash;`because I wish to do you slowly'. That was the position adopted by the Prime Minister and, indeed, he was good to his word&mdash;he did him slowly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It just came through, as far as I am concerned, at the last possible minute. Nevertheless, the slow doing was done. The difference between the situation then and the situation  now, because I think it has been a source of some mystery to us, is why such an utterly discredited leader is still there. He is not discredited by an election loss; they happen to politicians all the time and there is not necessarily any discrediting in an election loss&mdash;he is discredited because he has had to abandon everything he has stated firmly, publicly and repeatedly is absolutely essential to the country and, in a mealy-mouthed fashion, he has walked back from what he has said, has participated in no way in his party's debate, and in a humiliating way has tried to explain himself to the press, which has been his lot since the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an answer to that. The Liberal Party, having heard the Prime Minister, has now decided to do the Leader of the Opposition slowly itself. It said to him, `No, you haven't just lost us an election; you are not going to be allowed to run away from the consequences of losing us an election. What we are going to do is to haul you back into this seat so that we can inflict upon you maximum humiliation. You are going to have to sit there while the National Party, while some of our own backbenchers from Victoria, get up and say your policies on tariffs stink. The fundamental underpinning element of your industrial policy is that you should be taken by the ears and hung out to dry on it.'. That is what some elements of the National Party and those in Victoria are saying to the Leader of the Opposition. That is doing him slowly if ever there was such a thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the shadow Minister for industrial relations, the Manager of Opposition Business in the House (Mr Howard), stood up and said, `Dr Hewson may choose to abandon his policies by the bushel but I will not let him&mdash;cowardly backslider that he is&mdash;move one inch from the policies that I lay down as far as industrial relations are concerned', he was slowly making his contribution, turning the spit for the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then various backbenchers got up and said, `As far as Medicare is concerned, we cannot possibly go into an election campaign again with the policies we have adopted on Medicare. They are too threatening to the bulk of the population. As far as we are concerned, that policy will have to be abandoned'. And the spit continued to be turned slowly by that section of the Opposition backbench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a few weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition made a perfectly sensible statement&mdash;about a matter on which he had not declared himself before the election&mdash;when he said, `We are going to have a decent debate in the Liberal Party on the subject of republicanism. I have a mind to head down the road in that direction'. Then one of his frontbenchers, the shadow Minister for finance, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), stood up and said, `No. We will make a decision right now, thank you very much, and we will make it in favour of a monarchy'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS>, the father of the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) had some advice for members of the Opposition on their activities over the next two years: don't arrive at policies; arrive only at heroic poetry&mdash;read heroic poetry.

<PARA>That is the Leader of the Opposition's position. I would recommend to him the heroic poetry of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Ancient Mariner</EMPHASIS>&mdash;since we are all getting nautical on these matters&mdash;so that he can contemplate the many dead men on the side of the Liberal Party and the National Party after the election process. It describes what happens when people abandon what they regard as inflexible policies that must be pursued for the good of the country, and if they are not pursued to that end, the country's interests cannot be served. It indicates that, at least as far as the Leader of the Opposition considers himself situated somewhere in the political spectrum, he would definitely see himself among the living, with a thousand thousand slimy things beneath him. The thousand thousand slimy things, of course, are the Liberal Party's efforts to come to grips with policy over the next couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition comes into this place and says that there is an atmosphere of crisis arising from one month's figures&mdash;when, in fact, the unemployment rate went down. He challenged the Government to produce a set of propositions to deal with the falling unemployment levels and then had the hide, after challenging the Government, to cheerfully get up and say, `I do not think that we really need to arrive at policies for the next couple of years'. When challenged to state what particular policies he agreed with, he said, `Some, but perhaps not the GST. I do not really want to abandon the GST'. That is interesting. We should listen to that statement as frequently as we can, and take note of it whenever it occurs, because the Leader of the Opposition, who has been obliged by his party at this point to abandon the GST, is only too anxious to interpret any conceivable taxation suggestion thrown at the Government as obviously being a GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If somebody in the community makes a suggestion&mdash;for example, that the Government might consider broadening the base of indirect tax&mdash;then the Leader of the Opposition regards that as a GST. If somebody suggests that there should be consideration given to the introduction of a wealth tax, he considers that to be a GST. Anybody who actually knows anything about the GST&mdash;the Opposition is only half educated on the subject, with the Government assisting its education process no end over the last 12 months just to reach that half level of understanding&mdash;knows that whatever proposition those suggestions might constitute, they do not constitute a GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, if he is seeking to interpret those particular community suggestions on taxation as GSTs, there can be only one reason for him to do so. He is not a man who operates in ignorance on these matters; he at least has something of an idea about the general principles of the GST, if not the actual detail of it. He can be doing it for only one reason: he is trying desperately to clear the ground in public consciousness to continue the advocacy of the GST in Liberal Party policy. There is no other purpose served by making such ridiculous arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he wants to argue against tax increases, he should argue against tax increases within the framework of the particular taxes that are proposed and say whether they are justified in his view.

There can be only one reason why he would wish to do that, and that is that he wishes to clear the ground. </PARA>

In the couple of minutes available to me, I will try to deal with unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's figures are not what the Government would be satisfied with, but that is not a new factor as far as the Government's presentation of its position on economic issues is concerned. The Prime Minister made it quite clear during the course of the election campaign that he considered unemployment levels to be unacceptably high. We have had occasion to remark about the effect of the volatility of monthly figures and how difficult it is to follow them. The fact of the matter is that in the statistics that we have we get a situation month on month in which, when the number of jobs assessed as being in the community rises, the participation rate rises with it. When the number of jobs is lowered, in the way in which the survey is done, the participation rate tends to fall, producing results such as: so many people gave up work, or so many people increased work. If we actually take the minutiae of these monthly figures, we are asked to believe that one month, 150,000 people decide they want to enter the work force and the next month 150,000 people decide they do not want to be in the work force. We are expected to be impressed that somehow or other this has added to our capacity to analyse what is going on in the economy. Of course, we cannot. What we take of these figures is the underlying rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the past five months the underlying rate of unemployment has been falling. As far as job creation is concerned, for the past couple of months the underlying unemployment rate has been static. As far as young people are concerned, the unemployment rate amongst teenagers is 8.9 per cent. As far as the general community is concerned, the rate for this month is 10.7 per cent, down from 10.8 per cent last month. Those figures will bounce around, but the underlying rate will be more consistent. The underlying rate is going in the right direction, but it is not good enough. We said that before the election&mdash;it is not some new discovery on our part&mdash;and we have said it since the election. Our policies are devoted to dealing with the level of unemployment with a view to getting people back to work and dealing with the unemployed in a decent fashion to ensure that they have dignity and the means to sustain life. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

This has been raised many times in this House, and whenever the participation rate comes up we get some sort of diatribe about what participation was like 10 or 15 years ago and what it means. That misses the point. Australian society has changed dramatically in the last 10 or 15 years; it has not changed dramatically in the last month. Women constitute a much greater part of the work force. To compare participation rates today with participation 15 years ago is meaningless. Employment has dropped by 75,000 in the last month&mdash;that is 75,000 fewer jobs. In the 15- to 19-year old age group it is up above 32 per cent again&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And trending up, as my colleague says. I heard the Minister say a couple of minutes ago that youth unemployment was 8.9 per cent. That is fascinating, because no country in the world looks at unemployment as a percentage of the total population but rather as a percentage of the available labour market. If it was not so comical it would be serious, because to address a problem we have to first be prepared to face up to it and understand it, and the fact that the figures are so easily fiddled shows that there is no real willingness to face up to this problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at it historically, we had a census in 1933 at the height of the Great Depression, and youth unemployment then was the same as adult unemployment&mdash;about 21 per cent. The level of unemployment facing 15- to 19-year olds today is the highest that young people have ever faced in this country's history&mdash;higher than the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make three points. The first point is that I believe the Government is completely defeatist on this and it does not have a clue how it is going to get out of it; secondly, high unemployment is becoming a fact of Australian life; and, thirdly, I refer to the human consequences of what we are experiencing now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of things show that the Government is defeatist. A couple of weeks ago we had the Minister for Employment, Education and Training admitting that 500,000 people could be long-term unemployed by the end of next year. That is a wonderful bit of candour and political honesty. It is a pity he could not find the same honesty two months ago. We have been saying this for 12 months, and I have sat here and listened to us getting bagged by the other side because we dared to suggest what the Minister is now admitting. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been reported in the papers as saying just this week to the Caucus meeting, `We have to find novel ways of dealing with long-term unemployment'. That is wonderful&mdash;novel ways: `We don't have a clue as to how we are going to deal with it. We have to look for novel ways'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had reports before the election of the Prime Minister saying in a private speech that unemployment had been neutralised as an issue. That is wonderful! I would really like to know whether it is the 100,000 people who gave up work last month who have been neutralised or the 75,000 people who lost their jobs last month who have been neutralised, or both. The fact is this is all a game for the Government and it does not have a clue what to do. This is just like its response to youth unemployment. Do the honourable members remember all the fuss about that a couple of years ago? In a moment of candour the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) commented on that to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal Government policies to combat youth homelessness were a fuzzy response to political pressures in the hope that things might get better.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He went on to say that there was no way of knowing whether the money had done anything to help because . . . we weren't all too clear what the problems were at the beginning.</PARA>
<PARA>This Government's response to unemployment is the same: do something in the hope that it will go away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second factor is that high unemployment is becoming a fact of Australian life. In the course of the last Parliament unemployment in this country jumped from 6.1 per cent to 11 per cent. The last Government brought down three Budgets, three economic statements, and they all failed to arrest the increase in unemployment. The number of long-term unemployed has trebled over the last three years. It now stands at nearly 370,000 people. The long-term unemployed are becoming more and more entrenched in an increasingly unequal society. The fact is that after every recession the number of long-term unemployed are ratcheted up and they do not ever come down to the level they were beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened again today to the Minister trying to compare what happened after the last recession. The fact is that during the last recession the number of long-term unemployed in this country peaked in February 1984 at 230,600. The social costs of long-term unemployed are very well known. Last year Bruce Chapman, the person whom the Government is now looking to for solutions to the mess that it is in, made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current state of the Australian labour market augurs poorly for those already disadvantaged in the labour force, of which there are, and continue to be, very many. Our estimates and projections imply strongly the number of long-term unemployed will be, by a very large margin, at unprecedented and still growing levels over the next two years. There is not, now, any chance of avoiding this.</PARA>
<PARA>What a pity the Government did not ask him a couple of years ago what he might do, rather than waiting until it thought the problem needed to be massaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the then Victorian Chief Commissioner for Police, Kel Glare, a man noted for his impartiality, said publicly that he feared that young, long-term unemployed would become unemployable and a disenfranchised underclass. In my own State of Victoria, the number of break-ins has gone up 50 per cent in the last 10 years, 930 a day; serious assaults have gone up by 140 per cent; stealing by 69 per cent; and fraud by 110 per cent. Using statistical data it can be seen that youth crime, youth gang activities, and female crime have all increased. This is simply not an area where the Government has no role. The Government can set standards; it can set examples; it can try model approaches; it can evaluate; it can disseminate; it can initiate. Above all, it can lead. None of that is being done today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister recognised this in 1980 when he was in opposition in the old Parliament House. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If honourable members opposite think that the Baader-Meinhof groups and the urban guerillas in Western Europe will not be a feature of Australia as we move through the 1980s with high levels of unemployment in the cities, I think they may be disappointed.</PARA>
<PARA>He imagined the future social consequences; he has done nothing at all about it. All these are just numbers. Imagine the human consequences of each one of them. Imagine you are Brian, unemployed for the first time in your life after 40 years of continuous employment; 56 years old, employed continuously for 10 years as a metal polisher. For Brian, loss of employment has meant a dramatic change in his lifestyle. His family can no longer afford to live in a house&mdash;they rent a caravan&mdash;to have a phone, to have private health insurance, a car, excursions for their kids, holidays, and going out for meals with friends.

It is also what this Government is doing to the Australian economy&mdash;doing it slowly. The second point I make is that I happen to believe there is still a place in politics for honesty&mdash;not honesty two months after an election but honesty before an election&mdash;and courage to be prepared to actually go out and argue for a set of policies which might do something to confront the long-term problems this country faces.

It proposed to cut young people's wages to $3 per hour and reduce social benefits; for example, reducing the Medicare rebate and so increasing the cost of going to the doctor.

In fact, labour is cheaper in this country now than it has been for a decade. The international comparison also shows that unit labour costs in Australia are lower than those of our major OECD partners with whom we would want to compare ourselves. One of the great myths which has been perpetrated in Australia is the alleged high cost of Australian labour. The Opposition's solution to the unemployment problem was to strip workers of their rights of representation to ensure that they had reduced bargaining power and thus their wages would be less in the future than they are now. In fact, the Opposition's Fightback document&mdash;all 700 pages of it&mdash;was modelled on the predication that there would be a zero increase in wages through to the year 2000. That is the basis upon which those opposite modelled their graphs in that 700-page document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other proposal those opposite put to the Australian people&mdash;which was rejected out of hand&mdash;was the $7 billion cut in government spending. We do not need a PhD in economics to understand the direct impact on employment of a $7 billion reduction in government outlays. At various times during the past year different opposition spokespeople were at least honest enough to acknowledge that, in the short term, their policies would have increased unemployment. There was an admission by those opposite that their policies would, in the short term, have increased the number of people out of work.

It was going to abolish the best practice demonstration program, which has been a great success and is doing many good things in Australian industry. Admittedly those opposite proposed to increase TAFE funding, but to nowhere near the sort of level this government has provided. Had the Opposition been elected, the TAFE sector would have received less money than it will receive under this Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the motion on the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. I refer to subparagraphs (1)(p) and (q) and paragraph (2). I would like the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) to clarify exactly what the provisions in subparagraphs (1)(p) and (q) actually mean in relation to the question of the publication of in camera evidence that was the subject of some controversy in the previous parliament as a result of a dissenting report that was compiled by me, Senator Vanstone, Senator Crichton-Browne and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). I note that the former chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), is present in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter relates to the publication of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Operation Ark</EMPHASIS> report published by the committee to which I, the two senators and the honourable member for Gippsland attached a dissenting report in which we published some evidence that had been obtained in our inquiries that was pertinent to that report, which attempted to clarify some of the issues that we believed very strongly were not covered in the majority report of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, it is important that we clarify the terms contained in subparagraph (1)(p). I am interested in learning exactly what is meant by `operational methods and results of investigations of law enforcement agencies' so that we are in a position as House of Representatives members of the joint standing committee to understand what the motion, which presumably will be carried, will mean as to the publication of material collected as a result of the inquiries of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the central issues that has arisen as a result of the controversial <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Operation Ark</EMPHASIS> report was that in the Senate Standing Orders there is provision for individual dissenting members to publish in camera evidence that they see as being pertinent to the matter raised in the dissenting report. As we know, the Standing Orders of the House of Representatives do not permit that to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Operation Ark</EMPHASIS> report was tabled in the Senate, along with the dissenting report. There was some controversy as a result. As a consequence, a matter was referred to the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges as a result of the matters arising from that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important principle arising from this is the principle that in a joint standing committee there is a conflict between the Standing Orders of the Senate and the Standing Orders of the House of Representatives. The Standing Orders of the Senate contain the underlying principle that an individual member may use in camera evidence to substantiate, obviously in good faith, matters arising from the publication of the committee's dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the authors of the dissenting report, we felt it necessary that substantial matters concerned with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Operation Ark</EMPHASIS> report should be exposed to public view. Following the tabling of that report, a letter was received by Mr Justice Stewart, the former chairman of the National Crime Authority, and tabled in the Senate. That letter substantiated the intent of the position undertaken by me and my fellow co-authors, Senator Crichton-Browne, Senator Vanstone and the honourable member for Gippsland. In particular, I suppose the actions we took were vindicated to that extent by the Senate Committee of Privileges in its 36th report published last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is important that when moving this motion the Leader of the House should clarify exactly the intent of subparagraphs 1(p) and 1(q) and exactly what it is that we are in fact conveying to the Senate by way of the intent of clause 2. It is clear that there is a conflict between the two chambers and that the Senate Standing Orders allow for the publication of in-camera evidence under the circumstances which I have mentioned. I might add also that there is no question that, in the publication of the evidence in the report I have referred to, there was any exposure of operational matters&mdash;and I mean operational matters in the pure sense of the word&mdash;that would endanger the operations of the National Crime Authority or anyone associated with any inquiries being undertaken by the National Crime Authority or, for that matter, would make an investigation more difficult to conclude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, much of the controversy was redundant because the reality of the evidence exposed in the dissenting report was that it related more specifically to deliberations between the members of the authority and members of the previous authority over the dates and other matters relating to the actual compilation and publication of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Operation Ark</EMPHASIS> report some 2 1/2 years ago. Under those circumstances, perhaps the Leader of the House might help us by clarifying exactly what is intended by the inclusion of those three paragraphs in the motion he has just moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am not really familiar with the detail of the matter the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) has raised, except to say that whatever he felt to be unsatisfactory about the operations of the committee in the last Parliament has neither been advantaged or disadvantaged by the incorporation of these two items. They are a direct lift from the equivalent paragraphs of the motion establishing the committee last time around and, therefore, they do not make any difference to the sets of circumstances he mentioned or, if they did, they would have made a difference during the course of the last Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is more the sort of issue that needs to be taken up with either the Privileges Committee and/or the Procedures Committee of the House. As what the honourable member seems to be saying appears to have some substance in it, it would probably be in his interests to consult with either or both of those bodies, or, in the first instance&mdash;and I think this is probably the best course of action on his part&mdash;to take it up with the Speaker and the Clerk. He can then work his way through what seemed to me as I listened to him to be a fairly complex process. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 1 to 5 (1993); and Excise Tariff Proposals No. 1 (1993).</PARA>
<PARA>The tariff proposals which I have just tabled contain alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and the Excise Tariff Act 1921. Customs tariff proposal No. 1 (1993) was introduced into the House on 17 December 1992 by the former Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs, Mr Beddall, in the previous Parliament. As the change had not been enacted when Parliament was dissolved, the initiative lapsed and is now reintroduced in this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tapestry kits are free of customs duty while other needlecraft kits are dutiable at 15 per cent. Both types of kit are designed for needlework hobbyists. As such they compete with and are direct substitutes for each other. There has been an ongoing problem with the identification of each type of kit. In addition, this situation has been further aggravated by a recent Federal Court decision. As a result of this decision many kits not considered by the industry to be tapestry kits are now legally defined as such. As there is no local manufacture of these kits, the Government has decided to dispense with the tariff advantage enjoyed by tapestry kits by providing a free rate of duty for all kits of heading 6308. The change has been backdated to operate from 1 January 1988 when the current harmonised tariff was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs tariff proposals Nos 2 to 4 (1993) formally place before the Parliament, as required by law, tariff alterations made by notice published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> during the recent recess of Parliament. Customs tariff proposal No. 2, which operated between 13 October 1992 and 28 February 1993 provides for the continuing duty free importation of certain handkerchiefs which are imported in bulk. Procedures to allow the ongoing duty free importation of the subject goods after 1 March 1993 have been provided under the customs by-law system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs tariff proposal No. 3 contains four separate changes which came into effect on 1 March 1993. After discussions with the Canadian Government, this Government will phase out the Canadian margin of preference on certain carpets of tariff chapter 57. This will be achieved by freezing the Canadian rate of duty at its pre-1 March 1993 level until such time as the general rate of duty for the subject goods phases down to the existing Canadian rate. Last July the previous government announced a review of the customs by-law system as it relates to textiles and textile goods. The review is now complete and alterations made to part III of schedule 4 result from recommendations made by the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority. The changes combine previous concessions available to importers into one enlarged item. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the abolition of quota restrictions on textiles, clothing and footwear from 1 March 1993, administration of quota restrictions on cheese and curd have been removed from schedule 5 and placed in a new concessional item 61 in schedule 4. There is no change in duty levels involved in this amendment. Customs tariff proposal No. 4 (1993), operative on and from 10 March 1993, accords concessional rates of duty to the new countries of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic under the Australian system of tariff preferences. The new countries have evolved from the agreed division of the former Federal Republic of Czechoslovakia towards the end of 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs tariff proposal No. 5 (1993) will operate from 1 July 1993. In the 1991 March industry statement, initiatives were announced to assist local manufacturers of passenger motor vehicle components. That announcement revealed that certain components which had a rate of duty of 15 per cent on 1 July 1992 would not participate in the general phasing down of tariff rates. This proposal implements that decision in relation to those tariff subheadings which contain passenger motor vehicle components and have a margin of preference for goods of Canadian origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Excise tariff proposal No. 1 (1993) details rates of excise duty which took effect in 1992 pursuant to excise tariff proposals Nos 1 and 2 (1992). These proposals lapsed upon the dissolution of Parliament on 8 February 1993 and their effect is reinstated by excise tariff proposal No. 1 (1993). These measures are included in the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1993 introduced into the House last week. Summaries of the alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's speech at the opening of the 37th Parliament. Of all the opening speeches to Australian Parliaments there has hardly been one with less vision than this year's speech. It was simply a lengthy regurgitation of election promises, presented without flair or imagination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest any of those listening should think that I am reflecting on the personage of the Governor-General, who had the unfortunate task of delivering the speech, I remind them that the text was actually written in the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Address-in-Reply has provided the opportunity over the past two weeks for new members to make their first speeches in this House. In listening to new members on the Government side, one thing is apparent; namely, the number of members who owe their place here not so much to a constituency but to the patronage of the union movement. With few exceptions, the parliamentary Labor Party today consists of Labor Party apparatchiks whose contribution to the nation has been in the unions and the Labor Party as functionaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More and more this Labor Party Government has come to represent narrow sectional interests, its representatives here being the professional bureaucrats whose management of unions and the party, replete with salary packages to match, is increasingly remote from ordinary Australians. Yet we are now met with the arrogant assertions from this Government, from the Prime Minister himself down, that somehow Labor is the natural party of the nation&mdash;despite, I might add, not having attracted the support of almost half of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the new honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), a former prime ministerial functionary, repeated this blandishment in his first speech when he said that the aspirations of Australians were held only by those on his side of the House&mdash;aspirations which included full employment, aspirations which included this nation having a role in Asia and aspirations which included having an effective education system in Australia. No wonder the Prime Minister could claim privately, as he thought, that `we have been able to spin a giant tale'&mdash;a tale, of course, being nothing other than a fictitious story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But hardly a week passes in this place without the honourable member for Blaxland uttering gratuitous aspersions about, for example, Robert Menzies. Within weeks of his election he was describing Menzies as a political cheat. His other great contribution to the truth on that occasion was to guarantee no increase in taxes, a promise which has already been jettisoned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the Menzies era which the Prime Minister decries. Better still, let us compare those awful Menzies years, as he likes to characterise them, with the glorious 1980s over which the Prime Minister presided as Treasurer. We had an average five per cent economic growth in the 1950s. In the 1980s it was 4.3 per cent. For inflation, the figure was 2.4 per cent in the 1950s and 7.4 per cent in the 1980s. Unemployment in the 1950s was 2.1 per cent; in the 1980s, when the Prime Minister presided over the country as Treasurer, the unemployment rate averaged 7.9 per cent. What is it now? We would like to have a figure of 7.9 per cent today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Real wages increased for ordinary Australians during the 1950s by an average of 2.5 per cent. During the 1980s they decreased by 0.4 per cent. Most Australians would have preferred similar results from the Prime Minister during the 1980s. These attacks barely mask a personal insecurity&mdash;the art of the little man trying to build himself up by putting others down. Here is the psychology of projecting onto others his own faults, calling us on this side of the House divisive to mask his own divisiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the Prime Minister claims that we attack institutions to camouflage his own attacks on institutions. Let us take the republican issue. There are many Australians I suspect who would possibly embrace the notion of a republic if it were not for a churlish refusal by the Prime Minister to concede that anything British has advanced our nation. Even the popular writer John Mortimer, who is an avowed socialist, wittily remarked in his autobiography <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Voyage Around My Father</EMPHASIS> that perhaps Britain's greatest gifts to the civilised world were the rule of law and the herbaceous border.

Hardly a day goes by without some insulting remark during Question Time. But those waiting to hear a prime ministerial statement about anything should not hold their breath.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this is in an attempt to rewrite history&mdash;in the words of Manning Clark, to view the historian as a prophet. Why should we not consider the reality and not the Prime Minister's tale? Menzies said in 1958 that the Liberal Party did not seek to win elections by making lush promises about social services. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have, let me remind you, always performed much more than we have promised.</PARA>
<PARA>He might have added that Labor always promises much more than it performs&mdash;the most recent example being the abandonment of promises to remove pensioners from the tax system by 1995, a promise which was included with the Prime Minister's election statements made at Bankstown during the campaign launch itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically we on this side of the chamber have always seen ourselves as having a mandate for social compassion and social reform. Alfred Deakin, for example, explained liberalism as a belief in equality of political rights without reference to creed, and equality of legal rights without consideration of wealth or quality. Votes for women and the principle of one-man, one-vote were the very plinth upon which this platform was based. Liberalism taught that all, including the poorest in the community, should have their due, and that there should be a minimum rate of wages and wise factory legislation to prevent wealth from taking advantage of the needy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early stages of the Second World War, the Menzies Government announced that social security was to be the one major objective of the post-war period. In 1941 he began a series of new social security programs with the scheme of child endowment. The previous Labor Government had boasted that it would create a national health scheme but had done little more than quarrel with the very people, the doctors, whose cooperation was then vital. It took Australia's first Liberal Government to create a national scheme in 1949. It was not at that stage a comprehensive scheme being, as we recall, only for invalid, old-aged, widows and service pensioners. But it was a Liberal government which started it. At the time it was said to have no superior in any part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same government doubled the unemployment benefit and raised pensions which had not gone up under the previous Chifley administration despite rapidly rising prices. Liberal governments oversaw enormous increases in immigration&mdash;the great post-war immigrant influx. During the years of Liberal governments when the Labor Party was under the leadership of Arthur Calwell, there was virtually no difference between the Labor and Liberal social policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out a couple of recent social welfare policy signposts on the Liberal side. It should not be forgotten that the Fraser Government introduced the system of family allowances. It is also important to remember that it replaced the pension means test with an income test, including provision for automatic changes in the rates of pensions and benefits in line with changes in the consumer price index. The same government&mdash;the Fraser Government&mdash;also set up a consultative committee on women's welfare, which Labor has continued but in a more straitened form. In fact, Liberal governments have introduced a wide range of social initiatives over the past 50 years. Since we are approaching 1994, the International Year of the Family, it is probably timely to mention that it was a Liberal Government in 1961 which established funding for marriage counselling programs, and in 1976 established funding for marriage education programs. In fact, much of what passes for achievement in the current Government's rhetoric is in fact little more than a mirage in the desert. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is enough of the Prime Minister's revisionist history. Let me now turn to his record. If there were one statistic which should be seared into the hearts and minds of all Australians it is that, while in 1982-83 the income of the top one per cent of income earners in Australia equalled the total earnings of the bottom 11 per cent, by 1988-89 the top one per cent was earning an amount equal to the total incomes of the bottom 21 per cent. In other words, from a situation where one per cent equalled 11 per cent, we moved to a situation, during an administration in which the current Prime Minister was the Treasurer of this country, where the top one per cent of Australians earned as much as the bottom 21 per cent of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the 1980s we have seen a massive redistribution of income in Australia&mdash;a redistribution of income away from many Australians. There are plenty of collaborative studies that support those statistics. A study by Phil Raskall, prepared as part of the inequality project conducted by the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, found that families earning between $20,000 and $40,000 a year have been the big losers. They have suffered a 20 per cent drop in their share of national income since 1975, while well-off families have increased their share by 10 per cent. A study by Dr Ann Harding of the Department of Social Security showed that under the Labor Government the incomes of most social security recipients increased by a much higher percentage than the incomes of most wage and salary earners. But&mdash;and it is a big but&mdash;most of those people still remain in the poor category, even after receiving the increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Professor of Economics at the Australian National University's Research School of Social Sciences, Robert Gregory, found that the number of low and high income earners in this country has grown significantly, while the number of middle income earners has fallen, constituting an assault, in economic terms, on the great middle ground of ordinary Australians. Labor, despite all its rhetoric, has created a less equal society. In fact, it is one of the great obscenities of our time that this Government can parade itself in the garb of compassion when every objective indicator says otherwise, and every objective assessment of its policies leads inevitably to the opposite conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to statistics released in last year's federal Budget papers, more than 300 people with taxable incomes over $1 million paid an average tax rate of 26.1c in the dollar. Those figures reflect the tax changes for higher income earners introduced by the Labor Government. Top earners did not do nearly so well under the previous Fraser administration. Since 1971, the proportion of the population dependent on social security payments&mdash;consisting mainly of pensions and benefits&mdash;has more than doubled, with over five million Australians presently receiving some form of social security payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upshot of that evidence, which all points in the one direction, is that, in the last 10 years, Australia has become a less equal society than the United Kingdom. In fact, in a comparison of eight developed countries, we are now only more equal than Germany and the United States. The Director of the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, Peter Saunders, concluded that the share of income going to the 60 per cent of Australian families in the middle to low income brackets was smaller than in any of the other countries he had studied. If we look, for example, at the situation of women in this country&mdash;many women having become the family's second income earner&mdash;we see a feminisation of poverty. At least 50 per cent of the sole parent families that are headed by women live in poverty. While the percentage of women in the work force has increased, in many cases women have gone into the work force to do the lowly paid jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all part of the Government's compassion and, as its rhetoric tells us, part of the creation of a more equal and a more inclusive society. Every independent objective indicator of the changes that have occurred to Australians and Australian families over the last decade points to the contrary. Yet the Prime Minister seeks to tell us that his Government and his administration&mdash;of the Treasury, for example&mdash;has created a better, fairer, more equal society than in the past. That is simply total nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, for all his talk of inclusion, has done more than any other person in my lifetime to divide Australia and to bring people closer to Henry Lawson's prophesy that blood would stain the wattle.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy to become cynical about politics and the election process. People talk about media manipulation of the electorate, about television and advertising executives setting the agenda, and about the disempowerment and alienation of the average person in the street. Yet this election proved that the Australian electorate will not be swayed, either by the media or the advertising industry. Despite just about every national and regional newspaper editorialising against the Government, and despite the Opposition's 18-month Fightback sales campaign, the Australian electorate rejected the Opposition's policies. With hindsight, we on this side of the House can say that the choice was obvious and inevitable; that the Australian people had no choice other than to reject the Opposition's rabid free-market policies and its plans to virtually eliminate the trade union movement, Medicare and our world-renowned social welfare programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993 election result is testimony to the success of the democratic process in Australia. The process is perhaps far from perfect. For example, this Parliament does not yet reflect the gender balance and ethnic diversity of Australia. However, when we consider that millions of people across the globe still resolve their political differences by non-democratic and often violent means, our democracy is indeed something to celebrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a joyful experience for me personally to be elected as the honourable member for Leichhardt on 13 March. This is my 20th year as a member of the Australian Labor Party and, like several of my colleagues who have already given their first speeches, I was very much inspired to join the Labor Party by Edward Gough Whitlam in 1973 and by his truly reforming government. A highlight of my election campaign was Gough's visit to Cairns in late 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an honour and a challenge to represent the people of Leichhardt in this House. Leichhardt stretches from a few kilometres south of the PNG border, through the Torres Strait Islands to the Cape York Peninsula, including the five communities of the northern peninsula area as well as Aurukun, Lockhart River, Pormpuraaw, Kowanyama, Hope Vale, Coen and Cooktown. The main population centre in the electorate is, of course, the thriving city of Cairns and the surrounding Mulgrave shire.

I will ensure that the Cairns community gets the benefit of whatever federally funded programs are available through the better cities program of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) to help improve the city's infrastructure. While Cairns is a well serviced city, there is no getting away from the fact that it is three days drive from Brisbane. The Federal Government has undertaken major works on the Bruce Highway between Cairns and Townsville and naturally I will work to ensure that the road network in Leichhardt is prioritised in the Federal Government road funding program. </PARA>

A social justice program now includes access to new information technologies for the disadvantaged, and in this context I welcome the Government's pilot `telecottages' program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite its remoteness, the Cairns region has thrived because of its diverse primary industry base. Tin and gold mining drew European settlers to the region in the 1870s, and then in the 1880s large scale sugar growing began in the Russell and Mulgrave River valleys. Both the mining and sugar industries are still vitally important to the economy of the Far North today. The largest mine in my electorate is at Weipa on the eastern coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria, where the value of bauxite production increased by an estimated 13.4 per cent to $269 million in 1991-92 while estimated production volume increased by 13.4 per cent to 11.4 megatons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland sugar industry is continuing to expand up and down the coast, although there has been some contraction in the Cairns area due to urban encroachment. There is no doubt that the sugar industry was a big winner in the 1993 election campaign. The Government's sugar industry package is proof yet again of the consummate negotiating skills of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). The future of the sugar industry is assured as a result of the Government's tariff freeze commitment and the joint State and Federal $40 million infrastructure spending package. I will make it my job to ensure that canefarmers and millers in the Leichhardt electorate get their fair share of that assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Far North region is booming in terms of international trade. In fact, the top half of Queensland, from Mackay north, exports some $5 billion annually&mdash;roughly half of Queensland's annual exports. Putting that into a national perspective, the northern part of Queensland earns as much from exports as South Australia, the Northern Territory and Tasmania combined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, remoteness and isolation from the southern capital cities has in the past been a trial residents in the Far North have had to overcome. How times have changed. Cairns is still remote from Sydney and Melbourne but is on the doorstep of Asia and the Pacific. Cairns is closer to Indonesia than it is to Canberra. Primary, manufacturing and service industries in my electorate are ideally located to develop trade and investment links with our Asian and Pacific neighbours, which is consistent with Australia's national export strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the proximity of the Far North to the Pacific and South East Asian export markets gives us a head start on the rest of Australia, the regional economy of Leichhardt must continue to diversify. Industry policies encouraging value adding and manufacturing will enable us to build on the economic bank of tourism and commodities. With this diversity comes maturity of the regional economy and, importantly, long-term sustainable employment. I believe that with a targeted manufacturing policy, not the neoclassical solutions of those opposite, we will achieve this goal. Here I endorse the comments of my colleague the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) on the need to reform the Industry Commission and the  honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) on the future direction of industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have saved my discussion of the biggest export dollar earning industry in my electorate to last; that is, as my friend the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) says, tourism. In 1992 international tourism to Australia generated $8 billion, up 8.9 per cent on 1991. This accounted for 11 per cent of Australia's total export earnings. The spectacular natural environment of Far North Queensland is responsible for attracting more than its share of those foreign exchange dollars. For example, of the 2.4 million international visitors to Australia last year, 18 per cent spent at least one night in the Far North, and an incredible 6 per cent cleared customs for the first time at the Cairns airport, currently the fifth busiest airport in the country and predicted to be the second gateway into Australia by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my brief time in this House I have heard many members describe their electorates as the most beautiful in Australia. Of course, I am going to assert the same. But, unlike my colleagues, I am not exaggerating. I am backed up by the people of Australia and international visitors who have voted with their feet on this question. A quarter of a million people visited the Far North last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While tourism has brought about an economic boom in the Far North&mdash;that has, to a large extent, cushioned the region from the worst affects of the last recession&mdash;it has also brought some downside affects. Tourism growth has put pressure on housing supply which has particularly affected the rental market in Cairns, and placed enormous demands on welfare agencies and community infrastructure. The challenge for any parliamentary member in the Far North&mdash;and here I include my good friends, my State parliamentary colleagues&mdash;is to resolve the conflicts between tourism development and the preservation of our natural environment. And of course there has been conflict in recent years over the extent and nature of tourism development. However, today as I travel within my electorate I certainly do detect a change in the attitude of previous antagonists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very few people in Cairns today who want the Far North to become like Honolulu or Miami or&mdash;dare I say&mdash;the Gold Coast. The word on everybody's lips is `sustainability'. The tourist industry recognises that the environment is our region's greatest asset and attraction and to destroy that is to destroy the region's future. The environment movement&mdash;and here I give praise to the Cairns and Far North Environment Centre, of which I am proud to be a member&mdash;is open to dialogue about sustainable growth strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, major campaigns to preserve the beautiful natural environment in my electorate have already been won. The rainforest of the wet tropics area and the Great Barrier Reef have both been World Heritage listed. The Wet Tropics Management Agency, which is located in Cairns, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in Townsville, have been set up by this Government to manage these unique natural environments so that all Australians and international visitors can enjoy them for generations to come. We cannot afford to be complacent, given the fragility of our natural environment, and I will strive to ensure that the magnificent natural beauty of the Far North is preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The threat of an oil spill on the Great Barrier Reef is of particular concern to many of my constituents in Cairns because of the potentially devastating environmental and economic consequences for the region. While we have a reef plan as well as national and State oil spill plans, there is no doubt that the best plan to take is whatever measures are necessary to prevent an oil spill from happening in the first place. Therefore, I take this opportunity to call on this Government to implement the recommendations of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame: inquiry into ship safety.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the 1991 census, 84 per cent of jobs in Cairns are in the service industry and many of these are directly or indirectly generated by the tourism industry. I believe that this Government's national tourism strategy will provide the direction and the policies that will help create new jobs in the tourism industry. In addition, federally funded programs administered by skillshare, DEET and the Cairns TAFE will help equip people with the skills they need to find jobs in the hospitality industry. Just as importantly for the long-term viability and vitality of the region, the Federal Government has committed $9 million over three years to build a new Smithfield campus of James Cook University at Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect of the tourism industry that has the potential to create hundreds of jobs in the far north is cultural tourism. A survey done by the Australia Council in 1990 found that half the visitors to Australia were interested in learning about Aboriginal arts and culture, but only seven per cent of visitors were actually able to see a performance of Aboriginal theatre, dance or music. In Cairns, and up the Cape York Peninsula to the Torres Strait, it is impossible to deny the living culture of indigenous Australians; so once again the Cairns community is ideally placed to take advantage of the growing international, and I hope domestic, interest in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. Clearly, there is an urgent need to implement the recommendations of the June 1992 report of the Department of Arts, Sport the Environment and Territories, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Study of cultural tourism in Australia</EMPHASIS>, ensuring that indigenous culture is not trivialised in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this International Year of Indigenous People there are a few more observations I would like to make about relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. I believe in self-determination for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia. The former Minister, Gerry Hand, and the present Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) have earned the respect of many indigenous Australians as a result of the formation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>

There has been a lot of uncertainty about the consequences of the High Court's Mabo decision and, along with many people in the far north, I look forward to the report of the Prime Minister's special ministerial Mabo committee later this year. I believe that there is an urgent need for the Government to legislate to clarify existing and future rights to land in the interests of indigenous Australians, as well as the mining and pastoral industries; otherwise only lawyers will benefit from costly litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people&mdash;and that includes people on the other side of the House&mdash;say that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have too much money spent on them. Fightback wanted to cut $90 million from the ATSIC budget. Obviously, such people have never travelled to remote communities in my electorate. I travel regularly amongst remote Aboriginal communities on the peninsula and in the Torres Strait, and every time I go to these communities people say to me, `All we want is the basics that the average Australian takes for granted&mdash;water, and that means clean water; housing, and that means appropriate housing designed by the people themselves; sewerage and electricity'. They are things that people in the electorates of most of the members here take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need to improve environmental health factors has been addressed in great detail in the Federal Government's national Aboriginal health strategy, and substantial funds have been set aside to build dams and upgrade sewerage systems in remote communities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to participate in this Address-in-Reply debate and join my ALP colleagues in extending my congratulations to the new honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) on his maiden speech in the House today. I look forward to joining with him and other members of the Government in what I hope will continue to be a cooperative arrangement to try to address some of Australia's major problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Address-in-Reply debate has been dominated by a focus on two packages: the Governor-General's speech and the Opposition's Fightback package. Fightback was never intended to be a part of this debate, but it has been dragged in by government members misrepresenting the Opposition' policy at the election on 13 March. Without reflecting on the Governor-General, his speech was delivered to a less than interested audience in the Senate chamber. It was a lengthy speech that alphabetically unfolded what the Government saw as the steps that Australia and Australians would have to take during the term of the Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy is that much of that package offered nothing new, nothing exciting, nothing to turn Australians on and have them believe that the Government had a sense of direction and a sense of purpose. In fact, the initiatives outlined in the Governor-General's speech were initiatives that had already been carefully plucked from the Opposition's Fightback package and in one way or another threaded in to the Governor-General's speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take up the honourable member's interjection. I did not suggest that the Governor-General's speech was Fightback revisited but much of it contained the things that we had proposed, particularly in the area of industrial relations and enterprise bargaining, and ought to be adopted by the Government. By comparison, I would point out that the Fightback package has, in the debate before the House, been largely misrepresented by honourable members opposite. What the Opposition took to the people on 13 March was a package that, far from being uncertain in its course, far from making direction, was detailed, objective and honest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that some of the frank things that we said to the people of Australia, some of that honest approach, cost us the opportunity to be in government. Nonetheless the truth remains that the people of Australia had in the Fightback package a far more detailed, purposeful, courageous vista of what would happen to the nation under us than they enjoyed from the ALP going into the 13 March poll or glimpsed in any sense in the Governor-General's Speech which we are debating this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what Fightback did in the face of the misrepresentation from those opposite. Much has been made of the goods and services tax; I suppose that is inevitable. But no-one opposite has been prepared to acknowledge the simple, unchallengeable truth that under a GST the proposal was to ensure that people who currently evaded tax were obliged to pay tax. I would have thought that was a very equitable step to take. Nor has anyone acknowledged the fact that under this package the more we consume, the more we pay. I would have thought that was an act of equity almost appealing enough to be endorsed by a socialist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one has acknowledged that in an effort to redress the problems of those facing the most difficult time in Australia, the Opposition proposed, among many things, to double the family allowance and to increase pensions. At no time has there been any acknowledgment from any honourable member opposite of those areas of the Fightback package that were deliberately designed simply to advantage those Australians who are currently disadvantaged; nor has there been any recognition of those areas of the Fightback package that were deliberately designed to ensure that those who could pay did pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I invite honourable members to take as an example the Opposition's health package. It has been frequently misrepresented by the Government in this debate but, in reality, the Opposition's proposal for private health insurance ensured not only that those on low incomes could remain part of the existing health scheme but, even more dramatically and ignored by the Government, that those on high incomes would be obliged to pay a levy if they were not prepared to be privately insured. That is a statement of social justice and social equity put together by the Opposition and not acknowledged by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that the previous speaker from the Opposition, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), very clearly outlined what the Opposition has been about. Because I was in my office I only heard snippets of what he had to say, but I heard him clearly spell out what had been the policy of the coalition parties in the past in the areas of social security, immigration, health, and the introduction&mdash;as the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) knows&mdash;of the family allowance, and other social and family initiatives of which we ought to be justly proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout this debate there has been no recognition opposite of the role of the Opposition when in government in trying to ensure that there was a social balance in Australia. In fact, if one were to listen to this debate without having any of the facts and had not had the opportunity to hear the member for Menzies, one would have presumed that all sense of social justice and all sense of compassion were vested in the ALP.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That makes me angry because that is a gross misrepresentation of what this Parliament has been about and a gross misrepresentation of what my party and the coalition have been about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are expected to sit here and swallow this day in and day out in the face of the grim, inescapable truth that one million Australians are out of work under an ALP Government. Is that social justice? Is there any sense of apology opposite for the very policies that created and accelerated that unemployment level? Of course not. Is there any recognition in the Governor-General's speech of the fact that the attitude of this Government, particularly in the interest rate area, had caused small businesses to be crippled and unemployment rates to grow? Of course not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there any recognition of the fact outlined in a report of the Bureau of Census and Statistics of 15 April 1992, which showed that a total of 41.1 per cent of Australians had a yearly income of $12,000 or less? We all ought to be ashamed of that, but particularly the Government. It has been in power for a decade; this is what it has inherited. And it parades social justice and compassion!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there any recognition in the Governor-General's speech of the real injustice in economic terms currently facing every rural Australian and every farmer? Let me not fall into the same trap as the majority of speakers opposite and paint the picture that the Government has done nothing. That would be quite unfair. Only in the last fortnight the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) announced a $48 million package specifically designed to help the wool industry. The Opposition, the National Farmers Federation and woolgrowers around Australia applaud that and are grateful for it. But in terms of social justice, what has it really done? It still left the burden for paying that debt squarely with woolgrowers. It has pushed off the debt from a seven-year to an eight-year repayment program, but it does not really address the real social injustice of saying to my farmers, `Because of your assets you will be denied the sort of benefits that go to people who haven't got those assets.' I find that scandalous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent farmers who have large assets&mdash;rapidly falling in value, I might add&mdash;that are producing nothing. In fact, the average woolgrower will this year have a negative income of $30,000. Surely in the name of social equity he or she ought to be entitled to the same sorts of benefits as those who have an income of zero <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">because they are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government is to claim this monopoly on social justice and compassion&mdash;which a little later I intend to further destroy&mdash;let it, if you will pardon the pun, put its money where its mouth is. Any one of my farmers could sell up and dispose of what is currently productive and, because of the world-wide uneconomic property scene, buy a house in the electorate of the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and qualify for those benefits. Is that justice? I put it to the House that obviously it is not. In the light of a 30 per cent fall in profitability across all of rural Australia&mdash;40 per cent in the case of rice growers, particularly those in northern New South Wales currently plagued by drought&mdash;I think the Government should look again at what it does for rural Australians. Certainly it did not look again in the Governor-General's speech, as has been clearly pointed out by members of the Opposition and both the Liberal and National parties in previous speeches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am affronted by the claim that comes from the Government benches that only people on that side of the House know what compassion is all about, leaving the impression that people on this side of the House have no real feeling for suffering people in Australia at all. If we look at the word `compassion'&mdash;which, after all, has been used so frequently by those opposite, and used in such a critical tone when directed at the Opposition&mdash;we find that the word `compassion' is derived from two Latin words, `com' and `pati' which, translated, mean `to suffer with'. There is not one parliamentarian in the Federal Parliament of Australia&mdash;Liberal, Labor, National Party or Independent&mdash;who could claim on that score in party terms to be compassionate. No one of us could claim that we are suffering with those Australians who are currently out of work or with those rural Australians who are currently facing negative incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that the Government has not endeavoured to be compassionate, but let no-one in this House claim to have a monopoly on compassion because, until someone in this House comes in here resembling Mother Teresa, he or she will be misleading the Parliament. How can we be compassionate with someone else's money? If any one of us chooses to dispose of our lifestyle and live the sort of lifestyle that means we totally identify with those who are suffering, then we can claim to be compassionate, but I have not been prepared to do it, and I have not had particular evidence of anyone else doing it either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So my claim to the ALP is this: given the evidence offered by the honourable member for Menzies, which indicated that red-blooded human beings concerned for fellow Australians happen to reside on both sides of the Parliament and happen to be deeply rooted in both political philosophies espoused in this place, no one of us should claim to be compassionate unless we are prepared to dispose of all that we have. It is not possible for a party, Liberal or Labor, to claim to be compassionate with what are effectively other people's resources. All that we do in this place is try equitably to spread resources around, equitably to offer assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) in a speech which, as I indicated, is a maiden speech he can be proud of, wanted to suggest that we know nothing about the suffering that occurs in Aboriginal communities. I think that the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs and every member of the Opposition currently on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs ought to be affronted by that as well. We know something about suffering, and it is true that in Fightback we proposed to prune that budget, but we proposed to prune all budgets because we were concerned for the direction the nation is taking and for the level of taxpayer burden currently being borne, particularly by business. So, in the interests of the total nation's future profitability, we proposed to prune budgets, were they in Aboriginal affairs or the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the credit of the Opposition, whether we were right or wrong, we said so before the poll. We made it perfectly clear to the people of Australia what we would do and, in a decade in this place, the last two years have been the proudest two years of my life because I had a package that I could take to the people of Australia which I knew was not deceitful, which I knew had unpopular aspects to it, and which I was determined to sell. </PARA>

Responsibility for this victory is shared by many people and many groups, but overwhelmingly credit is due to the predominant leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Despite the best efforts of the media and our conservative opponents to paint him as arrogant or out of touch, the Prime Minister demonstrated a much greater understanding and feel for the mood and desires of the electorate.

It simply was not the case that they were too honest. The fact was that they could not fully explain the impact of their package; they were not able to come out and explain in detail how their package would affect Australians. They tried to hide behind the fact that this was a great big package, and that the package had to be accepted as a whole. Australian voters understandably said, `I'm sorry, but we don't like a lot of the impacts of this package, we aren't sure about what some of it means and we are just not prepared to trust you with it'. It was because they were not prepared to accept a radical and hard right wing agenda that the Liberals had to offer that the Australian people rejected the coalition on 13 March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are plenty of reasons why voters should have been, and probably would have been, prepared to decide that Labor had had its chance and that the other side needed a go. The circumstances were certainly there for the Opposition to win the election, but the Liberals blew it, and they blew it very badly. They thought that if they came up with this detailed and complex agenda with dramatic changes it would capture the imagination of the people and they would say, `Yes, we will take that, it looks fantastic. It is so detailed it must be good'. The Australian people did, initially, respond quite positively to it, because at the time we were in considerable economic difficulties and they thought that any change is better than what is happening at the moment. Unfortunately, the Liberal Party was sucked in by this initial response and it thought that everything would be rosy in the garden. The electorate did not like what the Liberal Party had to offer, so it thought it would have to go out and work harder at selling it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But once the Australian people started reading the fine print and going through what each and every element of that complex package meant, they woke up to the fact that everything was not going to be as rosy in the garden as the Leader of the Opposition was prepared to present it, and that compounded the Liberal's failure once more to truly understand the mood, desires and wants of the Australian people. Basically, Australians are a fair, easygoing and reasonable group of people. They like our egalitarian way of life, they believe in a fair go for everyone, and they want to help those who they believe need it. They do not like bludgers and whingers, and they certainly do not like people who get beyond themselves and think that they are better than others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister very successfully tapped into this fundamental Australian philosophy and highlighted throughout the campaign how the Opposition's policy agenda would attack this Australian way of life. The Liberals' plan to restructure the tax base through their inequitable goods and services tax, their plan to destroy awards and minimum working conditions, their desire to wreck Medicare and their proposal to slash some $10 billion from social welfare programs all constituted a massive assault on the lifestyle, living standards and quality of life that most Australians enjoy and want to maintain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defeat of the coalition on 13 March means that this hard, rationalist, right wing agenda&mdash;which had been developing gradually over the past decade and came together in this one package called Fightback&mdash;has been firmly and convincingly disposed of into the dustbin of history by the Australian electorate. Australian politics has now turned the corner. Our Government, working with the whole Australian community, now has a new vista of opportunities and challenges ahead in shaping and directing our structures and institutions in a uniquely Australian way. The electors on 13 March rejected the borrowed and failed economic and social agendas from Britain or America. They upheld their belief in fairness, equity, social justice and an Australian egalitarian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decade ahead will be one of considerable new economic growth for Australia, expanding trade opportunities and progressive reform and growth in employment and training. It will also give us the opportunity to improve dramatically living standards, quality of life, and educational and employment opportunities, and give legal recognition to the original owners and inhabitants of this continent&mdash;the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court decision on the Mabo claim has laid the foundation for Australia's institutions and authorities, as well as our population, to finally give the recognition and entitlements that our indigenous people demand and deserve. In his opening address in this Parliament, the Governor-General outlined the principles and policy objectives that will be followed by the Government in the next three years. As the Governor-General stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to the view that the Mabo decision presents us with a genuine basis for reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Mabo decision goes to the core of the issue: dispossession.</PARA>

<PARA>Labor's re-election and our commitment to a fair, just and equitable society makes it absolutely critical that we respond to the Mabo decision with care and without undue haste. The High Court last year finally ended a 200-year-old legal fiction. Our duty is to accede to this new wisdom and give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people justice at last. We should now give effect to the reasonable proposals of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to gain the equivalent of royalties for any mineral development on their lands; to have the right of veto on any further mining exploration or development on their original lands; and to see the establishment of a land acquisition fund to assist those who have been, and will continue to be, dispossessed. This is what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people believe is a fair and reasonable response to Mabo and it is also what my party's policy, as contained in our federal platform, recommends. </PARA>

This is part and parcel of the democratic process, and I accept and encourage it. In this election, Moreton was targeted by many organisations such as the Wilderness Society, the gun lobby, Right to Life, the nursing home industry, self-funded retirees, the AMA and many other groups across the whole political spectrum. One group, however, stands out above all others in the manner, content and ferocity of its campaign. I speak of the Housing Industry Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make my position quite clear. I do not seek to deny any individual or group the right to pursue its legitimate political views within our democratic process. I am a strong advocate of this principle. Nor am I one to seek retribution against anyone because of the exercise of that right. However, it is clear that there are, and should be, certain conditions applicable to that process. Vigorous debate and expression of views does not include slander, massive distortions, abuse of power and position, or vicious personal innuendo and attack. The HIA was guilty of all of this in its campaign of lies, smear and personal abuse in the campaign for Moreton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was present in the chamber last week when my new colleague the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) made his impressive debut in this House. I listened with interest and agreement as he outlined his views about the HIA and the way it conducted its campaign in his electorate. I can only agree with the assessment of the HIA Executive Director, Dr Ron Silberberg, as a person without integrity, honesty or intellect. Dr Silberberg was the mastermind behind his organisation's campaign and is guilty of a massive waste of his members' funds, abuse of power and position, and destruction of the effectiveness and influence of his organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within this context, I wish to take issue with the comments of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) contained in an article he authored which appeared in the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of 9 May 1993. I should also add that I advised the honourable member that I would be making these comments this evening. The honourable member for Bennelong claimed in his article that the HIA had now become the victim of a process of pay-back by the Government because it dared to campaign against Labor at the 13 March election. His article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government is engaged in squalidly validating that old maxim of `Spoils to the victors and woe to the vanquished'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sections of the community which campaigned against the Labor Party are being victimised because of their pre-election stance.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Bennelong is once more guilty of the same distortions and misrepresentations for which the HIA has become infamous. There is no campaign of retribution or victimisation. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry campaigned actively on behalf of the coalition. The Australian Medical Association did likewise. The mining industry, the small business sector, the chairman of Woolworths, other large retailers and sectors of the banking and finance industry all advocated coalition policies and urged their support. Despite these election activities, these groups still enjoy access to the Government and participation in the policy process because they engaged in vigorous debate, but they did it honestly, openly and in an up-front manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Housing Industry Association stands alone. Mr Silverberg and his Queensland director, Warwick Temby, spent millions of dollars spreading the most vicious package of propaganda I have ever seen in 21 years of active campaigning at all levels of government in Australia. Their campaign was based on a falsehood concerning the alleged impact of the subcontractor amendments to the industrial relations legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is patently clear from the HIA campaign that its organisation and its henchmen, Silverberg and Temby, are more interested in protecting the fraudulent and shonky activities of some of its members than properly advocating the best interests of the housing industry. The HIA wants to continue the practice of exploiting subcontractors and workers in the housing sector and it will use any device to advance that aim. The HIA is the rip-off merchant, and all buyers should be warned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legitimate and scrupulous housing industry companies who still belong to the HIA have started to understand that membership of that organisation smears them with the tawdry reputation of being sharks and shysters. Any company that still belongs to the HIA has had its reputation fatally damaged by the activities of the senior executives of the HIA. Other organisations with membership in the housing industry, such as the Master Builders Association and the Australian Confederation of Commerce and Industry, have very clearly and deliberately distanced themselves from the political activities of the HIA. They wanted no part of its campaign of lies and misrepresentations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for this reason that the Government has reassessed its relationship with the HIA. This group no longer represents a credible, representative organisation within the housing industry which speaks with integrity and credibility on behalf of this vital sector of our economy.

Too often we forget that we have an orchestra playing to us. Sometimes we are not always led by the beat but it is not their fault, and I think we should place that on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are here today to reply to the Governor-General's speech to the 37th Parliament, and in doing that I think we have to look at our system of constitutional monarchy. I do not in any way credit the Governor-General with the preparation of his speech because I believe&mdash;as everybody else would believe&mdash;that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is the architect of that speech. The system demonstrates, as I indicated, with the continuity of those people in office that under our system an ordinary man, a man who in his younger days was a policeman, brought up in Queensland, can aspire to and gain the office of Governor-General. That speaks a lot for a system that we sometimes attack too much; sometimes we do not take on board the positives. Australia is a constitutional monarchy and I wanted to pay my respects to those continuing elements of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the 37th Parliament and the result of a national poll on 13 March. Every three years our democratic system allows us to go to the people to let them have a say in who are to be their representatives. I am very pleased to be commencing my eighth period as a representative in this place. It was an opportunity for people to cast their votes, and they have done so. I am not going to suggest that the people of Australia got it wrong, but I wonder at times about the manner in which people were driven to the decision they made on 13 March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very timely that I should speak after the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson). He is known to be a trade unionist; he is a former member of the teachers union. I want to spend some time indicating the union involvement in the last election. Others would be able to add to this list but within my own division there were people from the nurses union, the teachers union, the seamen's unions, all the craft and public sector unions, who obviously and very determinedly organised against the conservatives and espoused the views of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We realise, of course, that for the period in which the election is held the official duties of unionists are put on hold while they campaign for the Labor Party. Maybe this is the type of system that we have to expect. But there seems to me to be a lack of democracy in this system where the union itself is involved with many unionists who pay their fees and levies, only to see them directed to the cause and interests of a party which is against their own affiliations. So I believe that there is some need to question the democracy that prevails in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the ACTU alone spent $10 million. It has been estimated that the other unions spent another $20 million, a total expenditure of $30 million in the interests of the Labor Party. One has to ask: where is the democracy for the ordinary, normal worker and unionist? Where is their money going? Is it a payback or a pay forward for privileges yet to be received from the government of the day? In that respect it is easy enough to indicate that millions of dollars were given to union movements by this Government, by the taxpayers of Australia, leading up to that election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about the taxation burden in this country there is obviously one privileged class in Australia who are not taxpayers, and that is the union movement. It is allowed to accumulate huge amounts of tax free money to be used for or against the interests of a political situation. I believe that we should be looking at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect is the non-accountability of unions. A few years ago&mdash;I do not believe the situation has changed&mdash;a union, compared with a company operating in the commercial field, would be subject to the regulations of an Act which were about an inch thick: pages and pages of declarations and documents relating to accountability. The last union statement I saw filled one page; it might have gone over to the second page for the auditor's comment, but I do not know if the auditor's comment was there. I do believe that there is something wrong with a system that allows unions to participate so much in the democratic process when they are a privileged group living outside the democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moreton made allegations in connection with the Housing Industry Association. I will come back to that later, but at this stage I would like to pick up his theme of lies and distortions. If the honourable member for Moreton is offended by the lies and distortions, he ought to have been on our side of the fence and seen the deliberate lies and distortions that were flashed over the media, in the press and in statements. If those statements had been made by a competitive commercial enterprise trying to get a market from the public of Australia&mdash;as the Labor Party was trying to do by getting the people's vote&mdash;it could have been charged, gaoled or fined tremendous amounts of money under the Trade Practices Act on the basis of its lies, distortions and misleading of the public. In many cases, it could have led to libel and slander charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this 37th Parliament should take stock of itself and realise that our political system that permits those things to happen is the laughing stock of the whole of Australia and the rest of the world. It is rather interesting that before an advertisement can be screened it is subject to vetting by an organisation called FACTS. But FACTS does not look at the facts, does not try to assess lies, distortions and facts, in advertisements. We would take a better hold of democracy and the whole electoral process&mdash;the honourable member for Moreton has suggested there were lies and distortions in respect of one set of conditions and I can certainly verify that within my electorate there were lies and distortions&mdash;if we had a look at the Electoral Act so that we were put into the mainframe and compared with Australian businesses around the country and so that what we promote as advertisements are put forward as true and factual, and not misleading as is now the case. I am not saying that people got it wrong. What I am saying is that people deserve the Government they get. They have a Labor government again for the next three years. But that Government is filled with a lot of union and minority interests and is not serving the majority interests of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Governor-General's address referred to a heightened sense of nationhood. With all due respect, I would have thought that nationhood was predominant in the minds of the early pioneers. Nationhood was very predominant in the minds of those people who put together the Constitution of 1901. It is very interesting to consider the comments of the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, who argues that the constitutional monarchy has a very large part of republicanism built into it. So we are being served as a monarchy and a republic under the one Constitution. The Governor-General's speech suggests that only in 1993 are we getting a heightened sense of nationhood when we are the product of the Constitution of 1901. People have gone to wars to defend that nationhood. We have a younger generation of sporting, community and industry achievers. It is misleading to suggest that they do not have a heightened sense of nationhood and are not trying to build on it. It is misleading to suggest that we never had it and that we should be striving towards it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not make the mistake of suggesting we have no sense of nationhood. I refer here particularly to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) when he said that we should not have an anti-British hatred born out of the Irish abuses of a century and a half ago. I have also read history, and I am not proud of what happened in Ireland in the mid-1800s during the potato famine and things like that. But to now build our nationhood on prejudices which are a century and a half old is not really looking at the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the argument that we should remove British ties. I put it to the House that all ties with our mother country&mdash;if you want to call it that&mdash;were lost in 1986. That was the last separation of the powers and control that the British Government and people had over us. There has been a tendency since the 1960s to diminish our trade and dependence on Britain in many ways. Britain is further divorced from us at the moment than it ever was: it is more closely allied to the European Community than it is to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that we have to break British ties again defies history. Our whole Constitution is built on common law. Our political practice is built on Westminster practices. If the argument is that the monarchy has failed us, I would ask people within Australia to accept the suggestion that it is not the monarchy that has failed us but that we have failed the monarchy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give the example to this Parliament of Question Time. It has been abused. It is a Question Time without answers. It is a Question Time with prepared statements. It is a Question Time of delivering a political harangue against us or someone else. It is not a Question Time where people can try to expose and get answers to the fundamental problems facing Australia at the moment. It is being reduced to a political exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that worries me is that we are having legislation introduced into this House at the moment not by the Minister responsible but by the Minister at the table, who would not know what he is reading and who has no empathy for the legislation and puts it out of context. There is no ministerial responsibility in that respect. Legislation flows from the pen of the draftsman, probably through the Minister's office, and it lands in this House for debate as though it is a foregone conclusion with the Minister taking very little interest. Very seldom do we find a Minister who takes the responsibility of listening to the debate. I pay tribute to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean): at least he is here during a relevant debate, listening to it and suffering the consequences of the Government's guillotine because he cannot reply to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to another point. The application of the guillotine is an abrogation of the democracy that we should be exercising in this House. Again, I say that this Parliament is failing the constitutional monarchy, it is failing the Westminster system, while we let the dictates go in one direction. If we have a look at the Ministers, the Parliamentary Secretaries, the Whips, the Speaker and the Deputy Speakers, we will see that this House is controlled by 40 per cent of people appointed by the Prime Minister. I know how the Caucus works&mdash;and I am not suggesting that they are all mates of the Prime Minister&mdash;but we have a clear-cut indication by that 40 per cent support that anything coming into this House is already predestined. Are we here as an open, democratic society for the people of Australia or to serve the purposes of a Prime Minister who is in his position because of the dictates of the union?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other honourable members might have come across a determined effort&mdash;there was in my last election by an organisation called the Confederate Action Party&mdash;for a citizens' initiated referendum. I can understand their frustration. We are getting so many laws, the external powers provisions are being used&mdash;not by this Parliament but by the leaders of this country&mdash;and we are abrogating our responsibilities overseas. These people want a referendum cast every time a certain matter comes before the House in which there is only a 10 per cent petition for that referendum. It is hopeless to try to govern under those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not be spending money looking at a republic&mdash;a dictatorship, a republic, a monarchy, a union, whatever it is called. If the country is going downhill it will be selling bananas as a third-rate country whether it is a republic, a monarchy or a dictatorship. What is required to bring us into the year 2000 is some discipline on this Parliament. I have already exposed the means by which we have moved away from the democratic principles of the Westminster system. If we were to subject our Constitution to just one change&mdash;that the government of this country in any one year should not be allowed to have other than a balanced or surplus Budget&mdash;that would be the greatest discipline on this House. It would be a discipline on expenditure. It would make sure that government expenditure was not being allocated to fringe groups and minority groups from whom support is called back at election time. It would make the government deal with a proposition in 12 months in just the same way as does any outside commercial enterprise. If we could just make that one alteration, it would be a great improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have failed the monarchy; the people of Australia have failed the monarchy. The monarchy has not failed us. We should not be spending millions of dollars on a grand new plan and scheme. Ordinary Australians are living in poverty. Those in the rural industry&mdash;the country people, the people in business out there&mdash;are living as unequal citizens of this country. They are a lower class. They are the new poor. While they continue to live like that, the Government is spending money on looking at ways and means of changing our system. A Government Minister the other morning mentioned the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS>. This is just like shifting chairs on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS>. The country is going downhill. We are not addressing the matters we should be addressing. We should be addressing the problems of those people who are living in poverty, people who are pioneers and proud to be contributing to Australia, those people whose businesses are going downhill. We, as conservatives, failed those people by not getting into government, because some of them have lost that last amount of hope they held in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got to give some government and some hope to the families of this country. They are the de jure families that have for so many years been part of the British tradition, the European tradition and the Asian tradition that is breaking down day by day. We have as a parliament to look at the concerns of those genuinely unemployed and try to give them jobs&mdash;not make-believe jobs; not give them handouts which we cannot afford under our system. We have got to be giving those people hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I must say that since 1975 I have not experienced an election in which good people&mdash;people who were struggling, who were determined to maintain those values of the family and of business, of what is called the old WASP work ethic&mdash;have wanted to contribute of themselves to try to salvage a situation. Because they had no funds to contribute, they contributed of themselves. I am disappointed that the conservatives, while they might have won the battle, have lost the war. But I believe that we have got to put those things in the past, as we should put the Irish famine and other anti-British sentiments in the past, and say that this 37th Parliament is for all the people of Australia, not just one or two, and it behoves us together to operate for the benefit of all Australians. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in this Address-in-Reply debate. It has been an interesting debate. I was listening to the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) talking about this Parliament, the performance of this Parliament and how it is judged by the Australian people. Like the member for Dawson, I have seen in operation other parliaments in other parts of the world, and I would put it to the honourable member for Dawson that we are no better or worse than many parliaments in the world. In fact, I think we are somewhat better. It is a vigorous parliament; we do debate vigorously because we passionately believe in many of the issues we argue about. It has been many years since punches were actually exchanged. It has never happened in this chamber; there has been no assault.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently saw a television special on the Japanese Parliament, where it took two days to vote. I saw a television report of a ruckus in the Korean Parliament. I think many of us saw what happened recently in the Italian Parliament. I make no criticism of those countries. Nevertheless I think that, on a world pendulum, the members of this Parliament might turn out to be fairly tame. Things have changed somewhat since Parliament has been televised. But a lot of my colleagues on the other side are always telling me about letters they receive from their constituents about the performance in parliament. In 10 years in this place, I have only ever received one letter from a constituent complaining about a performance in Parliament. Mr Deputy Speaker, it was during a period when I occupied the position you are now occupying. The constituent was critical of a ruling I gave&mdash;or did not give; the constituent wanted me to throw someone out. That is the only such letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether the people I represent are different from other people but I am not getting an avalanche of letters. When I go out to social functions and sporting functions and go around the shopping centres in my electorate the main issue that people raise with me is not the performance of parliament. The performance of parliament is very interesting. We often hear that people come in here and they leave, saying, `They are like a bunch of schoolkids. We would not perform like that'. When I am sitting in the chair, I often look in the gallery. The average time people stay in the gallery is only 10 to 20 minutes. Many people expect us to sit here for 14 to 16 hours, diligently listening to every debate. I was in the chair during much of the debate on the Gulf War. Even at that period the average time people stayed in the gallery was only 20 minutes. That may have been because of the quality of the debate; it might have been too boring for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject the idea that this Parliament needs more discipline. I think overall we are a fairly disciplined parliament. We are not as bad as many people may think. Perhaps people in the community have too high expectations of us. We are rather an ordinary group of people but we represent in the Parliament the cross-section of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be in the Parliament again, having survived my fifth election. This, in many respects, was quite difficult in that for the first time I had about nine people standing against me. Most of them lost their deposit, which I was quite pleased about; it is everyone's democratic right to lose a deposit in a campaign. The fact that I now have the second safest seat in Australia does not mean that I will rest on my laurels. As I said to the people of Throsby, I will work as diligently as if I had the most marginal seat in Australia. It is interesting in a democratic society to see the number of people that elections bring out of the woodwork. I had one gentleman standing against me whose name was Zero Population Growth. He represented the party Australians Against Further Immigration. It was quite interesting that this person stood against me in one of the most ethnically diverse areas in Australia and thought that he could be elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the new members on their first speeches and look forward to the contribution that I know they will make in this Parliament. I especially thank the people of Throsby for returning me to the House once more. Indeed, the people of the Illawarra gave the Australian Labor Party a tremendous vote of confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to hear what the honourable member for Dawson said about the involvement of the trade union movement. I am a life-long trade unionist, and every year I continue to take out my trade union ticket. I make no apology for the involvement of the trade unions: they helped me. The Australian Workers Union, the Miscellaneous Workers Union, the Seamen's Union and the various other unions contributed to my campaign. But let us not be one-eyed about this. The small business community did not contribute to my campaign, and the many people who contributed to the conservative side of Australian politics did not contribute to my campaign. McDonald's donated all their advertising space for the period of the election in the electorates of Hughes, Cunningham, Throsby and Gilmore to the Liberal candidates. I will be carefully watching the returns that all honourable members are obliged to put in and checking that McDonalds identifies those donations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us not get too carried away with who the trade unions supported because big business, including the housing industry and many others, certainly did not support the Australian Labor Party. The honourable member spoke about paybacks or pay forwards; that may or may not be the case, but it is the same for those opposite. Big business would not be supporting the conservatives unless it thought it would be getting something. G.J. Coles, for example, contributed very mightily to the conservative party, and it expected to get a payback from that contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member mentioned that the union movement does not have to pay taxes. Another group in this country, the churches, does not pay taxes on the property it owns. The churches do not even have to pay local rates. So if honourable members are going to come into this place and point the finger at the trade union movement, let us use all our fingers and point them fairly widely at who pays taxes and who does not. Personally, I believe that any business, whether a trade union, a church or whatever, should pay its dues, its taxes and its local rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased that in the Governor-General's speech&mdash;a very long speech; I make no other comment about it&mdash;that the question of Australia as a republic was raised. I make no secret of the fact that I support the movement for Australia to become a republic. I hope that the debate&mdash;there will be a debate, as there should be on this matter&mdash;will not be a divisive one, although I fear it will be. Many of my friends are British, so it is not a question, as the honourable member for Dawson says, of whether the monarchy has failed us or whether we have failed the monarchy; in many respects, it is not even a question about the monarchy. We have respect for Her Majesty the Queen as the Queen of England; there is no argument about that. I have respect for her, but it is a question of Australian identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People talk about the heightened feeling of Australian nationhood. We have always had a heightened feeling of Australian nationhood. Last night I attended a movie in the auditorium upstairs, and a 1930s newsreel was shown. It was filmed on an Australia Day in either 1936 or 1937, and it said Australia was British and always would be British. Everyone present laughed. We are not British: we are Australian. We are a multicultural society, but we are Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I lived in Britain for 11 years. I have two university degrees from British universities. Many of my friends are British. I go to Britain every second year&mdash;some say every year&mdash;because many of my friends are still there. Many of my formative years were spent at university in Britain. I am very proud of the two degrees that I hold from British universities, including one from the London School of Economics and Political Science. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I like the trains; I like many things about Britain. But we are talking about Australia and its sense of identity. People talk about the framers of the Constitution and those who went to war. No-one is denying the contribution that they made or is denying their loyalty. We are saying that we are a constantly evolving society. The Australia of 1900 was very different from the Australia of 1800, and it will be a very different Australia in the year 2000. In this talk about a republic we are trying to reflect Australia as it currently is. I think that is the important issue. Australia is not a static society. I resent immensely people who suddenly say that Australia will become a dictatorship. Look at the republics in the world. Some of the most democratic societies in the world are republics. Why should it be any different in Australia? It will not be a dictatorship; it will be a republic. Whether the head of state is a president or whatever other name we like to call that person, it does not concern me greatly. But it does concern me that that person be Australian and reflect Australian values. That is the important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No one in this chamber or in our society has a monopoly on loyalty. I do not question the loyalty of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic. It does seem strange to me when they are touting how Australian they are that they want to pay allegiance to the head of another country, but I never question their loyalty. However, I resent it immensely when people question my loyalty for putting the view, as an Australian, that what I stand for is an Australia with an Australian head of state. I make the point that no one in this chamber or in the wider community has a monopoly on loyalty. We are and will continue to be an evolving society, and that is good. It is something that as a republic we would reflect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said in this debate about industrial relations. Representing, as I do, one of the great industrial centres of Australia, the Port Kembla area, including the port of Kembla, I have a vital interest in trade union matters. One of the major reasons why I believe the Opposition was rejected in the recent elections was the chaos it promised with its industrial relations proposals. To appease its rural supporters it targeted the waterfront. I have absolutely no doubt that if the conservatives had won at the last election they would have engaged in an almighty confrontation on the waterfront. I have absolutely no doubt they would have had the troops out on the waterfront&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You say, `Rubbish!', but I will tell you why I believe it. I said to my people at Port Kembla that if the conservatives win they have to prove their credentials. One of the credentials they want to prove concerns this fallacy that they go on with about the waterfront. They would have engineered an almighty blue on the waterfront and had the troops in. I have no doubt that they would have got in some of their thugs with a few greased pick handles, and there would have been mayhem on the waterfront. It always amazes me that people talk about the waterfront as though there have been no changes there over the last few years. No other area has been subjected to greater change than the waterfront. If anyone doubts that, I suggest that they read the report from the House of Representatives Transport, Communications and Infrastructure Committee&mdash;an all-party report&mdash;entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to wharf</EMPHASIS>. It deals with the various interlocking changes on the waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Victorian Kennett Government's so-called industrial relations reforms have understandably aroused controversy, a less well-known but equally significant struggle over workers' rights has been taking place in New South Wales. In September 1992, a small, non-violent picket at an obscure sewage treatment plant at Bombo, near Kiama on the south coast of New South Wales, resulted in criminal and quasi-criminal charges being laid against two union leaders. That raised questions about the right of unionists to peacefully picket during industrial disputes in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales, industrial relations has gone back to an obscure Act introduced in 1900&mdash;known as the Watching and Besetting Act. That has very serious ramifications, and not only for the trade union movement. In the past, trade union disputes have been dealt with in industrial relations courts. Now we have industrial disputes in New South Wales being taken to the criminal courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a basic right of any trade unionist or worker to picket. There is no law on any statute book in Australia that says that it is illegal for a worker to picket. As someone who has been on many pickets and involved in many demonstrations, I find the lack of a clearly defined right to peacefully protest in New South Wales of concern to all community groups and individuals. The capacity for the misuse and abuse of the considerable penal powers accumulated by the State, which can be used against any display of peaceful dissent, is disturbing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disturbing because the Fahey Government, in using this obscure Watching and Besetting industrial relations Act, can virtually accuse someone found looking at someone else of a criminal offence. The legislation could be applied to a mother's union or a conservation group or anyone walking down the street&mdash;or it could be applied to those environmentalists who are always protesting about trees being cut down. If they were looking at a tree that was about to be cut down, then under the law of New South Wales they could be charged with a criminal offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So great is the Fahey Government's hatred of the trade union movement that it will go to any lengths to make criminals out of trade unionists who going about their lawful and rightful duties. That is what it amounts to: the manic hatred that the conservatives&mdash;the people represented on the other side of this House, not that there are many of them here&mdash;have for the trade union movement. That is one of the reasons why the conservatives lost the last election. Trade unionists were not going to subject themselves to what they have seen happening in Victoria and New South Wales. They have seen it in Victoria and New South Wales and they are not going to see it happening throughout Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been in power for 10 years. From 1983 until the late 1980s, every government Minister&mdash;and there was no greater offender than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself, during his term as Treasurer&mdash;blamed the Fraser-Anthony Government for anything and everything that was wrong with the nation. For years and years the Government has played that game. It cannot hide behind that coward's shield any longer because it has held the reins of power for an uninterrupted 10 years. Everything about the nation's economy today, apart from the areas shaped by external influences, is entirely the responsibility of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to hear any of the mealy-mouthed cliches that are trotted out, particularly by a number of the ideologically narrow new members, about how the Labor Party has benefited the nation. I advise the Government to go and mix with the people. Who is giving the Government its advice? It is certainly not coming from practical small business people, working to keep their doors open. It is certainly not coming from the farmers, struggling to stay on the land. The Government certainly does not take advice from one income families, who are hit by a taxation system that discriminates against them. It certainly does not take advice from our exporters, weighed down with an array of costs, charges and waterfront inefficiencies that few other of their competitors have to suffer. The Government simply cannot escape its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it ironic, even tragic, that at a time when the Prime Minister is asking us to redefine our national identity&mdash;as if we do not know what it is already&mdash;and is talking about a new nationalism and the creation of a separate identity in our immediate part of the world, that he also speaks of newborn sovereignty. This nation does not have any sovereignty. We surrendered that by way of our foreign debt. What sovereignty does this nation have? We are totally in hock to international bankers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is talking about an independent nation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bradfield reminds me that gross it is, over $200 million. When we try to explain it, people say, `It is not my debt. It is of no concern to me'. The debt is roughly divided evenly between private and public sectors, but everybody in Australia pays it. If the debt has been incurred by a public utility, a statutory authority or a government, then people pay for it in higher costs and charges and higher taxes. The Government has to service its debt. In fact, 20 per cent of the Victorian Budget is in interest repayments alone for its debt. So it is paid for by water rates, land taxes and stamp duties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the private sector has incurred the debt, it is paid for by higher prices. If Elders has a mammoth foreign debt&mdash;which we know it does&mdash;it is paid for by higher beer prices. People in Australia cannot delude themselves that they are not paying through the nose for the foreign debt&mdash;a foreign debt incurred, firstly, by big spending governments and, secondly, by private companies. During the high interest rate period&mdash;between 1988 and 1991&mdash;some companies had no choice but to seek offshore borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another reason that I want to talk about sovereignty. This nation's sovereignty has been greatly compromised by the influence minority and unrepresentative groups often have over the Government. Let us take the timber industry, which I know well, given that my electorate of East Gippsland is heavily dependent on this industry. The Industry Commission has just put out a draft report on what is needed to make the timber industry in Australia an efficient and important industry, economically as well as socially. It has recommended three things, the first being resource security. This Government will not give resource security. We have introduced a private member's Bill which gives the framework, the precedent, upon which resource security can be given so as to provide the certainty of investment necessary to attract funding and expansion into the timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the report recommends that export controls be abolished. Export controls are a nonsense. Maintaining the balance, the sustainable harvest, should be at the point of entry into the forest. Export controls should not be used over, say, woodchips as a substitute for environmental policy. It is an absolute nonsense to have export controls retained by the Commonwealth. All it does is allow the Commonwealth to override a State which it believes, for political purposes, has not satisfied the extremist Green lobby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the report talks about corporatisation or privatisation of the States various forestry commissions and forest holdings, which also appeals to me enormously. We have enormous wastage in East Gippsland because the timber is just lying on the forest floor, which is extremely wasteful. It is either being burnt or is rotting. It presents a major fire hazard for Gippsland and the south-east corner of New South Wales. This timber could easily be earning income for a number of small towns in East Gippsland that are slowly but surely dying. That is one example of how the sovereignty of this nation has been compromised. I also worry about the fact that 26 per cent of Australia's total area is locked up against exploration and mining or subject to limited access restrictions, which is up 63 per cent since 1983 when Labor came to power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do we not establish some sovereignty, some independence and some true nationalism in real terms before the Government pursues, for its own political purposes, a minimalist position whereby the name Governor-General is substituted by the name President. There are far more pressing issues that have to do with our future as a nation than the mere tampering with titles, which the Prime Minister wants us to believe is all he seeks. But there is a very long way to go on that debate. I am sure the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) agrees with me that over a period the true agenda of the Prime Minister and his party will be revealed. </PARA>

If they do not think he is operating to a grand plan, the big picture as he states, or the self-style Placido Domingo of Australian politics, they have rocks in their head. If the Prime Minister  thinks that the coalition parties will sit idly by and surrender to him the future of this nation and all of its values and traditions, then he has another think coming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that he appeals for bipartisanship on this issue, but only now. Where has this appeal for bipartisanship on the issue of the republic been over the last six months or so? It is only now, as he is beginning to realise the dimensions of the problem that lies ahead of him, that he seeks bipartisanship. The Prime Minister will never seek bipartisanship unless he wants us to get him out of a hole that he has dug for himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time remaining to me, I wish to turn more specifically to the rural communities in Australia, which on so many fronts are becoming increasingly disenfranchised. Rural Australia is through with cheap talk from governments. It now faces an attack on its very existence, and it wants action; it will not settle for anything less. It has good reason to be tired of governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enduring agony of the bush has not arrived overnight. The compounding crises have been piled on top of one another in recent years. Long before anyone had heard of phrases such as structural adjustment, asset price collapses, productivity growth and international competitiveness, rural businesses, farms and country towns had been fighting problems year in year out for decades in the middle of the international ring. They were on the toughest arena imaginable. Our exporters, particularly farmers, have had little or no protection to assist them to deal on a corrupted trade market. So they, more than anyone, have had to engage, as the Government so cutely terms it, in structural adjustment and all of that. Faced with collapsing terms of trade, farmers did not shelter behind protection and assistance. They absorbed higher costs and went for improved productivity when no-one else had even considered the option, and well before economic commentators even started using the term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When interest rates hit the roof, the rural landscape suffered terribly&mdash;and it still does. For those who lived in rural towns there was no easy alternative. They could not shop at another mall around the corner or to go to some other service just down the street. Shops, machinery businesses and daily services all just disappeared. Today we are trying to fight for policies to feed into the public arena, to galvanise the Australian public and the Labor Government so that they will take action to help the rural community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, it is an unbelievable situation that we have to fight for these initiatives. Rural Australia is not a charity; it is an asset. It has powered economic growth for a century, and will continue to do so. A burgeoning regional economy drawing on a commodities market which fuels demand in the cities will always run like a backbone through the national economy. Some might talk about small, smart technology and intensive metropolitan businesses and point to the nation's economic salvation, but the reality of the Australian future will be forged in the traditional arena of the Australian countryside. That is where the main action will be. That is where it has always been and always will be into the future of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need policies for the times. We have to work harder than ever before to keep rural communities alive as viable, going concerns so that they can be revitalised and pull the nation out of recession. This Parliament has the abiding responsibility to resist efforts by those who would pull the pin on the rural economy at the first sign of trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This House can be assured that the National Party, together with its Liberal Party colleagues, will fight those who think that the community does not want the countryside to survive. We have to stand by rural and regional Australia in its darkest hours. If Canberra has no passion for the countryside, the wider community does, and if the Labor Government has no will to build a future for the agricultural sector, then the National Party has enough to go around for everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no greater example of the Government's failing of the rural sector than its policies in regard to wool. Last night the industry was canvassed at great length on the Wool Realisation Commission legislation. A number of my colleagues set out in great detail the irresponsibility and misjudgments on the part of the Government over the past few years that led to the collapse of the floor price, and its inaction following the collapse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government failed the woolgrowers of Australia in a number of ways. Firstly, it left the wool tax at 8.5 per cent. It should have suspended the 4.5 per cent debt repayment part of the wool tax. I understand that will only raise $100 million, and there is enough of the stockpile sales to cover the extra finance, on top of the $120 million already in hand, to cover the interest on the debt and storage charges. Secondly, the Government should have extended the Australian Wool Realisation Commission debt repayment for more than 12 months. The Government should not have put a time limit on the repayment schedule so that it would not matter whether it took five, 10 or 15 years to repay the debt. We have to signal to wool buyers that there will not be a fire sale so that the Wool Realisation Commission can meet its debt repayment schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We published the debt repayment schedule. Is not that a brilliant strategy&mdash;publish the debt repayment schedule so that all the buyers out there know each year how much money the Wool Realisation Commission has to pay to the Government and how desperate the commission will be to sell off part of the stockpile. That is part of the economic genius of this Government. We say that instead of just delaying the debt repayment for 12 months as the Government has done&mdash;and all that does is assure buyers that there will not be a fire sale for the next 12 months&mdash;we should have made it abundantly clear that the Wool Realisation Commission would not be pressured into a fire sale in the foreseeable future. So that was a serious failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third serious failure in regard to policy for woolgrowers was that the Government did not offer household support as a welfare payment to those farmers who were struggling but who wanted to remain on the land. All the Government offers is wholesale support which, as a loan, must be repaid. Rural Australia is on its knees. It needs a Government that understands the state of the rural economy and is determined to do something about it. I am afraid that in both cases the Government fails the test. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill is to authorise a contribution by Australia of $350 million to the 10th replenishment of the International Development Association. Australia has contributed to the previous nine IDA replenishments, the last being for $382.5 million in 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Development Association is a specialist United Nations agency affiliated with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, that is the World Bank, and the IDA is the World Bank's concessional lending arm. It aims to provide soft loans for major public development and infrastructure projects focussing on the poorest members of the association in the international community. Loan recipients have annual per capita GNPs of less than $US740.The IDA is funded by 22 economically advanced countries, including the United States, Japan, and most of the European Community. In the 10th replenishment the IDA will raise some $US18 billion from these donors together with another $US4 billion in loan repayments. Australia has been a member since the IDA's foundation in 1960. The International Development Association Act 1960 authorised the first Australian contribution and further contributions have been authorised by subsequent Acts passed every three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill the draw downs for the next three financial years are estimated at $9.4 million, $28.3 million, and $47 million respectively. This leaves some $265.3 million to be spent in the five to seven years thereafter, as I understand it. It must be noted that these figures could change because of fluctuations in exchange rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's contribution under this Bill will amount to about 1.46 per cent of IDA donor contributions, as opposed to 1.99 per cent in 1990. I understand the reasons for the reduction in that percentage and the Opposition has no criticism of that, for the Opposition supports the Bill. The IDA in our view is a key contributor to development in the poorest countries. It provides support for major public infrastructure projects. IDA loans are provided to governments only. As such, IDA loans are normally accompanied by policy dialogue with recipient countries and this dialogue can be of considerable influence in engendering reform in the economic policies of recipient countries, particularly in Africa. Australian participation, therefore, gives Australia some voice in this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contributions are, together with food aid, the major contributions that Australia makes to the poorer developing countries. This is frequently cited, of course, as an excuse for not giving more to low income countries. This line, in my view, is not seen as credible in the eyes of potential recipient countries and coalition policy has in fact been to favour increased priority for bilateral aid which achieves developmental benefits that are better targeted at specifically Australian objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's major concern with this Bill revolves around its implications for bilateral aid programs, namely the inflexibility that is brought to bear within a constrained budget and the extent to which it commits future governments over the next eight to 10 years. The proposed contributions have no direct implications for the overall budget as the amounts are normally found within the overall aid program. But in recent years the impact of the cuts in the global aid budget has fallen principally on the bilateral programs. This has happened because priority under this Government has been given to multilateral institutions such as the IDA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitments set out in the Bill do have the potential to lock Australia into such a pattern for the next eight to 10 years. Without reference to the forward estimates it is difficult to be sure of the precise quantitative effects of the commitments proposed in the Bill. It is clear, however, that it could reduce the ability of future governments within current budgetary restraints to redress the imbalance in the current global budget in favour of multilateral programs by giving increased priority to bilateral aid, food aid, and support for non-government organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that for IDA-10 the donors have set priorities which include increasing support for programs that are directly poverty related, support for programs for women, and emphasis on environmental sustainability. These were all points upon which the Opposition touched in debate on Australia's contribution in the last contributions to the IDA, that is, IDA-9. The key priority to reflect on for IDA-10 is the greater monitoring of recipient governments' non-development expenditures as a proportion of public spending to ensure that IDA loans are not de facto supporting, in particular, military programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition notes that the Government has taken up with the World Bank criticisms of IDA programs, in particular the focus of some programs and the high administrative costs of the World Bank. We agree that the Government should have done this and we would wish to see such vigilance continue. In the meantime overall, notwithstanding that criticism and particularly noting the changed priorities that have been set here, we are in favour of the Bill, as I indicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some who put forward a philosophic view to the contrary about the IDA. My concerns have generally revolved around unnecessary expenditure and some of the priorities not being correct. In this instance I congratulate the Government on its constraints on the aid budget which I assume, rather than a change of priorities, has necessitated a lesser percentage in terms of donor contributions, thus ensuring a change in priorities. The Government has taken up the latter point that I mentioned, namely, the high administrative costs that seem to be evident within the World Bank. As I say, the Opposition will not oppose the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill the Australian Parliament seems set to contribute another $350 million to an agency of the World Bank. This is just one of the many regular contributions that Australia makes to a variety of international financial institutions&mdash;the IFIs, as they are known&mdash;every year. We continue to make these contributions in a thoughtless way without giving serious consideration to the effectiveness of the assistance dispensed by these bodies or whether Australia's interests are best served by making these contributions. In these matters, we tend to blindly follow the international herd. It should be noted, however, that the contrast with the situation in the United States at present should be something of which we take some cognisance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States Congress currently has before it a Bill very similar to this one, which provides for a contribution to the International Development Association by the United States of some $US1.25 billion. That Bill is the subject of furious debate in the United States and, according to some reports, the Bill is unlikely to pass the United States Congress in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this furious debate, of the sort that we never see here in Australia, is that there is a growing realisation in the US that the International Development Association and its fellow members in the World Bank group are ineffective in realising their goals and are extremely inefficient in their own internal operations. Indeed, it was pleasing to see some long overdue recognition of this fact in the second reading speech of the Minister for Development Co-operation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney). The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of criticisms have been levelled at the World Bank over the last few years, some with justification. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a bit of an understatement. He went on to detail some of those problems and to claim that the Australian Government was putting pressure on the World Bank to lift its game on a number of different issues. However, what the Minister had to say in his second reading speech seriously understates the case against the World Bank and some of the other international financial institutions to which Australia regularly contributes. Indeed, if one is looking for some indicators for the World Bank's poor performance we need look no further than the annual report to the Parliament of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and the World Bank</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this is a regular report which tends to be a bit of a whitewash, the most recent one notes a sharp decline in the internal administrative efficiency of the World Bank, particularly in the case of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Assoication. The report notes that the loan and investment commitments per unit of administrative expenditure for the IBRD and the IDA have fallen from 100 in the base year of 1987 to only 85 in 1992. The report also notes a significant decline in World Bank project performance. The number of projects judged satisfactory has declined from an average of 72 per cent between 1987 and 1989 to only around 63 per cent in 1990 and 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is forever telling us in its reports that it is lobbying for improvements in the performance of the World Bank both in its project lending and in its own internal operations, but in all the years that the Government has been saying this there has been no visible improvement in the performance of the World Bank group&mdash;in fact, quite the opposite has occurred. This should hardly be surprising given the fact that the United States has had similar difficulties in bringing pressure to bear on the World Bank group, despite the fact that it is one of the biggest single shareholders with influence that far exceeds that of Australia in this context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that it is almost impossible for member countries to exert influence over the World Bank group and similar bodies because these institutions have their own capital with which they largely determine their own budgets. Organisations like the United Nations, the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs and the OECD by contrast have no funds of their own and are dependent on their member countries to supply them with a budget each year which is carefully scrutinised and voted on by member countries. But with the World Bank and similar bodies the shareholders make commitments of enormous amounts of capital every five years or so and thereby forsake any effective influence over these bodies. Let me remind the House that Australia is one of those shareholders.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And I will make the point a little bit in depth, too, with your permission, Mr Speaker. This table compares the pay, perks and some administrative quirks of those institutions with those found in other international organisations&mdash;namely, the United Nations, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the GATT. The table clearly shows the lack of discipline on the part of the international financial institutions compared with other international organisations within which Australia also plays a role and to which Australia obviously provides funds. It shows that the international financial institutions are better remunerated, less efficient, travel first or business class instead of economy and have the most lavish offices of all these international organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, the table shows that the only way in which the World Bank group might be disciplined is if shareholder countries were to tie their regular contributions to the group's capital to the performance of its various agencies. Of course, Australia rather stupidly does exactly the opposite of this. The Australian Government maintains that we must remain a substantial contributor to the bank if we are to have any influence&mdash;which of course ensures that we have absolutely no influence, because the World Bank knows that, no matter how abysmal its performance is, it will still get our regular contribution of capital. The Government puts forward this entirely circular and ridiculous argument that we should contribute to the World Bank because that will give us some influence over our contribution. The logic of that argument is that the more abysmally the World Bank group performs the more money we should give it so that we can better influence the bank's operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the World Bank's performance will continue to be unsatisfactory until we tie our contributions of capital directly to the performance of the World Bank group. That means scaling down or withholding our contribution at times until the World Bank group gets its house in order. It is worth recalling that it was only when Western governments began pulling out of UNESCO that that organisation began to behave in a half-decent way. Prior to that, UNESCO was an international disgrace that thumbed its nose at the Western governments which paid for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of discipline on the various international financial institutions was stunningly illustrated by the recent controversy over the extravagance of the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to which Australia also contributes. When the EBRD Bill was debated in this place in 1990, I warned that under the presidency of Mr Jacques Attali the EBRD would become a pleasure palace for international bureaucrats at the expense of Australian taxpayers, amongst others. Sure enough, that is exactly what has happened, but to the extent that no Australian taxpayer could have ever dreamed of in their worst nightmares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its first few years of operation the EBRD managed to spend twice as much on its own offices and staff than it spent on aid to eastern Europe, the reason for its creation. Over $120 million alone has been spent on furnishing and equipping its palatial offices in London. This included the purchasing of some 600 desks at around $1,000 each, designed by the architect Norman Foster. The offices are noted for their extensive use of marble which involved, at one stage, spending #750,000 replacing textured marble panels in the bank's foyer with smooth marble, apparently because the original marble panels were judged to be unsatisfactory. Other examples of extravagance include the #52,000 that was spent on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Christmas party last December&mdash;some knees-up that must have been&mdash;and the #600,000 spent on hiring private jets for Mr Attali in 1992 alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an enormous controversy about this extravagance in Europe and the United States. Republican and Democrat members of the US Congress have rightly been in uproar about this expenditure. But we do not hear a peep out of honourable members and senators who come into this place year after year to approve Australia's contributions to these organisations. Unless people read the nether regions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> with its reports taken from the wire services, no-one would ever hear about this controversy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the Assistant Treasurer, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), recently addressed the annual general meeting of the EBRD at the height of this controversy overseas. The Assistant Treasurer devoted four paragraphs of his five-page speech to the question of the EBRD's excesses. The strongest words that I could find in that speech were in the comment that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia strongly supports the need for restraint in the bank's administrative and capital expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>While it is necessary to observe all the usual diplomatic niceties, the Assistant Treasurer must realise that we need to be much more forthright than this in our criticisms of these bodies if we are not to be taken wholly for granted by these international bureaucrats. The Assistant Treasurer had an obligation to Australian taxpayers to deliver a stinging rebuke to the bank for its waste and extravagance. Instead, the Assistant Treasurer called on the bank `to identify more accurately the bank's core role'. He went on to say, `then and only then will . . . our critics be silenced'. Think about that. In saying this, he was effectively putting himself on the side of the bank&mdash;the EBRD&mdash;rather than representing the interests of Australian taxpayers to that body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer should have fronted up at that meeting and announced that Australia would no longer contribute to this extravagant body. That would have been a speech with real impact. In fact, if the Assistant Treasurer had wanted to be less diplomatic, he could have quoted what Stephen Bayley, the creator of London's Design Museum, had to say about the bank in the arts and architecture section of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">European</EMPHASIS>. Mr Bayley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The entire bank is an error of taste . . . a marvellously absurd Potemkin village, disguising a deeper absurdity: the hilarious misfit of glamorous and self-important French bureaucracy in London . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to observe, in reference to Mr Attali:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">French socialists have never assumed that it was necessary to be badly dressed, ill-fed&mdash;or even to be much of a socialist. In all its incongruous splendour, the EBRD is a perfect symbol of that conceit.</PARA>
<PARA>The extravagance of the EBRD has direct implications for the World Bank agencies, such as the International Development Association, in that there is a knock-on effect from all this lavishness. The other IFIs get jealous when they see the EBRD getting better pay and perks than they are and so they demand the same for themselves. It is the fat cat relativity argument that we all know so well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was most vividly illustrated by the effect of Mr Attali's unprecedented salary on the IMF and the World Bank. Mr Attali negotiated a salary of $US290,000 when he was appointed president of the EBRD in 1991. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Mr Michael Camdessus, was at the time receiving only $US225,000, so he had to demand a pay rise which took him to $US285,000. Of course, this meant that the World Bank president, Mr Lewis Preston, automatically received a similar increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While these salaries may not seem excessive at first glance, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> points out that when account is taken of their tax-free status and the fact that Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board receives only $US134,000 for his trouble, then we can see that we have some very well paid people indeed working for these organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be remembered that the generosity of these executive salaries inevitably flows on to the senior staff in these bodies who enjoy equally attractive conditions of employment. The propensity of World Bank and IMF staff to use Concorde and other forms of first-class air travel is well known, indeed notorious. An infamous World Bank internal staff memo of a few years ago claimed that a proposal by the director of the World Bank's health service that staff should travel business class would lead to an increase in what was called `post-mission travel-induced strokes'. I should not laugh and I apologise for doing so, but such is the delicate nature of World Bank staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, one could very easily come to the conclusion that the Government's enthusiasm for its contributions to these bodies is really only a reflection of the federal bureaucracy's enthusiasm for working for them. Postings with the IFIs are highly coveted among senior bureaucrats in Treasury and elsewhere. So it is not surprising that they might seek to con the Government into taking on a much bigger role in these bodies than our national interest justifies. This is also why it is futile to have federal bureaucrats review the performance of these organisations and participation within them, since they are effectively being asked to review their own future career prospects in some cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that Australia began to take its role in these bodies seriously, instead of turning our contributions to international financial institutions into an annual ritual with little or no debate. It is difficult to think of an area of government expenditure which receives as little scrutiny as our contributions to these organisations. If we were seriously concerned with assisting eastern Europe, for example, we would carefully evaluate the options available and act on them, instead of handing over money willy-nilly to an egotistical French bureaucrat to lavish on himself and his staff. Any such examination would probably come to the conclusion that the cause of development around the world is best met by private sector capital and not by the funds dispensed by the multilateral development banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian taxpayers should be up in arms about what is being done with their money and in their name by these organisations with the connivance of not just this Government, but successive Australian governments. The fact that they are not is a reflection of the dereliction of duty that occurs in this place every time one of these Bills comes up for debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not. But it is difficult to see from his speech that the Opposition is in fact supporting the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill. I am glad to see that it is, because I believe we have a duty, as a responsible international citizen, to contribute to the multilateral development organisations&mdash;not least the IDA, which is arguably amongst the most worthy of those institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not restate the arguments which were so ably put by the shadow Minister for foreign affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), but in the two minutes left to me I want to answer some of the criticisms that were made by the honourable member for Curtin. Most of those criticisms related to the EBRD. We have been rather more critical, and have taken rather more stern action, in respect of its excesses&mdash;and excesses there have been&mdash;than one would gather from the honourable member's speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in the case of the notorious Christmas party to which the honourable member referred, our own director serving on the bank returned his invitation to the Christmas party, wrote to the president of the bank, refused to attend and was most critical of the waste and squandering of money that he saw involved in it. I received a private letter from him to that effect which also related some other action which was taken in respect of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to quarrel with the purposes for which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was set up. I believe they are widely supported in this House and in this country. The democratisation of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union seems to me to be one of the most fundamental objectives we can pursue in the West and I thoroughly support it, as does the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the criticisms of the World Bank are concerned, it is also the case that we have taken very direct action to see those administrative procedures improve. The so-called Wappenhans report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Effective implementation: key to development impact</EMPHASIS>, which the bank commissioned in September 1992, pointed to a number of ways in which evaluation of projects could be improved to lead to a greater success rate in implementing bank projects. We will be following up those recommendations and we are pressing, through the executive board, for rapid implementation of the key recommendations of that report. In particular, we are encouraging a greater emphasis on measures to promote quality project preparation and implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have asked that that report and the bank's response to the recommendations be made public and that benchmarks be identified against which donors can monitor the report's implementation. So far as the pay and perks to which the honourable member referred are concerned, again, that is something towards which we have taken a stern attitude. We voted against the recommended increase in salaries, along with the United States of America and Canada&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, it was somewhat remiss of me when I was speaking this morning presenting a report of an overseas delegation when you were in the chair to have failed to offer you my congratulations on attaining your high office. I would like to correct that oversight, and do so now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to take part in the second reading debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1993. This Bill seeks to make changes to one of the most significant pieces of legislation which specifically affects the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The House is also, of course, considering the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first time that I have spoken in these areas in the House in my new capacity as shadow Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I come to the portfolio with some background and a keen interest in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, having served as the Deputy Chairman in the last parliament on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and as a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. As a result of these positions and interests I have had the opportunity to travel widely within Australia and recognise the enormity of some of the tasks and problems that lie ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a demonstration of the coalition's support for the reconciliation process, it is my intention, in addition to my new responsibilities as the shadow Minister, to continue as the coalition's representative on the reconciliation council. We are pleased to see also, in true cross-party spirit, that Senator Kernot has also chosen to remain on the council, in spite of her own added responsibilities as Leader of the Australian Democrats, and we are obviously pleased to welcome that move on her part. Therefore both the major non-government parties on the council have upgraded their representation on the reconciliation council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously this House will be occupied in the coming months with issues arising from matters such as the Mabo judgment and the implications of potential constitutional change that this might have for our indigenous people. On behalf of the coalition, I trust that we will be able to continue the broad cross-party approach which has been established so successfully by my predecessor as shadow Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms, this amendment Bill proposes changes to three areas of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. Firstly, it reduces the number of commissioners and the number of regional councils; secondly, it provides for the full-time appointment of all commissioners and the regional council chairpersons; and, thirdly, it removes the existing power of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) to appoint the chairperson of ATSIC and the two non-elected commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said quite frequently that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. So we in the coalition are indeed very flattered by the Government's obvious adoption of two important aspects of our own Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs policy that we took to the last election&mdash;an excellent policy and just one part of a broader, caring coalition social agenda which we were regularly accused of not even having. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well known that the Government was not expecting to win, and I can see the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, who is at the table, blushing in agreement. The Government entered the election really rather bereft of policies, including, I suspect, some in this area. So the adoption of our policy thrust as contained in the ATSIC Amendment Bill before the House today is a product of an active and an innovative Opposition&mdash;an Opposition which set the agenda as far back as June 1992 with the release of our green paper signalling proposed reductions in the number of regional councils from 60 to 30 and a reduction in the number of national commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments before us today are the first major changes, I believe, to be proposed since the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act was proclaimed in 1989. Though, as I have already pointed out here today, the main thrust of these amendments obviously stems from our coalition policy, I will give the Minister the benefit of the doubt from his second reading speech and focus on his assertion at that time that the amendments are the result of attention to the commission's review into the ATSIC Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This review into the operation of the Act was required by section 26 of the Act and had to be conducted prior to the end of the first term of its elected commissioners and to be reported to the Minister. There is no dispute that these recommendations are contained in the review of the operation of the Act and their heralding in coalition policy just under a year ago is not surprising given the wide-ranging consultations with all sectors of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities pursued by my predecessor, the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Chisholm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the coalition's white paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ATSIC the way forward</EMPHASIS>, was completed. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently there are 60 regional councils in Australia. This is an impossible number of councils to be adequately serviced by ATSIC. As the regional councils are to become the prime decision making body at program and project level it is essential that they have the best people on them and are adequately resourced and adequately serviced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction in the number of regional councils is absolutely central to ATSIC's future success and the implementation of these proposals. The smaller number of regional councils will allow those regional councils to be better serviced by existing ATSIC regional offices.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition's policy at the last election also proposed that the number of national commissioners be reduced from 20 to 14 and that, with an increased workload, commissioners be adequately resourced. The Bill before the House today will reduce the number of commissioners from 20 to 17&mdash;one commissioner for each 17 ATSIC zones around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change to full-time appointments for commissioners and regional council chairpersons is also something the coalition supports. It is widely acknowledged that the burden of part-time work taken on, no matter how enthusiastic the commitment, has proven a far greater than anticipated load than it was at the time that ATSIC was formed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the commission spends over a half a billion dollars per year, and increasingly will aim to devolve responsibility for management of the regions, both the commissioners and the regional chairpersons must cover large distances, they are responsible for significant sums of money, and they are legally accountable for how this money is spent. The areas of responsibility are quite diverse, ranging from economic matters, health, housing, buildings, attendance at public meetings both within the ATSIC structure and in the broader community. Effectively, this is an enormous burden and it is, in reality, full-time work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not to pay commissioners ultimately produces unsatisfactory outcomes. Either part-time commissioners are left to live on a pittance or they are employed by someone else but are not giving their full attention to that other paid employment, thereby jeopardising their job; or they are not giving the ATSIC post its due. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have any problem with the first two areas of this amendment Bill. We do, however, have some degree of concern about the Bill's removal of the Minister's prerogative to choose two commissioners and especially his prerogative to select the chairperson. While we certainly acknowledge the importance of democratic principles in assisting the achievement of greater self-management and independent decision making, the coalition parties are also concerned about aspects of control and accountability, particularly where government funds are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its review of the operation of the ATSIC Act, the commission itself acknowledged the difficulties inherent in a community elected chairperson. In expressing the belief that it is time to elect it own chairperson, the commission stressed that the chairperson must be, `a person in whom the Government may have total confidence, at the same time having the confidence, trust and the ability to represent all members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where are we if none of the commissioners fits that bill? Where are we if none of the commissioners, even though they might be a perfect representative for their zone, possess the very special range of skills and background experience as expressed in the ATSIC review report? What controls are there, for instance, for the removal of an elected chairperson who is just simply unable to meet these vital criteria?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These points can be emphasised no better than by turning our focus on the Minister's very admirable choice for ATSIC's first three-year term, Lois O'Donoghue. I believe that without doubt Lois O'Donoghue does possess all of these required prerequisites, and more. She is an outstanding administrator. She is firm and fair in dealing with people and chairing meetings. She gets things done and she is a public speaker and international representative par excellence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the coalition's concerns in relation to the removal of the powers of the Minister to choose two commissioners and select the chairperson, it is my intention to move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission should consist of 14 persons, of which:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)12 must be elected and two must be chosen by the Minister;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)the Chairperson must be chosen by the Minister from any of the 14 Commissioners". </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to moving that amendment, I also want to comment on the regional council elections which are held every three years. Of course, voting is not compulsory and is by secret ballot. The last regional council elections attracted a total of some 1,611 nominations for 790 vacancies. Voting took place at 850 stationary booths and 400 mobile polling places. Approximately 37,000 people voted out of a total of 114,000 eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. With the reduced number of councillors, I understand that now there will be only 500 to 600 vacancies at this next set of elections. Obviously, we all hope that there will be a far higher voter turnout at the next election which is due in November or December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One important provision in this Bill which I particularly want to note is clause 18 which allows for rule changes for regional council elections to come into effect with a shorter lead time than at present. I point out that the revised arrangements are in line with what already exists in other government legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this amendment is necessary to provide a mechanism which will at some time in the future enable the introduction perhaps of things like a ward system such as that which exists in Australia now at the local government level. The importance of a ward system for regional councils will protect against minority groups in the region being swamped by majority groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have travelled around Australia during the last three years, particularly in regional areas, I have visited a number of places where there has been more than one community. Invariably the less powerful community groups have expressed concerns that majority groups have taken control and ignored the needs of minorities. I understand there is to be wide consultation by ATSIC in the coming months with communities about a possible ward system. Personally, I believe it has a lot to commend it and I hope it will be in operation before this year's elections take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has emphasised the high degree of cross-party support for the direction currently being followed in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. As my predecessor said, such support in any circumstances is often fragile. It is something never to be taken for granted. On this occasion I agree with the Minister that support for ATSIC by both sides of the House is largely attributable to the quality, commitment, expertise and performance of the ATSIC commissioners and their staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the functions of ATSIC include the formulation and implementation of programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the monitoring of programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and the development of policy proposals to meet national, State, Territory and regional needs and priorities of their people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perhaps rather ironic&mdash;and maybe also a demonstration of a certain maturity&mdash;that we now and then witness criticisms of ATSIC from within its own constituency when ATSIC has not played to the tune of a particular interest group or individuals. Of course, there is often healthy criticism and it is a positive signal of democracy at work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister, in his speech, noted the urgent nature of this legislation in view of the requirement for regional council elections to be held before the end of this year. This means that, unless the proposed changes to the Act are made prior to the winter recess, the opportunity to implement the changes proposed by this Bill would be lost for another three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I will be taking special interest in the next round of regional elections. I shall be watching with great interest, particularly in view of the disappointing turnout and the quite immense criticism of this poor turnout at the last elections. I cannot state strongly enough how vital these elections are to our indigenous people. It is vital that they demonstrate their willingness and ability to be part of determining their own futures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The candidates standing for election are presenting themselves as candidates for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to represent the views and aspirations of their region. A vote in the ATSIC regional council elections will mean a vote in support of taking control; a vote in support of Aboriginal self-reliance&mdash;and what, I ask, could be more important?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister, in his second reading speech, also noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional proposals for changes to the Act will be put before the Parliament at a later stage.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition will be waiting for these changes and we commend further measures in our own policy to the Minister for his attention. We are particularly keen to see the continuation of the present high commitment to accountability by ATSIC provided through the Office of Evaluation and Audit. However, we would point out to the Minister that we do have some concern that the ATSIC Act does not contain a provision requiring the tabling of other audit reports of portfolio related agencies and ATSIC funded organisations. We believe that it would be appropriate for those to be required to be tabled in this Parliament so that Parliament can examine them directly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should not assume that, because the coalition is determined not to obstruct the path towards a proud and self-sufficient life for all of Australia's indigenous people, it will not be immune from our continued scrutiny of its policies. I remind honourable members of this House that, beyond all the promises and the rhetoric,  the bottom line is that what all of us must achieve is a vastly improved living standard for this most disadvantaged group of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As expressed in our policy, we on this side have clearly defined objectives to address this disadvantage. These goals must be achieved and they must be achieved by focusing on tangible benefits at the coalface as a result of the programs, and not as a result of the regular distribution of welfare. With a commitment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves towards self-reliance and with cross-party support in this Parliament we have already seen an increased number of success stories in business enterprise, academia and in sport, but there is of course still a very long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now move to the second Bill in this cognate debate, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1993. The purpose of this Bill is to add three parcels of land to that granted to Aboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory. These additions result from agreements between three parties, the Northern Territory Government, the Jawoyn Association and the Zapopan mining company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand this is an amicable settlement of the Catfish Dreaming and Eva Valley land claims and under the agreement Zapopan will be allowed to proceed with the gold mining venture at Mount Todd, a development which is important to the region and to our national economy. It has effectively resolved a longstanding claim for the Jawoyn people. The Jawoyn have agreed not to pursue any further claim to native title or to support any such claim by any other person in respect of the mineral leases involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also agreed to allow Zapopan unrestricted access to the land whilst undertaking to support ongoing exploration activity by the company. In turn, Zapopan has agreed to provide employment and training for Aboriginal people at the mining site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third parcel of land involved effectively secures for the Northern Territory the current and future water supply for Tennant Creek in return for its support for the scheduling of the land. This is to be achieved by the granting of a licence allowing the Northern Territory Power and Water Authority the right to continue its borefield operations in the Tennant Creek area and by the granting of a lease to secure access to present and future borefields on that and adjacent Aboriginal land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole package is an important agreement. It is important that these three parties have agreed on some critical issues and it is also important for its demonstration of the Northern Territory Government's capacity to deal with Aboriginal issues in a rational and productive manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is of the view that were the Northern Territory a State in its own right it could of course have proceeded in this freely negotiated deal, for effectively that is what it is, without Commonwealth involvement. However, whilst we on this side of the House support the Bill for the reasons I have stated, particularly in view of the productive outcomes it will achieve, we must express some dismay in relation to the aspects of the bargaining against implied native title entitlements which underpins the agreement. We are adamant that such bargaining tools should not be seen as setting a precedent for future agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill and commends it to the House. The coalition also supports the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1993, subject to the amendment that I have moved to enable the Minister to nominate the chairperson of ATSIC. The coalition awaits the outcome of these measures with interest and with the fervent hope that they may benefit the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments proposed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), which go to the election by the commissioners of their own chairperson, and the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition, in a sense, indicate some of the differences of approach that exist between the Government and the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister is to be commended for bringing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill into this House. In a sense, the legislation represents the confidence of the Government in Aboriginal people being able to choose their own leadership as an essential part of their right to basically deal with their own future, to make decisions which are essential to be made by them on behalf of their people and, if we are to be logical, to apply the principles that apply right throughout our own democratic institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I listened with great interest to the comments made by the shadow Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), on the commendable qualities shown by Lois O'Donohue; and I agree with them. But, if these same rigorous standards were applied to all the members who from time to time are elected to this Parliament, the honourable member might well have some doubts. If we consider the speculation going on within the Opposition and the public comment being made about the requirements of the existing leader or a new leader, it seems to be a bit rich for the shadow Minister in this situation to come in and say, `It is all right for us in political parties to have these kinds of problems. It is all right for us to have these kinds of problems in this Parliament. But it is not all right for those same problems to be confronted by Aboriginal people because we somehow doubt their capacity to wrestle with those problems with the same capacity that we wrestle with them in our own political institutions and to reach the best decision'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that the next chairperson does not have all the same qualities as Lois O'Donohue but may well bring to the job new qualities. I do not think members of the coalition feel deeply grieved that the present Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) does not necessarily have all the qualities of Sir Robert Gordon Menzies. Perhaps they wish he did. But at the end of the day the Minister has acted upon the representations that have come to him from the Aboriginal leadership itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not doubt the sincerity of the shadow Minister but I say, on the basis of some considerable experience in this matter, that at the end of the day, if we are serious about reconciliation, it is essentially a white problem. For some 200 years Aboriginal people throughout the length and breadth of this great nation have been trying to reconcile themselves to living within the framework of a dominant white culture&mdash;a culture which in many ways they found brutally oppressive and foreign to the traditions, attitudes and religious beliefs that had governed them before our predecessors came to this land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If that is the case, the shadow Minister should withdraw his amendment. For once, let the coalition say that it is prepared to take the same sorts of challenges as the Minister has accepted and accept the fact that although ATSIC is in many ways an imperfect instrument it is a major step forward. But it is no more an imperfect instrument than any of our own political parties. It is no more an imperfect political instrument than this Parliament itself. It seems to me to be an exercise of almost continuing patronage to say, `Yes, we think it is not a bad idea, but not now'. It is always for the coalition `not now'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to listen to the view taken by the shadow Minister on behalf of the coalition, but I was not surprised at his position on native title. I am one who thoroughly supports the High Court decision and rejects some of the notions that have been put forward by a range of vested interests in this community that there is something somehow indecent about the High Court recognising that which is a historic fact and giving legal recognition to native title and saying that it creates uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking as a lawyer&mdash;I think any lawyer in this House would agree&mdash;there are very few major cases in the history of the High Court which, while solving the immediate legal issue, in judgments created and elucidated by the justices, do not at the same time open up other questions which have to be the subject of ultimate legal resolution. Did the legal profession seriously complain when exactly that process brought forth a stream of litigation interpreting section 92? Half the lawyers I know who were involved in those matters educated their kids on the basis of those uncertainties. When Chief Justice Barwick took the court in the direction of opening up significant areas of the Tax Act, which ultimately led to very serious problems for the Treasurer and for governments in tax evasion, was there an outcry from the accountants, the corporate lawyers and the miners, saying, `Goodness me, there is going to be an area of uncertainty in this area of the law'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But on the first occasion when our indigenous people have won a significant judgment which recognises their previous occupation of our island continent and when the court takes a step forward to recognise in legal terms the reality of our history, goodness me, some uncertainty is also created. What is new about that?  Again, I was interested to hear the shadow Minister indicate how proud he was of certain aspects of coalition policy on Aboriginal affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about legal certainty, I would think one of the areas that the shadow Minister ought to look at and repudiate, particularly if he is concerned about legal uncertainty, is the decision of the coalition prior to the last election&mdash;and presumably it holds now because I see nothing repudiating it&mdash;which said it would hand over Uluru and Kakadu National Park to the Northern Territory Government. I invite the shadow Minister to consider the implications of that decision and to consider the legal implications when he is talking about the creation of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with an alternative government saying, `If we win the election we are going to hand over Uluru and hand over Kakadu National Park to the Northern Territory Government and its administration' is that it involves some very novel concepts indeed. The Commonwealth does not own Uluru or Kakadu; they are owned by their Aboriginal owners. In both cases the Commonwealth has a lease. I find it an extraordinary proposition, when the Commonwealth has leased property all over Australia, for us now to say `We not only reserve the right to repudiate the lease agreements that we have entered into'&mdash;and in the case of Uluru the period to run is some 90 years&mdash;`but also, as the lessee, we also reserve the right to tell the owner what is going to happen to it'. It is legal nonsense, and the honourable member knows it is legal nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than that, if the Commonwealth is going to take property that it does not own and it is going to tell the owners what is to be done with it, first the Commonwealth might have to compulsorily acquire it. Have those opposite thought of the hole that would blow in the Budget when we look at compensation and loss of property for some 90 years, and the damages and fiscal outlays that would involve? I say to the spokesman for the Opposition that it is time that he, because I do not doubt his sincerity in this matter, took his party back to the drawing board on the question of the significance of the Mabo decision, and was prepared to extend to the Aboriginal people and to ATSIC the same rights as are inherent in our political structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that they, in their own right, elect a leader who is less than adequate. But I would have thought that, even though some sections of the shadow Minister's own party believe that that has occurred, he should sympathise with the Aboriginals' right to do that. It is time that those opposite abandoned this concept of saying, `We will give to the Aboriginal people with one hand and take away with the other'. Previous decisions of this House affected the development of Kakadu, and the Aboriginal ownership did not come out of just the policies of the then government. Many aspects of it were implemented by a Liberal government under Fraser on the basis of an independent report. One of the options put&mdash;do not think it was not put to Prime Minister Fraser by the Northern Territory Government at the time&mdash;was that the Northern Territory Government should have Uluru and Kakadu, and he refused. He was right to refuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, if there was a change in that view prior to the last election, it was a change that turned its face upon the previous policy of the Liberal Party. Worse than that, it involved the creation of legal principles, if those opposite are talking about uncertainty, which make Mabo look one of the most certain legal decisions ever made in the history of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an appalling legal proposition. Would those opposite go to a group of owners of property in the Melbourne or Sydney central business districts and say, `Although you may have leased this to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth feels that it does not want to go on with these leases. We are not only not going to go on with it but also we are going to tell you what you as an owner should do with it? Where does the Opposition get the precedent for that ugly concept? But it was good enough for the Opposition to write it into its policy; it was good enough for its candidates throughout Australia to stand on that when they were dealing not with the property owners of Sydney and Melbourne but with the traditional owners of these areas of land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was the Minister who had the responsibility of negotiating with the traditional owners of Uluru. It was not easy. When I went to see them to say that the Commonwealth had decided to give it back to them, they thought that was very nice and they thought they were doing the Government a favour by letting us give them a bit of paper, because they said, `That is nice. If it makes you happy, that is good, because we know we have always owned it'. When it was handed over, I stood and watched Aboriginal people who had driven from all over Australia to visit the centre of their dreaming. I watched a young girl of 13 from Queensland stand in tears as she realised that this land, this symbolic edifice, central to their dreaming, was now theirs, and was pledged to be theirs by the Commonwealth Government. In a moment&mdash;I hope of political stupidity&mdash;the members of this coalition are prepared to say, `If we are elected, we will take it away from them'. It is a novel concept&mdash;a brutal concept. But it is a stupid concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I believe the time has come when, if the shadow Minister can undertake a reconciliation process, he will do the Opposition some credit&mdash;if he takes the Opposition back to the drawing board on those aspects of its policy which did not get much of a mention in the election campaign. He could also do himself some considerable credit in the eyes of this Parliament if, by the time this legislation gets to the Senate, he can organise a major rethink within the Opposition that says, `We as a parliament are prepared to trust the Aboriginal leaders of ATSIC to accept the same responsibilities, to possibly make the same mistakes and, indeed, to make the correct decisions when it comes to the election of their chairperson and the operation and management of their structures as we accord ourselves such trust in our parliamentary institutions and in our political party'. If that occurs, I will say, and be happy to say, that this coalition has taken a major step in the process of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish as I began: reconciliation is not an Aboriginal problem. It is a real problem for those of us who live in a dominant white culture and who have got to come to terms with the depth of Aboriginal culture, their history, their religion and their relationship to this land. When we do, this community will take on a strength, a durability and a relationship to our land which sees it as something more than a simple object of real estate speculation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I make a few brief comments in this debate&mdash;and they will be reasonably brief&mdash;I would like to join the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) in paying tribute to the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), the previous shadow Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, for his sensitive and caring comprehension of all the issues involved in that portfolio. His handling of the issues was a credit to himself and to this Parliament, particularly in view of the very necessary bipartisan approach taken to the reconciliation process. This House should continue to support that reconciliation process in a very strong, bipartisan way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the honourable member for Aston, the Opposition is in general agreement with these Bills. That agreement is subject to a specific amendment to one Bill, and to a caveat in principle on the other. There are two issues I would like to cover briefly. The first is the issue of responsibility and accountability; the second is land rights. Both issues have been covered very sensitively by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding); especially so for somebody of his portfolio exposure and experience as a member of the legal profession. That is not to say that I agree with all that he has said tonight. Nevertheless, we should all take his remarks on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I disagree with the honourable member's analogy about leadership, some of his criticisms and his rather party political approach to some of these issues. He talked about responsibility and accountability in a way that rather implied that the Opposition was critical of the Aboriginal people for their shortcomings in those areas. I would say to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), and to the House generally, that the basis of our amendment is this area of responsibility and accountability, both of which, of course, extend to the Minister. We have to look at both of those qualities&mdash;responsibility and accountability&mdash;as they relate to the Minister, the ATSIC zones, and the local Aboriginal bodies, such as the Aboriginal and Islander housing companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all due respect, that is where the honourable member for Melbourne Ports got his analogy all mixed up, and that is the logic behind the Opposition's amendment. We are saying that the Minister should continue to exercise his ministerial responsibility&mdash;his discretion&mdash;and that that can best be done by his appointing the chairman and at least two of the commissioners. There is no hidden agenda. There is no implied criticism of the Aboriginal people by reference to their inadequacies. That is where the honourable member for Melbourne Ports was quite incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of land rights, anybody who suggests that the Mabo case is clear-cut is fooling themself. It is a Pandora's box. That is why the honourable member for Aston, the shadow Minister, made the point about the Opposition's caveat on the second Bill. In some ways it is a bucket of worms&mdash;a bucket of legal worms&mdash;which still has to be worked through. I suspect that the legal argument surrounding that judgment will continue for some years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that the Minister is in the chamber because I would like to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> excerpts from an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> by the former senator, John Stone. While I do not agree with the article, it highlights certain perceptions in the community which need to be addressed. When the Minister eventually enters this debate, I would be interested to get his reaction to those perceptions. In the article, Mr Stone referred to an IPA booklet, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Black suffering, white guilt?</EMPHASIS> and statements made therein by his IPA colleague, Dr Ron Brunton, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . only when the special legal status of Aborigines is abolished will it be possible properly to address the problems of Aboriginal disadvantage. Governments should move towards dismantling the whole structure of `Aboriginal' policies, departments and institutions. Statutes and regulations should not distinguish Aborigines from other Australians. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure the Minister will make some comment about Mr Stone's own comments, when he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most Australian's wish to see their Aboriginal fellow-Australians happy, healthy, well-educated, well-remunerated and well-housed: while many of them are, the majority clearly are not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are, however, told that so-called `assimilationist' policies are `not acceptable'; and that Aboriginal culture must be respected, preserved and made available again to Aboriginal Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasingly, there arises the `unthinkable' question. Can Aboriginal culture really survive (other than in a museum sense) in this 20th Century high technological world?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that is what the Minister will say. Mr Stone continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And do policies which tend to push Aboriginal Australians back into it merely condemn them to further disorientation and alienation from the mainstream Australia in which, like it or not, they will have to live?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Stone then refers to comments made by the deputy editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, Mr Jack Waterford, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Waterford, who is personally very sympathetic to the Aboriginal `cause', strongly criticised his fellow journalist for so neatly toeing the politically correct line on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, he argued that the mindless charges of `racism' levelled against anyone who questions current official policies are highly detrimental to the interests of Aborigines themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the real problem, he says, is this: `Real change in Aboriginal affairs<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> depends on Aborigines themselves. Only they can liberate themselves . . . '</PARA>
<PARA>He concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Brunton says: `Aboriginal suffering is a valuable `resource', that can be colonised by a wide range of individuals for their own ends'.</PARA>
<PARA>Personally, I regard the article as extreme, but I would be interested in what the Minister has to say about it, and how he reacts. I hope that no-one in this place, least of all the honourable member for Melbourne Ports&mdash;who is a reasonable man&mdash;would disagree that Aboriginals are more disadvantaged than any other group in our community. However, there are perceptions in some quarters that they are receiving more than even-handed treatment. That is not my view but it is a perception. It is a perception that all of us have to get around, educate people about, and make sure that it does not get out of control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From local experience, I know&mdash;and the Minister knows from papers I have given him about local problems with accountability, responsibility and all the rest of it&mdash;that, when some of these people break the law, issues of racism are raised. In recent weeks I have been referred to as a Black basher and a racist&mdash;not by the Minister, I might add&mdash;by some of the local Aboriginal militants, if that is the right word. The Minister knows me well enough to say that is not so. I am not a racist and I am not a Black basher. But remarks like that are made as a defence mechanism when some Aboriginals are breaking the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I am making in this debate is that people have to understand that there is such a thing as the law of the land. I realise that there are laws within the Aboriginal community as well, but there are laws in this land which they, like everybody else, have to adhere to. Not everybody might agree with that, but in my view, that is the case&mdash;that they have to adhere to them until such time as those laws are changed. At the moment, when they do infringe the law, they are very quick to react by turning on people and referring to them, myself included, as racist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very appreciative of the communication I have had from the Minister in terms of these local problems with my groups in the Toowoomba area. I hope that they are being investigated. I am sure they are, as the Minister has indicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I would say to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that the reconciliation process is something that we all must comply with. I think it is in the national interest that we complete it. But personally I draw the line at treaties and open-ended land rights. I know from what the honourable member said earlier that he will not agree with me, but it seems to me that land rights should not be open-ended, as I think he is indicating. Nevertheless, I think it is in the interests of this nation&mdash;and the Aboriginal people are part of this nation&mdash;that the reconciliation process should continue and we should continue to support it strongly. </PARA>

I have a real interest in the area of Aboriginal affairs, as does the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody that more government action is needed, and that is certainly something that we need to have a look at. There are a number of Aboriginal people in an urban area in my electorate. I do not really think that we always get to their problems. Really, we have to be more caring towards the Aboriginal people and the problems that they face. I believe that the royal commission report highlighted to Australia the problems that are faced out there and why we as a nation need to work closer to resolve the problems. Only today my friend the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) asked a question in Question Time about another death in custody of an Aboriginal person. I think that is a very important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill makes further changes to ATSIC. In my view it gives ATSIC a lot more autonomy in the way it deals with helping the Aboriginal people and in the work it needs to do to make life a lot easier and a lot more equitable for Aboriginal people.

We must assist them to determine for themselves how they can best be assisted and how they can make their own decisions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I will talk to the second Bill, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. I think that it was in 1984 that we introduced legislation in Queensland which delivered ownership of the 7 1/2 million acres of land called the reserves to the local shire council that had been set up. It had both legal and beneficial ownership of those areas of land. The council had a mechanism by which it could pass that land down to private ownership, and it was our stated intention that it should pass it down to private ownership. I think the record speaks for itself. In six years we did not have a single riot in Queensland. In the last four months we have had six major riots in which police have had to be flown into the reserves. In those six years the trauma rate in the areas concerned dropped by half. Since the reversal of that legislation the trauma rate is again rising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What in fact happened was that Queensland came into line with the laws of the Federal Parliament, so that the legislation in Queensland is almost identical with that being considered here this evening. It has been a disastrous failure. Even the most cursory glance at what has occurred in Queensland would indicate the failure of those laws. I would add that the worst riots in parliamentary history in Queensland took place when the ALP Government passed the new legislation. The previous Government never had a single demonstrator when it passed its legislation. We had nothing to hide. We flew all the Aboriginal council representatives down to Brisbane and gave them the legislation to go over, which, of course, they had been over many times before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In sharp contrast, the laws that were subsequently passed in Queensland were rejected by 1,000-odd people who demonstrated in front of Parliament House. They tore down the fence and the flag post in front of Parliament House and, in a very ugly confrontation with the police, tried to tear down the door of Parliament House itself. Those were the worst riots in parliamentary history in Queensland&mdash;and let me tell honourable members: we have had many bad riots in parliamentary history in Queensland. But these were by far and away the worst. Blood was shed on the portals of Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the way in which that legislation was received, in sharp contrast to the acceptance of the legislation passed by the National Party Government in Queensland. I take great delight in quoting from the ACC meeting before last at which one of my critics&mdash;and I say this with no degree of false humility&mdash;said, `Would to heaven we had the laws that we once criticised back in the State of Queensland'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Environmental Management Charge-General) Bill 1993 and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Environmental Management Charge-Excise) Bill 1993. The legislation introduces a user-pays principle into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Together with the regulations that will be tabled subsequently, it enables the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to levy tourist operators on the basis of the number of tourists who use their facilities. For the first time, tourist operators are permitted to transfer the permits which are enabled in other sections of the GBRMPA legislation. That means that they will be able to sell permits to other operators. I will say more about that later. Transit operators will also be exempted by the Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will not oppose the legislation, but we are concerned about what may come from this legislation in future. It is feared that the Commonwealth will reduce its funds to GBRMPA if funds are raised in this way and that, in return, GBRMPA will have to use its funds to manage the park rather than for the research for which it was originally intended. There is the further fear, voiced by the conservation groups, that GBRMPA will be forced to encourage what might amount to non-sustainable tourism to obtain sufficient funds for the running and management of the park. There is also the fear of the tourist operators in the area that this is indeed the thin edge of the wedge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second reading speech the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) said that the regulations will specify that the charge will be only $1 per day per tourist. However, this can be changed by regulation, and the tourist operators have very real fears that this is going to escalate. In Tasmania, where the user-pays principle has been brought into its park, those charges have escalated to the extent that the new national park fees are biting into park user numbers and one operator has totally lost his or her custom. We are concerned about what might happen in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition also sees problems with the levy as it will be applied at present. The tourist operators will bear the full burden of this charge. The charge was one of seven recommendations in the report of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. The report recommended that recreational users of the park be charged as well, but that has not been done in the Bill. Recreational users often cause more damage to the park than the tourist operators who maintain and care for the park. Special mention should be made of the Quicksilver operation and the marine biologists it employs to make sure that its facility is well looked after. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the permits for the tourist operators have been made transferable, they last for only three to five years. It would be much more advantageous to the tourist operators if the permits were for a longer period, because it puts the burden back onto them to care for a resource where they can sell that permit for a longer time. They are looking after it in perpetuity because it guarantees the capital investment that they have in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is only an enabling Bill. It is the regulations that set the path of what happens in this Bill. These regulations are mooted to come into force on 1 July. However, they have to be tabled for 15 days in parliament, which will not be sitting until August. The charges will be in force long before the Parliament has a chance to disallow them. This is a concern because there has to be retrospectivity if the Parliament disallows them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that GBRMPA be properly funded to protect the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest reef. Seventy per cent of the coral reefs in the world have been degraded. The Great Barrier Reef is one of the last remaining reefs not quite in a pristine state but certainly in a better condition than the rest of the reefs around the world. The park has 2,900 individual reefs, and it takes up 3,444 square kilometres&mdash;larger than the size of Great Britain. After Greenland, it is the planet's biggest protected area. It is the breeding ground for the 40-tonne humpback whale, and it is home to 1,500 species of fish. It has 350 types of hard coral. One million tourists a year come to the reef, and that is increasing at 10 per cent per annum. The economic value of the Great Barrier Reef to Australia is $1.6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the heritage that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is charged with protecting. But the reef is not without its problems for the management of GBRMPA. One problem is tourism. Between 1977 and 1987 the number of tourist operators in the park increased tenfold, and during that time the number of passengers they were carrying increased 35-fold. This has had an inevitable effect on the reef. The big cod are frequently found with gashes in their heads from the motor boats that cross them and other fish are found with fishing lines entangled in their mouths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recreational users of the park are not always as careful as those who are taken out by the tourist operators. There is damage to the reef from anchors from small boats. Tourist development has led to the destruction of mangroves. That was referred to in a report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts as the tyranny of small decisions where developments along the coast remove the mangroves and each council says, `Well, it really doesn't matter if it happens here because they are somewhere else'. That is the concern about the proposed development at Trinity Inlet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bottom-trawling is an enormous problem, but at present GBRMPA has not the funds to fully research the effect that bottom-trawling is having on the reef. It has a huge by-catch and the scientists feel that this is damaging the reef. At present there are not the funds to research its effect on the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always the possibility of oil tanker disasters. I referred to this last night in debate on Bills put before the House by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe). The waterway between the reef and the mainland is a shipping lane and there is a great need for the larger boats to carry electronic mapping and the differential global positionary system, DGPS, which enables them to see where the reefs are and anything in the channel and, at the same time, to be navigated by the satellites to where the ship is. There is also a need to examine whether it is possible or even desirable to use a route outside the reef and the advantages and disadvantages of requiring oil tankers to have double hulls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reef is suffering from eutrification. The nitrogen phosphorous from the farms up the rivers is coming down in the rivers, out onto the reef, and is deforming, weakening and killing the coral. This is one of the more serious problems that GBRMPA has to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the possibility of heavy metal pollution coming down from Papua New Guinea from the OK Tedi and Porgera mines, and that again has not been sufficiently researched. If that were not enough of the man-made disasters we are subjecting the reef to there is, of course, the danger of cyclones, the natural disasters. I refer to cyclone IVU where 70 per cent of the living coral in a reef 80 kilometres south of Lizard Island was destroyed. These then are the problems facing GBRMPA in its management of the Great Barrier Reef marine park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority has to maintain the value of this incredible resource whilst allowing multi-use of the site. It needs to manage the reef in such a way as to avoid overuse and user group conflicts, and at the same time it has to plan for the long-term future of the reef. GBRMPA clearly needs large resources to manage the day-to-day activities on the reef, to educate the reef users and to fund research into the problems facing the reef, but its budget is not big enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present there are 92 field officers at the reef&mdash;that is one field officer for every 3,500 square kilometres. GBRMPA estimates that it needs a minimum of 120 field officers. This year the Commonwealth Government contributed $14 million to GBRMPA, which is less than one per cent of the return from tourism in the area. The levy which GBRMPA will be able to collect after the enactment of this Bill and the tabling of the regulations will only add $1.5 million to its funds and, of that, 10 per cent will go in administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority not only needs a larger budget to run on; it also needs money for capital infrastructure. The situation is so bad that the authority has no money to put up signs which say `No Fishing Here' or to inform people what is acceptable or unacceptable on the reef, which are minor things. It needs large capital injections because it needs bases for the boats that are presently berthed at Cairns, Townsville and Rockhampton, which are not regarded as sufficiently close to look after the problems that arise on the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the coalition has grave concerns that the present resources available to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority are insufficient and that the current level of funding to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is not adequate for the job it has been entrusted with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, in its search for funds to manage the reef, will be forced to allow use above what is sustainable and that the Government will exploit charges to tourist operators. Overall, this Government is not fulfilling its responsibility in caring for one of Australia's greatest assets, the Great Barrier Reef marine park. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech we have just heard from the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) is interesting in that it was reasonably well informed on the details of the legislation but she did make some outrageous claims later in the speech with respect to alleged escalation of fees, which have not yet occurred. I would suggest that those fees are not substantiated by any evidence whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was rather ironic to hear her complain about alleged lack of funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority when, under Fightback, there was a promise of a $10 billion cut in budgetary expenditure for 1993-1994. Members of the Opposition find themselves in an impossible situation when they come into this chamber, shackled as they are, burdened as they are, by the insufferable weight of Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with a number of issues in respect of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Environmental Management Charge-General) Bill 1993 and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Environmental Management Charge-Excise) Bill 1993 which are being debated on a cognate basis. The honourable member mentioned the condition of the reef. There have been allegations by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority that the reef is generally in good condition. They lead me to believe that there is evidence of some degradation around heavily used areas and major centres of population such as Cairns and the Whitsunday Islands. I thought those assertions which have been made by the authority were inconsistent with the remarks reported to have been made by the chief of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority water quality project, a Mr Jon Brodie, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 13 April 1993. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a perception that the water of the reef is more turbid than in the past, and that the reefs are covered by more algae. We have photographic evidence that reef flats that were covered with staghorn corals 40 to 50 years ago are now totally denuded.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Brodie went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is enough evidence for us to be worried about the future of the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA>
<PARA>In another report published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 29 March 1993 the chairman of the World Conservation Union, a Mr Bing Lucas, said it was easy for people living in the region to forget the reef's importance. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The world would be poorer without the Great Barrier Reef. The world appreciates its values and that is why the reef was included on the World Heritage List.</PARA>
<PARA>As a resident of North Queensland, I would share the concern of those two authorities that there are grounds to be concerned about the condition of the reef. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority must ensure that the reef is monitored more closely than hitherto with the impact of heavy usage of the reef by tourism operators and also by the other matter referred to by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, the intrusion of nutrients from farm use into the Great Barrier Reef itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pay tribute tonight in this debate to a former Minister for the environment in the Hawke Government, Mr Barry Cohen. He did a wonderful job for the environment, particularly in relation to the Great Barrier Reef. I have often heard him in the House of Representatives chamber lauding the work of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and, in particular, its chairman, Mr Graham Kelleher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cohen, on a number of occasions, and indeed in an article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 18 May 1992, reminded his readers that it was the Whitlam Labor Government in 1975 that introduced legislation to establish the Great Barrier Reef marine park, and it was passed by that Government. That enabled the Fraser Government to establish the marine park in 1976. It should not be forgotten that it was the National Party's State Government in Queensland which vigorously resisted the establishment of the Great Barrier Reef marine park on the ground that it was an alleged infringement of State rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That legislation that was passed by the Whitlam Labor Government, although the park was established by the Fraser Liberal Government, was sufficient to give impetus to the campaign in 1981 to have the Great Barrier Reef inscribed for World Heritage listing. In that regard the Fraser Government deserves great credit for its support of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having regard to the history of protecting the Great Barrier Reef, the article I referred to in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 18 May 1992 also canvassed how any sane, reasonable person could object to the establishment of a small fee, $1 per tourist, when the tourist would perhaps pay $75 or $100 to travel to the reef. It mentioned that that money would be used by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority by way of compensation to carry out the necessary monitoring work that is so essential in this area. Indeed, the Liberal and National parties in their Fightback package acknowledged the principle of user pays. The Fightback document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe users of our national parks should contribute more towards their upkeep and the provision of facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>I have no quarrel whatever with that assertion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the growth of tourism on the reef, I am informed that in 1992 an estimated five million people visited the Queensland coast adjacent to the reef and spent about $1.4 billion. The best advice from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority itself is that by the year 2000 there will be between seven million and 11 million visitors to that region of Australia. Indeed, with that intrusion of tourists into the marine park area, one can appreciate the concerns of the authority that the cost of management is rising dramatically, that governments are finding it difficult to meet the costs of management, and also that there are costs involved in the research and education necessary to ensure the continued conservation of the reef itself. Furthermore, 75 per cent of that net revenue that will be raised by this new charge will be going towards the recently created cooperative research centre which will deal with the preservation and management of the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find the reaction to the charge by certain individuals somewhat difficult to accept seriously. I know in my own area there was one particular operator who was belly-aching about the charge of $1 per passenger to travel to the reef, but the same person had no difficulty accepting a 15 per cent goods and services tax on the fee for a person paying up to $100 to travel to the reef and had no difficulty accepting a $10 billion cut in budgetary expenditure and the effect that would have on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Indeed, the loudest squeals have come from those who will benefit most from these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures are not coming as any surprise to the population. In a communique issued by the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council meeting on 10 May 1988, it was proposed that the user pays principle would apply to tourist operators and tourists visiting the Great Barrier Reef. I quote from that communique:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the principle of charging for the commercial use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Queensland marine parks was endorsed by Council.</PARA>
<PARA>Who constituted the council? In attendance were Senator Graham Richardson, Senator Margaret Reynolds and&mdash;listen to this&mdash;the Hon. Geoff Muntz, MLA, then Queensland National Party Minister for Conservation, Environment and Tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also make the point in the debate that, for example, direct transfers between parts of the mainland and Queensland islands such as Magnetic Island, and so forth, are exempt from these charges, as the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) said in her second reading speech. Private recreational activities like boating and general access to beach and reef areas will not be subject to the environmental management charges referred to. In other words, the Government has gone to great lengths to try to assuage the concerns of people who thought that they might be adversely affected by the charges to be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make the point, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh has said, that these charges will be introduced to take effect from 1 July this year. The commercial operators will be required to have permits from the authority for the payment of these fees, except, as I said earlier, for the operators carrying direct transfer passengers. Commercial fishermen will not be charged as they already pay fees to fisheries management authorities, and private boat owners and persons using the facilities will not be charged these particular fees. The legislation provides for a fee corresponding to about $1 per passenger per day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the support of the Opposition on these particular measures. The honourable member for Hindmarsh outlined why the charges were being introduced&mdash;that is, because of the use of the Great Barrier Reef, particularly with tourism increasing dramatically at about eight per cent per year. I notice that in the Cairns area tourism growth is estimated to be at about 18 per cent per year. It is generally accepted in modern society, except sometimes in the National Party, that commercial users should contribute to the increased costs of management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue I should raise is that the process of consultation with persons affected has been going on, as I said earlier, for a long time. Indeed, for the last four years extensive consultations have been held with relevant industry groups up and down the length of the Queensland coast. This user pays notion of charging commercial users of our national parks is not unique. Indeed, the Queensland Government requires commercial tourist operators in national parks to have a commercial activities permit that costs $100 a year and a per head charge from $1.15 to $4.30. In the Hervey Bay Marine Park whale-watching operators pay the Queensland Government a fee of $500 to $1,500 per year and a per head charge of $2 per adult and $1 per child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, I believe that in a short period of time this legislation will be welcomed by its current opponents. Eventually they will have to face the fact that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority needs the money to provide this additional management that was referred to earlier by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, and also that it is only right and proper that commercial users should make some contribution to the management of one of Australia's greatest national assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that the efforts of our Minister in ensuring that this legislation has been introduced to the Parliament should be commended by all honourable members. She has been an indefatigable fighter for the preservation of our environment and has done everything possible to ensure that not only are there adequate laws for the protection of our environment, and particularly for the Great Barrier Reef, but also that there are adequate funds for the statutory authorities charged with the responsibility of monitoring, researching and educating Australians about the worth of these great national assets. I support the Bills before the House. </PARA>

However, I want to reassure the previous speaker, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), that the Opposition does not have an impossible task at all when it comes to talking about issues of this description. I found the giggling that went on at the table quite disturbing when we were discussing a subject as serious as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken on this subject every time there has been an amendment to the 1975 legislation. I was pleased to note that the previous speaker did acknowledge that it was the Fraser Government which introduced the legislation into this House. Before I commence my remarks, I would like to say that it comes as no surprise to any member of my party&mdash;state or federal&mdash;that the principle of user pays is a necessary requirement for all national parks. There are honourable members in the House at the moment who have opposed, on a state basis, our introduction of user pays for national parks. I wonder whether we should perhaps read some of those honourable members' comments about this user pays principle. However, I will not do that tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it should also be noted and recorded quite clearly that all the amendments that have been made to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act which we brought in in 1975 have been supported by the Opposition, certainly in the last 10 years. I think a lot of the breast beating which has been going on in this regard is totally and completely out of place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill because I have a long and continuing interest in this particular area of Queensland, having lived there for an important part of my life. I remind members of the parliament that some of us have been vitally and practically concerned about the welfare of the Great Barrier Reef for a lot longer than others. I guess my concern&mdash;I have a few years under the belt&mdash;for the welfare of the reef goes back longer than anyone's in either party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the previous speaker would understand, having come to North Queensland and then entered parliament, that one cannot live in North Queensland&mdash;as I am sure the next speaker, the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) will also tell us in her first speech on the subject&mdash;without becoming vitally concerned about the reef, irrespective of party politics. I suppose when one talks about the north of Queensland one has to include Central Queensland, which of course takes in the seat of Capricornia. What people from the south who have not been to the Great Barrier Reef can never understand is the local population's appreciation of the reef's significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I rise tonight in support of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). But I am amazed that, yet again, the Minister is not present for a debate on an amendment to this Great Barrier Reef legislation. She has not been present when any of the amendments have come through this House. I find that extremely disappointing, and honourable members may find it disappointing as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I proceed to the nuts and bolts of the legislation, I want to place on record yet again my total rejection of the Government's use of the guillotine, to which this Bill has been subject. We almost saw this situation aggravated earlier, Mr Deputy Speaker, as we have already discussed. I spoke on the matter of the guillotine at length last week. However, in prefacing my comments this evening the Government deserves to be soundly condemned for the way in which it has mismanaged the legislative program which has seen the guillotine brought to bear in only the second week of the 37th Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that governments&mdash;it happens to all of them&mdash;have to bring in guillotines at the end of sessions. Legislative problems always develop. But to have us geared for the guillotine in the second week of a new parliament? The Government has us rising on 27 May when we could have stayed here for at least another three weeks. Of course, as I said last week, the Government's executive could have a hidden agenda&mdash;perhaps involving some of its overseas trips. I do not oppose those. I see the new Minister for Resources (Mr Lee) smiling; goodness knows what he is smiling about. We could finish that very quickly. But I have great difficulty with this situation. My party has never stopped a parliament at the end of May. It has never brought in guillotines in the second week of a new parliament. This is absolutely awful and it bodes ill for what we will have to handle in the next three weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in answer to the previous speaker's throwaway comment that he thought we had an impossible task, let me reassure him that we come here with no fears of that at all. I do not want him to go home to Townsville upset about this. I do not want him worrying about our having an impossible task. He can relax; we are not worried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Great Barrier Reef is truly one of the treasures of the world, the protection of which Australians can feel justifiably proud. It has been&mdash;and I hope it remains&mdash;above party politics. I suppose it is significant that we have more people in the advisers' box for the debate on this Bill than we have had for any Bills in the last few days of sitting. That is a good sign. I am glad that they, at least, are here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we have always supported legislation of this nature. The coalition has a proud record in regard to the environment, but particularly in regard to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I stand here, with some experience, to let the House know that I have been part of this process over a period of time. This is not something one reads about. The next speaker has not read about it, she has lived it. The previous speaker, living on the reef, would have faced daily concerns such as when that awful hotel was built. Everybody was staggered by that. I just hope it is succeeding in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, we brought in this legislation in 1975, but the concern should not be about who brought it in or who did not, or who introduced it or who did not. That will get us nowhere. Two weeks into the 37th Parliament, I say to the Government: it does not have to worry about that. It has three years to attack us; but, by the same token, we have three years to attack it. It should watch out and be careful. I will digress from the Bill for a moment, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;I know I have your permission&mdash;but if you had told me that we were going to win the first week of parliament, I would have laughed at you. But I think it is generally agreed that, to date, the Government is not exactly in front as far as the public is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me get back to the Bill. I refuse to be tempted to digress, even by the Minister's mention of a television show. I must express my delight that, for the first time, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has come into the House to debate legislation about the Great Barrier Reef. I thank her very much; we are very appreciative. She might have come in to hear the next honourable member's speech as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister said in her second reading speech, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park supports tourism and fishing industries worth in excess of $1.3 billion annually. As we all know, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority spent approximately $17 million in the last financial year, about $14 million of which, thank goodness, was Commonwealth money. It is clear from these comparisons that use of the park via tourism and fishing is exceeding the park authority's ability to fund maintenance of the park, and that forms the basis of the legislation we are debating tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, I am pleased to speak in support of this Bill. I believe that it is only fair that, when we are faced with preserving one of the most treasured natural assets in the world, those people having access to the park and enjoying the recreational and commercial benefits that the park provides should be encouraged in some manner to contribute towards the maintenance of this wonderful area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that, despite the efforts of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the continued increase in tourism&mdash;and I was equally impressed by the figures that the previous speaker mentioned as the likely outcome in the Cairns area, et cetera&mdash;to the park has led to an increase in the workload for the authority and the strain on the resources with which it is equipped to protect the park. The authority is principally financed through State and Commonwealth appropriations, although the authority does collect some revenue through permit assessment fees which allow operators within the park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister made it clear in her second reading speech that the Keating Government is having difficulty in maintaining recurrent and adequate funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. I do not find that surprising given the unprecedented state of welfare dependency in this country from the Keating engineered recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to get into a long debate on that subject; in fact, I will not even debate it all. But I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that since the election it is readily apparent that this Government has no money, and Bills of this nature to do with cost recovery will be seen more frequently in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, to give the Government and the Minister credit, I am aware that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics did recommend some form of charge for users of the park, and I am led to believe the authority has had extensive consultations with representatives from the Queensland tourism industry. From my knowledge to date the tourism representatives have not objected to the charge in general; nor indeed to the user-pays principle which this Bill is all about. I am hopeful that such cooperation between the commercial and recreational users of the park and the authority will continue. In fact, it must continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is the Federal Government's principal adviser on the care and development of this marine park. And through this debate I should like to remind honourable members of the authority's goal. In its last annual report the goal of the authority was specified as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide for the protection, wide use, understanding and enjoyment of the Great Barrier Reef in perpetuity, through the care and development of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the central issue in regard to this legislation which we are debating tonight. We must be vigilant in protecting this wonderful area while still allowing scope for the general public to have access both in a commercial and recreational sense to the reef. Such care must relate particularly&mdash;and I bear in mind the next speaker will no doubt be speaking more on this&mdash;to the Shoalwater Bay region which I was privileged to visit last year as a member of the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. It was interesting to note how well the Army is looking after the area under its control, and I was very pleased to see how concerned the fishing industry in the Rockhampton area was that its fishing waters were duly protected and cared for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that in any future association with the reef the concern of the very active Shoalwater people is very much taken into account. It is the essence of the buzz phrase at the moment of `ecologically sustainable development' which is bandied about frequently these days. It is a trite unfortunate that sustainable development has become a term which is used far too often in the environment area and tends to lose its meaning because of its overuse. However, through debates such as this discussion tonight, I want to reinforce that message to the House, that it is areas such as the Great Barrier Reef which are the real tests of what sustainable development should be all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no second chance when it comes to the Great Barrier Reef. It is an area so unique that measures to  protect the reef must be encouraged almost at all costs. That is what the marine authority is there to do, and this Bill will enable the authority to improve its effectiveness in its objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the starting date of this legislation is to be 1 July this year. However, my understanding is that those organisations which presently hold a permit from the authority as well as those organisations granted a permit after 1 July will both be affected by the charge. I also note that the Minister has excluded private recreational activities from the charge. And I understand from the second reading speech that such activities to be exempted from the charge will allow private boating and general access to both the beaches and areas within the barrier reef. The previous speaker expanded on this and I agree with all he said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have any opposition to any of these items and the remainder of the Bill is not contentious. I would just add one note of caution to the Minister in regard to funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in light of the legislation we are debating tonight. The Minister made the point in her second reading speech that the Government had been successful in increasing the level of funding for the authority by 2.9 per cent per year in real terms. As we prepare for the winter recess after an unduly short autumn session, I say to the Minister that, as preparations are made for the Budget, it is my fervent hope that an increase in funding will be made to the authority as it carries out its important work over and above what we are debating today, and that this Bill is not seen as an avenue for the Government to cop out on its funding for protection of the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will certainly assist the authority in its endeavours to protect the reef. However, the Government must play its part in providing the necessary funds for that work to continue. I support the objectives of this Bill, though I will continue to keep a keen interest in the regulations for the charges which must be tabled in accordance with the legislation. I take this opportunity to once again congratulate Graeme Kelleher, the Chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and his staff for their superb work in protecting this wonderful area. I hope that the expected revenue that this Bill will provide&mdash;somewhere in the vicinity of $1 million annually&mdash;will allow for greater protection and enjoyment of the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I finish by saying to you, Mr Queenslander, and I am an old Queenslander&mdash;what is it Queenslanders now say?&mdash;beautiful one day, perfect the next!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill and cognate Bills presented to the House by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Ms Kelly). Her presence in the House is only one indication of her total commitment to protection of the environment across the continent but more particularly in the Queensland area, for which I commend her. Following my colleagues from Queensland, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and, indeed, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie), it is fair to say we can all speak from the heart on these Bills because we have been fortunate to live in the region and represent electors who live and work in the area. I know that the Minister also responds from the heart, as she has visited this area and been profoundly affected by those visits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the day following the election on 13 March 1993, when we were supremely successfully, I took my family to the beautiful Capricorn coast, more particularly to Emu Park, and purchased a home with a view of the Keppel Islands, part of the Great Barrier Reef. My new responsibilities as the member for Capricornia have, unfortunately, not allowed me to enjoy the wonderful view from my lounge room window of this beautiful area. I am not sure just when I will be able to spend some time enjoying the view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very privileged to live in this area and I know that the electors of Capricornia, particularly those who live and work in the mining towns and the primary producers in the hinterland, also have a particular affection for the Great Barrier Reef area, the Capricorn Coast, where they come to for recreation from their normal responsibilities out west. With the privilege of enjoying and living in this beautiful area comes a responsibility to protect this resource which justifiably earned its World Heritage listing in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians take their natural environment for granted. It is only when we travel that we become aware how much population pressures, industrial development and lack of knowledge have contributed to environmental destruction elsewhere on the planet. Unfortunately, it is often only when destruction is imminent that we Australians mobilise our concerns. In relation to the Great Barrier Reef, this occurred when proposals to drill the reef for oil and mine limestone were made by the Bjelke-Petersen Government in the 1960s. Then indeed we saw Australians, particularly people from Central Queensland, become very vocal in order to protect this asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This culminated in 1973 when the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Seas and Submerged Lands Act establishing Commonwealth jurisdiction over and title to the seabed below the low water mark outside State internal waters. Despite challenges by the States, the High Court upheld the Commonwealth's position in 1975. Of course, it was in this year, as has been mentioned by previous speakers, that the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Act to which these Bills relate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today people would be surprised if someone argued that such a priceless asset as the Great Barrier Reef ought to belong to and be controlled by a State government. However, this was the preposterous proposition peddled by the Bjelke-Petersen Government at the time. As with many other key environmental issues in this country it was a Federal Labor Government which saved the day and initiated the preservation of this unique asset which is now contributing approximately $1.6 billion to our national economy; $1 billion of which derives directly from tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previous speakers have done, I pay credit to Malcolm Fraser who, during his prime ministership, signed an agreement which set out the basis for joint management of the marine park with the Bjelke-Petersen Government. Since that time, 98.5 per cent of the Great Barrier Reef region has come under the Marine Park Authority's jurisdiction. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) mentioned in her speech, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park covers an area in excess of 300,000 square kilometres&mdash;an area larger than the United Kingdom&mdash;and extends 2,300 kilometres along the east coast of Australia from Papua New Guinea to south of the Tropic of Capricorn. The region includes 2,900 individual reefs, ranging in size from less than one hectare to more than 100 square kilometres, and 250 continental islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The region is both complex and vulnerable as an ecosystem and management of such a vast area requires cooperation between State, Federal and local governments and all of those whose activities impact directly or indirectly on the reef. Human activity on the reef includes: commercial fishing and tourism and private recreational activities, such as fishing, diving and camping, apart from shipping, scientific research and indigenous, cultural and economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, tourism is the big industry contributing in excess of $1 billion to the Australian economy. A significant proportion of this comes from overseas visitors, thereby contributing favourably to our balance of payments. Overseas visitors stayed approximately 5.9 million nights in reef resorts in 1991. Those Australians who sensibly holiday at home in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park also help to promote our domestic economy and employment in the tourist industry. For those of us who have been fortunate enough to sit on the beach of one of our beautiful islands and look back to the coastline of the mainland, it is indeed a profound experience and I recommend it to all those honourable members who have not had the opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991-92, approximately 2.81 million people visited the Great Barrier Reef and, as has been mentioned, forecasts estimate that this will grow to 3 million in the current financial year, representing a growth of between eight and 10 per cent a year. What is the impact on the reef of all these people? Are we in danger of loving the Great Barrier Reef to death? Some of the negative ecological effects of tourism include direct trampling by visitors. While it would seem wonderful to be able to put on a pair of sandshoes and walk around the reef, the impact is quite severe. Anchor damage by private and tourist operators from boating operations, the impact of construction of jetties and mooring structures and marinas on the reef, sewerage discharge from tourist resorts and vessels and the impact of recreational fishing and the collection of marine organisms on the balance of flora and fauna population composition are all negative impacts from tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the urgent needs is to research and manage the impact of human activity, not only to protect the ecological integrity of the area but also to preserve those attributes that are the basis for the tourism industry. The purpose of the Bills is to provide those people who benefit from the continued protection and management of the resource to make a contribution to the cost of the said protection and management; the user-pays principle. It is reassuring, as the honourable member for Herbert said, to learn that the Opposition parties supported this principle in Fightback which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tourists should contribute to the cost of maintaining and protecting environmental values. We believe users of our national parks should contribute more towards the upkeep and provision of facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>The only problem was that the coalition planned to cut spending on the environment by $10 million and, I dare say, to try to make up the difference with the user-pays principle and, of course, the GST. The figures were not going to add up. However, from the Government's point of view, the Bills presently before the House will raise $1 million in 1993-94, a significant addition to the $15 million the Federal Government now contributes to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority with a further $4 million coming from the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been previously mentioned, 75 per cent of the revenue raised from these Bills will go to the recently created Cooperative Research Centre for Sustainable Development of the Great Barrier Reef located at Townsville.  The tourist industry will be represented&mdash;the Association of Marine Park Operators&mdash;as will the Marine Park Authority, the James Cook University, the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the Queensland Department of Primary Industries. The core parties will be contributing $30 million in cash or kind over a 7-year period including an estimated $6 million from the tourist industry. This is another excellent example of industry, governments, and research institutes cooperating together. However, the cost to users, approximately $1 per passenger day, representing approximately one per cent of the cost&mdash;a typical day trip to the reef costing $100&mdash;is a small price to pay for the protection of this priceless World Heritage asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been noted, there has been extensive consultation with all participants in the industry over a four-year period. In speaking with some local representatives in Capricornia, it was pointed out to me that while there may have been some concerns raised, because no-one likes to pay a new imposition, in general terms all tourist operators are aware of their responsibilities and are prepared to support these new charges. Indeed, many of the concerns raised by tourist operators have been addressed in the schedule of charges during this period. They are designed to impact fairly on operators irrespective of their size. The fees also protect visitors from multiple charges and are in fact modest when compared with entry charges to other national parks in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that users across the board are aware of their responsibilities. In fact, I think it is true to say that when we do have to pay we value what we pay for. To digress, I am reminded that when I visited the Kosciusko National Park the imposition of the user charge brought it more directly to my awareness that this charge was necessary to protect that particular national park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Australians increasingly understand and accept the importance of protecting our environment and that this responsibility must be shouldered by the entire community. It is to the great credit of the Minister and this Government that emphasis is being placed on education of environmental issues. Having spoken to the Minister about these matters I look forward to her announcement on a number of educational initiatives which will educate the entire community on the need for environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that users of the reef will be made aware of their impact on the area and learn to cherish it, while being profoundly moved by its beauty and diversity. This awareness must also extend to communities and industries along the coast and hinterland adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Considerable research is required into the impact of rural and mining areas, as well as pollution due to urban development in coastal areas, including the clearing of coastal rainforests on waterways that ultimately empty into the reef. This is one of the responsibilities presently being undertaken by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. These Bills continue the Labor Government's responsible record on environmental protection, and I am pleased to support their passage through the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to participate in this Bill because the best part of the Great Barrier Reef goes completely along the coastline of Dawson. At the time when Dawson included Yeppoon and Emu Park all the major off-shore developments actually took place in Dawson. I cannot stress enough the beauty of this area and the need for its protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time the National Party, with which I am closely represented in Queensland, has been basically called to account for rape and pillage of the environment. Yet it is in the history books and on record that it was the Queensland coalition and the Federal coalition that really sealed this beautiful area into a park. While there are disciplines associated with a park environment&mdash;as there have to be&mdash;over the period of the last 20 years, developers, and, I believe, all Australians, have made a conscious and deliberate effort to consider the environment in any development that takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of that is somebody who is not well thought of in the tourist industry at the moment&mdash;Mr Skase. I believe that the Sheraton Mirage Hotel at Port Douglas is the most environmentally compatible development ever associated with the tourist industry. The basic ingredients and natural attributes of the surrounding place have been maintained. Anybody who looks at that development can only say that the developer has left the site in a better state than it was initially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In much the same way, within the Dawson electorate and very close to Proserpine&mdash;adjacent to the Whitsunday Passage&mdash;is the latest development of the Laguna Keys by Aqua del Rey. While there was a lot of concern initially as to what was going to happen, somebody described the land on which this $1 billion complex eventually is to rest as `so hungry that even a brumby would die on it'. That was what it was. In that development, even in the first stages, they have created a marina, a golf course and other facilities. Again, one has to say that the basic philosophy, both of government and developers, has been to be compatible with the environment. The Aqua del Rey facility has enhanced the land and we are the beneficiaries of it. That is onshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Offshore, while some of the early developments might have created some of the problems that were mentioned by the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), that development again is going on in sympathy with the surroundings. Probably the densest offshore development on that coastline is in that Whitsunday Passage area. On Brampton Island, Hamilton Island, Hayman Island, Lindeman Island and all the other associated islands, it is great. It is to our credit that Club Med decided to build the first of its facilities in the Southern Hemisphere on Lindeman Island, and did a wonderful job of it. As well, I want to stress that, while disciplines are necessary in some ways, the cooperation of the charter people and the developers has been great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Capricornia also spelt out a list of the problems that could eventuate from human passage and human degradation on the reef and within the islands. Nature also has a way of doing things which we cannot prevent and a lot of the damage that has been ascribed to the tourist industry or to people abusing the situation is small in comparison to the damage that can be done by a flood from the mainland and natural occurrences such as cyclones and things like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note from the GBRMPA report that it associates itself not only with the main reef but also the problems associated with it from the mainland. In particular, the aquarium at Townsville is a great credit to it. It is possible to get a sense of the reef just by going through that aquarium. Again I notice from the 1991-92 report that the outlays on the aquarium are not covered by the income. I suppose it is something that somebody has to look at from the point of view of recovery, while realising that this is a facility that is being offered onshore for the education of Australians who cannot get offshore, or even the visitors who come there. That is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of the legislation is the user-pays principle. I know that the former Queensland Government was looking at this in conjunction with the Commonwealth. I think it is fair to say that the tourist operators are not enthusiastic about the discriminatory manner in which this charge is being made, as well as the possibility of it being increased tenfold just by the stroke of a pen. That is the real fear. It might be easy enough to say that a dollar per passenger per day is not a great amount, but other government charges and costs and taxes that charter operators have to bear are added to that&mdash;and I mention the greatest one of all, the fuel excise. They do not have bitumen roads. The roads out there are pretty rough at times, yet their contribution does not assist them in any way in their activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fuel is a large cost. If we take into account sales tax, payroll tax and all the others, this extra charge is just a bit at the end. To describe it as a dollar overlooks the fact that some of these operators&mdash;and they have been to see me&mdash;are in a situation where they could be paying $10,000 extra, and having $10,000 coming out of their operations is very difficult for them. These areas are not associated with the main international routes. They have to fight for their tourist dollars as much as anyone else. The discriminatory aspect of it is the fact that casual travellers&mdash;there are thousands who use that reef in their own motor boats&mdash;are less disciplined in their approach to the reef than the charter vessels are, or have become over recent years. The Bill is discriminatory in that while I understand it gives the ability to tax these casual visitors, it is not going to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously the Government has come to the natural conclusion that while it can assess and tax charter operators and let them bear the cost of collection and recovery, it cannot do it to private operators. Indeed, the policing of it would be an impossibility, and it is discriminatory. I have to say to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly)&mdash;I think she already knows it&mdash;that although agreement might have been reached with all the tourist authorities in Queensland, there is by no means harmony within the charter operator camps. I believe, as others have said, that they are prepared to cop it, but they do have the fear that at the stroke of a pen the amount can be increased and they will be left to bear that charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are also concerned about how the amount of $1 million will contribute towards meaningful research and protection of the reef. That is very important, but I think the Minister would be aware of those concerns and I hope she is able to allay the fears that these people have. If the money is just going to go into a bottomless pit or perhaps pay for the recovery of the aquarium at Townsville, there would be a lot of unhappy operators in the Whitsunday Passage. It is very important, as the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) has just said, that with this gradual tendency towards cash recovery, or user pays, that we do not allow the Commonwealth or the State of Queensland to pull out funds as has been done in other operations, and leave that flow-over to be collected from the people themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other fears I have as far as the reef is concerned is that it is becoming a bigger trade route not only to Europe but also to Asia and the Pacific, and vessels carrying coal are now in the vicinity of 200,000 to 300,000 tonnes&mdash;they are huge vessels. When we are looking at vessels of that size carrying coal, and we have oil tankers of the same tonnage using that route, any mishap in that area will be catastrophic. While there may be different opinions of what oil would do to the reef, through drilling in it or otherwise, there is no doubt that oil would cause a massive problem to the fauna and flora of the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report. I think it is imperative that Commonwealth authorities maintain their vigilance, allow only properly surveyed and authorised vessels within that area, and ensure they are piloted, whenever possible, at all times. I have had a complaint in my office from a person who was a captain on one of the oil rigs in Western Australia. That complaint proves conclusively to me that the Commonwealth has been derelict in its responsibility in allowing ships which did not have all the safeguards that were necessary to be anchored at the platforms in that northern area of Western Australia, and particularly with the drilling of oil that could have been catastrophic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the last fortnight I have had complaints about the recently convened committee of Mr Tom Burns, the Queensland Minister, in connection with recreational fishing. It appears to the commercial fishermen that the recreational review is pinpointing controls on commercial fishing with no suggestion of such controls on recreational fishing. There has to be some curb on recreational fishing. The professionals use reefs that are authorised for fishing, whereas the recreational fishermen, the part-timers and weekenders, cause a lot of mischief on reefs that should be out of bounds to them. There has to be a period allowed for a reef to be safeguarded so that fishing species can re-breed, and there has to be some control over recreational fishing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, the concern of the commercial fishermen is that all the inquiries they have been able to make, in spite of the fact they have had a two-year management plan in place, show that the whole basis of the recreational fishing inquiry is going to mean another penalty to beach fishermen and net fishermen, and also the re-licensing of boats. They have already gone through a rather grim two-year period on re-regulation and re-licensing and having licences taken off them, and also having reefs closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears in this Bill that there is a penalty for people who try to operate a small business in the area, but for anybody who wants to operate freelance there is no control whatsoever. Yet I would suggest it is the charter vessels, the professional fishermen, who have a greater concern for our environment and the reef than do the casual weekend users. I suggest to the Minister that there is concern about the imposition of this levy, mainly because it could increase. I entered this debate to set the history straight on who is responsible for the barrier reef&mdash;I well recall David Thomson, who at the time had some control over the reef, giving a guarantee to this Parliament day after day after day&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will briefly join in this debate on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill. May I endorse some of the statements made by my good friend the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). I think the summary he has given the House tonight on the attitudes towards this particular Bill are very relevant indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that some four years down the track, after a great deal of debate and a great deal of discussion, we now have a situation where the levy is finally going to be implemented on 1 July this year. As the honourable member for Dawson has just said, while we are only talking about $1 per head per day, I think that the tourist industry will be ever vigilant in terms of monitoring the progress of any proposals to increase charges. I know that over the years there has been some concern, but I believe that in Australia now, in most areas, we have a most responsible tourism industry. Indeed, the cooperation that has gone on over the years between the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the various levels of governments and departments has developed to a stage now where I think it could almost be said that some of our greatest conservationists are the tourist operators. That is terribly important because the Great Barrier Reef is one of our great natural assets and will continue to be one of the very great tourist attractions for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to see that the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) is in the House at the moment because I am sure he has briefed himself on the development of inbound tourism and the fact that North Queensland is poised to take some quite massive increases in the number of visitors who are coming in. We have seen enormous growth in Cairns. A speaker in this debate tonight mentioned that the industry there is growing by about 18 per cent per year. We are about to see Proserpine international airport come on line. If all the plans go accordingly there we will see international flights entering that particular part of the world over the next few years. There has even been some interest in Townsville as an international destination for charter flights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the House the other day I was interested in the dorothy dix question the Minister for Tourism received on the projections on inbound tourism growth for Australia.

If the Minister is going to set his sights on just $6 1/2 million to $7 million, I hope the country is not going to be caught short. The reality is that the Asia-Pacific basin is going to be the area that will literally explode in the second half of this decade in terms of international visitors going overseas. When we consider that from the Asian countries alone some 140 million people will be travelling offshore for their holidays by the year 2000, the opportunities for Australia as a destination are absolutely enormous. If we got 10 per cent of that business we could not handle it. We would be far in excess of the Opposition's proposed target of 10 million, and we would be in some very real trouble.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">p.m.&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, when we see the results of overdevelopment in some of the major diving and reef destinations of the world, particularly in the West Indies and in some of the Indian Ocean ports, we realise the dangers of overexposure to the flow of tourism traffic. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Environmental Management Charge-General) Bill we are debating tonight will, I hope, help in a small way with the continued planning of access to the Great Barrier Reef by members of the tourism industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the issue goes beyond the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park; it goes to a number of our national parks and the need to ensure that alternative destinations are opened up for the inflow of the great number of tourists coming through. While Far North Queensland, with the barrier reef in particular, has been a popular destination for Japanese and American tourists, it is now coming to the forefront of European tourist programs. It is quite interesting to move around the reef resorts and see the number of people, euphemistically called backpackers, who are visiting that destination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old saying that a backpacker was somebody who came to Australia with a clean shirt and a $10-note in his pocket, and while here changed neither, is no longer true. The backpacker&mdash;the independent European traveller&mdash;is now our biggest spender in tourism terms. The natural progression of backpackers appears to be to the north of Australia. When one looks at the projections, the reality is that there will be some tremendous pressures on Far North Queensland, the Northern Territory and, of course, Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for the Northern Territory and the Great Barrier Reef that we must have particular concern. While planning for access to the reef has gone quite well so far, one hopes that work will be extended and new tracts of the reef will open up for international visitors. That is terribly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen instances of overusage in the past. A number of those honourable members who are familiar with the area would have expressed concern over the years about the overusage of places such as Green Island. A number of restoration measures had to be taken there, and Green Island is now coming back as one of the major destinations. However, just as the Northern Territory Government is looking at opening up new access to some of the magnificent northern parks in that part of Australia, so too we must be looking at ensuring that we do not cut off the hand that feeds us. We must ensure that access to new areas of the Great Barrier Reef is fully controlled so that, while we do not lose the tourism inflow, more importantly, we do not ruin the very great asset that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thoroughly agree with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) about the contribution that industry operators are already making. I have never been able to work out why, when the fishing industry receives its fuel tax free, the same condition does not apply to boat operators operating in and out of the reef. When we look at an operation like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quicksilver</EMPHASIS>, operating out of Port Douglas, or some of the other Big Cat operators out of Cairns, we see that their contribution to Commonwealth revenue through the fuel excise is absolutely enormous. We hope that those operators will get a sympathetic hearing from this Government about any future charges. While the principle of user pays is a good one, we must ensure that we do not overcrowd the industry with charges to the extent that we become non-competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support this Bill. I will certainly be joining other members of the Opposition in monitoring the situation so that it does not get out of control. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to make a few brief comments in the debate on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Environmental Management Charge-Excise) Bill because time does not permit anything else. Firstly, I want to make some observations about the charges imposed on private operators in marine parks and other world heritage areas in Australia. There is a tendency for governments to set up world heritage areas in Australia without providing adequate funding to ensure that those areas are kept in the appropriate manner. There appears to be a great propensity for setting up world heritage areas in Australia, and I fully support their establishment. They are very worthwhile and contribute to Australia in tremendous ways. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), indicated, they are very attractive areas for tourism, and the Great Barrier Reef is one of those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when we as a parliament decide that an area is a world heritage area, we should at the same time give real thought to the funding of those areas, and not lob that problem onto the operators, five, 10 or 15 years down the track. If these are world heritage areas, then there is logic in our funding those areas as a total community, rather than having the operators fund them. The fact is that many operators are already contributing very substantially to government funding through fuel excise and so on. My plea to the Parliament is: let us have our world heritage areas by all means, but let us also give consideration to the best way to fund and maintain them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to raise moneys to support our world heritage areas in a piecemeal fashion, the administrative costs involved will probably outweigh the benefits. I suggest to both sides of the House that it might be better to raise those moneys through general revenue rather than continuing with the present piecemeal approach, such as we are seeing here, of adding a dollar to fares and so on. I am sure that the administrative costs involved for the operators and the overall administration&mdash;the government and departmental structures&mdash;far outweigh the benefit of a $1 increase. Furthermore, I do not see it staying at $1. No doubt it will rise, and rise rapidly. That will be just the start of it&mdash;the thin edge of the wedge. We need to think more carefully about how we fund our world heritage areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill, in some ways, is a mechanical Bill. It meets the requirements of the present Act that the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and related bodies be reviewed within five years of the commencement of the Act. As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) pointed out in his second reading speech, the five-year period ends on 30 June 1993 and the Government, not having already acted, therefore has no chance of meeting this deadline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment provides for another 12 months for the review, and the report of the review, of NBEET to take place, for the Government to decide what it will do about the recommendations and for the Parliament to act. The Opposition, of course, will not oppose this Bill because it is necessary under law that the review take place, and we would want to expedite the review itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a very long time&mdash;indeed, from the inception of NBEET&mdash;we have been critical of this structure of post-secondary education in Australia. NBEET replaced independent councils which were funded to have an independence of government, to put in independent reports on matters of educational moment, to make those reports available for public comment and criticism and for government to make determinations on whether or not to act on its recommendations. NBEET is a very different kettle of fish altogether. It has become essentially an arm of government. It is not sufficiently well funded in its secretariat and in its general funding to be able to act independently of government, and it is very much under the influence and the purview of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition also would voice a very obvious criticism of the Government in not having acted to meet the Act last year. The Minister said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at that time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the time when the review should have been announced&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it was clear that an election was pending and that the policy statements of the coalition and the Government saw very different futures for NBEET. The coalition undertaking to abolish NBEET was of particular significance.</PARA>
<PARA>I find it passing strange that the elected Government can decide within the 12-month period before a mandatory review that the fact that the coalition, its opposition, had a different policy on this body meant that the Government could not act. The Government was, of course, obliged to act. The Government is saying that it is the coalition's fault that this extension of 12 months has to happen, which is utter nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to consider what would have happened if the Government had met the imperatives of its own Act of Parliament. It would have been necessary to adjudge some time in advance last year the appropriate time for the review to be carried out. To do that, it had to appoint someone to undertake the review and it had to give some attention to the terms of reference of the review. This should have happened the best part of 12 months before 30 June 1993. So early in the second half of last year the Government should have been giving consideration to these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It probably would have been possible, if the Government had acted when it should have, to have had the report in by the end of last year. That would have given adequate time for the Government to have made its determination, acted and put legislation in place before 30 June this year. But the Government apparently had the election on its mind. That much emerges from the message in the Minister's second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government saw one of a number of scenarios. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there were many who rather confidently expected the federal election to happen last year. There were others who thought that was probably not so likely and it could happen at about the time it did&mdash;late February-early March this year. But then there was another school of thought that it might have been as late as mid-May. All of those were possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would have happened, if any one of those dates were chosen, if the Government had acted to review NBEET when it should have? Had the election occurred at the end of the year, even if a report had not been completed, the review would by that time have had many submissions. There would have been a great deal of highly critical comment of the Government, its actions, its structures and its policies in relation to post-secondary education. That is not the build-up to the federal election that the Labor Government wanted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even worse, if it had waited until March or May of this year for that election that it had not then determined, it is almost certain that the report would have been out. Indeed, if the election had not been held before May, it would have been necessary for the Government to have had on the table of this Parliament the amending legislation&mdash;and the cat would have been out of the bag. The public&mdash;or that part of it which cares about what happens in education in Australia today&mdash;would have seen a process of public criticism of the Government's educational structures and policies and it would have seen the Government's response. It would then have been able to choose fairly between the Government's intentions in this area and the Opposition's policy, which was to abolish NBEET&mdash;not abolish it just for the sake of abolishing it but as part of a tertiary education movement which was meant to lead once again to the growth and expansion of our tertiary institutions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the policy was to stop forced amalgamations, to stop government forcing educational decisions on institutions which would rightly be independent and, in the place of NBEET, to institute an independent body to give objective, critical and constructive advice to government on what it should be doing in the tertiary area. That was what happened before the election of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The old education councils gave good advice to Liberal and Labor governments alike. They were not at all uncritical. They were frequently critical, and I as a member of the Fraser Government remember some of those criticisms and would say that a number of them were justified in certain circumstances. The Fraser Government was responsive to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the present Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), has earned himself a very particular place in the history books of education in Australia. I think many people come into this place thinking that their names will end up in the history books. The fact is that very few do. Not even all Prime Ministers get much of a mention in the history books. It is rare indeed for Ministers to get much note taken of them after they have gone. Most of us are just part of a process. Nevertheless, I believe that the legacy of the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training will be a notorious one. It will be his legacy to this country that we have seen unparalleled dislocation, forced amalgamations, rigidity in the tertiary sector, lack of resources and an altogether dismal outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I firmly believe that even worse is ahead. We are long past the stage of bandaid solutions in the education area. The Government had a defensive approach to undertaking this mandatory review. It is because the Government did not undertake the review that we are looking at this Bill tonight. This clearly indicates that the Government feared what was coming. The present Minister for Employment, Education and Training has some background in education and, whilst I do not agree with everything he has said or done, I have an expectation that, because of his background, he will have a better appreciation of, and sympathy for, the tertiary education sector, and particularly elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called reforms that his predecessor brought in have left a dismal legacy. Tertiary amalgamations have had an objective of control, not development. They have been anti-education. Many times in the last 10 years I have wondered whether this Government had any sense of what education is supposed to be about and whether it had any sympathy for education. I know there are individuals who have a motivation in education, and I include the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), who is at the table. I have worked with him on House of Representatives committees on education. I know that he is well motivated. I fervently hope that he will have the satisfaction of serving in a government which will allow him to express that motivation and to achieve a desirable outcome. I hope so for the students, the institutions and the future of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe passionately in the importance of education to humanity. I believe it is as important in those countries where there are still, unfortunately, high levels of illiteracy as it is here. I believe that, when humankind is educated and when humankind has a trained mind, we are more likely to get reasonable and good outcomes in human history than has been the case in the past. It is so easy to manipulate minds that are either uneducated or that have been narrowly educated. Under those circumstances, it is so easy for the demagogue to lead those who are well-intentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fear that, instead of having an area that is growing, an area that builds on the high level of literacy, of creativeness and inventiveness, which has been a mark of Australia in the last 50 or 60 years, we are actually losing things. It is a common complaint from those involved in tertiary education that they are stifled and restricted these days. Structures have a lot to do with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a time when there was vigorous criticism and debate of what was happening in education, especially in the tertiary area, in Australia. The Government made good structures available to people for directing criticism and debate to some good outcome without predetermining what that outcome would be. That went when the old education councils were abolished and NBEET was set up. NBEET has a number of subsidiary councils that have particular responsibilities but, underresourced as they are, there is not coming out of them what previously did. I remind the House that those councils were higher education, technical and further education, skills formation, schools and research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far this evening I have talked essentially about tertiary education. Because there is a guillotine on the debate on these Bills tonight and there are others who wish to have the opportunity to speak, I shall be cutting short my speech, but I do not want to finish without saying a few words about the TAFE area. I am aware that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) is to speak tonight and I am sure he will have much to say about that subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is relevant to make some comment on TAFE when talking about the tertiary area. It is relevant for this reason: some 18 months ago, as I recall, when there was a particular outcry about the shortfall of places in universities for properly qualified students, Minister Baldwin came forward with the solution that the students that missed out on university places should consider entering TAFE colleges. As far as I am concerned, that is no solution at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is Minister Baldwin's view that we need some sort of, let us say, junior college system in Australia, somewhat on the model of the United States of America, then I would be interested to hear him float that idea and let us have a constructive and vigorous debate on this potential structure in Australian education. But he has not done that. He has tried to push down into the TAFE sector the unsatisfied demand of students in the tertiary sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say that there is anything wrong with those students going to a TAFE college&mdash;not at all&mdash;or an institute, as they may be called these days. Minister Baldwin made the point that they would probably profit in later tertiary education if they got there as a result of having studied certain courses at TAFE. For a number of them that would be true. The facts are that most students there would be there simply studying for the sake of it and hoping somehow to get into a university to do what they really wanted to do. That is a waste of money, energy and resources of the students and the colleges concerned&mdash;but worse, if you are going to push down that way, something is going to come out the other end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Minister Baldwin essentially was setting up was a situation of quasi tertiary TAFEs&mdash;or at least a section of them being quasi tertiary. The resources of those institutions being devoted to students who properly should not have been at a TAFE and who did not want to be there, necessarily must deny students who otherwise would have gone to a TAFE because that is where they wanted and needed to be, the opportunity to be there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government can talk about expansions of funding for TAFE but at least an amount of this has to be addressed to those students. As I said, it is not even a bandaid solution at this stage. It is a twisting, a distortion, of the structure. I believe that if this goes on, before very many more years we will need to seriously review the entire structure of post-secondary education in Australia. Along the way, however, the cost will have been very high. It will have been high in terms of wasted and lost opportunities for students. It will have been high in terms of resources diverted to a purpose that was not wanted and probably was not even needed. It will have been high because it will have been done for the wrong reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said a couple of minutes ago, if Minister Baldwin wanted to institute a system of secondary colleges, following high school, pre-further university study, let us say, then that is a subject worthy of discussion. I think it has a lot of merit. I am not committed to it, but I think it would be a useful examination and debate. But that is not the way it has been done and it is not the reason it has been done. It has not been done because there will be a better educational outcome. It has not been done because we will have better educated students. It has been done as a way of trying to disguise the Government's shortcomings in the tertiary area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wind up my remarks by reiterating that obviously the Opposition is not going to oppose this Bill. It wants to see that review take place. It wants to see that criticism take place. It rejects utterly that the fact that there was going to be an election, and that a different government could well have been elected, was a reason for deferring this mandatory examination of the Act. It says that the Government ought to take responsibility for the consequences of its actions. We welcome the opportunity to thoroughly examine the structure, the intent and the outcome of tertiary education in Australia today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my remarks to the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill which is designed to allow the secondment of an individual, who is currently serving as a Commonwealth or State public servant, to the position of chief executive officer of the Australian National Training Authority. This amendment is needed in order to ensure the appointment of the former head of the Victorian State Training Board, Mr Terry Moran to the position of CEO of the ANTA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to support this amendment because in my previous guise as secretary of the Federated Clerks Union, Victorian branch, I had a fair bit to do with the Victorian State Training Board and the development of industry training boards in that State while Mr Moran was in charge of that organisation. It is fairly widely acknowledged that Victoria has led the way nationally with respect to training in recent years in this country and the appointment of Mr Moran, and also of Mr Peter Noonan, to key positions within the Australian National Training Authority reflects this acknowledgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the mid-1980s, training in this country has undergone something of a revolution and I am very proud of the fact that Labor governments, both State and Federal, have been leading the way. In particular, my background as a union official representing non-trades workers, particularly in the area of office workers, who historically have been seen as performing work that is of low skill, of low value, and not really relevant to formal training, has been something of considerable importance to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the training agenda for the non-trades area prior to the mid-eighties, what we see is that training in this country was effectively in the dark ages. There was no serious accreditation structure, no obligation on employers to train their employees, no serious links between remuneration and training, and no recognition of work such as office work as being genuinely skilled, valuable and responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have to accept that trade unions, just as much as any other section of the community, be it employers, government or whatever, were just as much to blame for the lack of serious attention to training in the non-trades areas. There were, of course, well established training structures in the trades areas through the apprenticeship system, which had lasted for a very long time, but in the non-trades areas we were very much in an unregulated, unstructured situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it came to my lot along with others within the clerks union to consider the issue of training for office workers we found that we had to actually start by finding out what on earth was actually going on out there in the work force before we could even start to develop policy about how training should be conducted for skilled clerical and office workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of the examination that people such as myself and others were involved in led to some reasonably frightening conclusions. These included things like: the training at induction was fairly limited; large companies that performed in-house training operations tended to produce credentials that were not portable, not transferable to other work environments; many workers were expected to undergo training in their own time and at their own expense; office work in most of its forms was widely seen as unskilled, the sort of thing that anybody could walk in off the street and perform just as well as a trained person; training was often delivered informally by a co-worker, often by somebody who had no training as a trainer to be delivering that sort of training in that particular type of work; fly by night operators in particular courses, particularly in the computer area, tended to proliferate, while the quality and value of the types of training they were delivering were at a fairly expensive price, and in some instances were, at best, dubious; and the final feature, the most common training technique was basically, `Here is the computer. There is the on switch. There is your chair. Go for your life.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may sound a bit strange but I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in my experience in dealing with office workers that is an all too common technique or non-technique for training people in often very skilled and responsible functions. Naturally, those people tend to perform as best they can. Often it creates serious pressures, serious strains and difficulties, and the employer in the long run looses out because of an undertrained or an underskilled person struggling to keep up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Fortunately, this Labor Government and State Labor governments have pursued a range of initiatives in the last five to seven years, along with the trade union movement, which are gradually starting to address this problem. I applaud the Government very strongly for doing so. I particularly refer to the efforts of Laurie Carmichael, who has been a key figure within the trade union movement and in government circles, in getting people interested in these issues and aware of the critical importance of training in  up-skilling our work force and meeting the economic demands of the 1990s and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a number of aspects of various governments' training programs and policies. The first one is the traineeships program. I had a fairly hefty involvement with that program in my then capacity as assistant secretary of the Victorian branch of the clerks union. The traineeships program has been a very worthwhile attempt to spread something approximating the apprenticeship structure into the non-trade areas. It gives workers the opportunity to have both on-the-job and off-the-job training and in a way where they are paid at the appropriate award rate for the time they spend on the job. I have witnessed at first hand, in my capacity as an employer, as secretary of an organisation that employed over 30 people, the value of that structure because we had a trainee in our office. I have also seen it in other employment circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the House that the training guarantee levy, which the Opposition was committed to abolishing, has been a worthwhile initiative of the Government. I have also had direct experience of that initiative from both ends, as an employer and as a representative of employees. As an employer, when the training guarantee levy was introduced our organisation was obliged to comply with that legislation. This prompted us to translate what had previously been an ad hoc approach, with no overall planning with respect to training of our own staff, into a concerted, planned and thought out approach. We established a training committee with staff representation on it. We were compelled to pay attention to the broad question of how our organisation devoted that part of its resources to training: to which people, to what types of employee and to what ends. The training guarantee levy had a positive effect, certainly in our organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen equivalent effects in a number of other organisations which are perhaps of a more ordinary private sector, wealth producing nature, where I or other officials of my union have been involved in representing the employees. The consequences of setting up a training committee with employee representation have been improved staff morale; better direction of the training effort so that there is a better balance in terms of the needs of the employer and the interests and the aspirations of the employees; and the possibility of more orchestrated career paths for workers in that company. I suggest to the members of the Opposition who were committed to abolishing the training guarantee levy that, if they actually went out and checked in a number of places, they would find that there are many areas in industry where the impetus generated by the Government's initiative has in fact produced positive results for the company itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The award restructuring program, which has been particularly difficult for many unions&mdash;unions such as my own&mdash;has nevertheless had a very positive element of connecting training levels with classification structures and remuneration levels. The landmark clerical and administrative employees award decision of the Victorian Industrial Relations Commission a couple of years ago, which established a six-level structure based on skills for the first time in the area of office work, was a breakthrough in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State Training Board and industry training boards in Victoria have also been a very positive development. It is an illustration of the value of the work that has been done by the Terry Morans and Peter Noonans of the world that in the State Training Board we have Ivan Deveson as the chairperson, John Halfpenny as the deputy chairperson and David Edwards. In spite of the obvious differences of view and differences of constituency represented by those people, the State Training Board operates essentially on consensus and on agreement, which is a tribute to the efforts not only of the individuals I have known but also the key figures in the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the national level we have had bodies such as NOSFAB, the national office skills formation advisory board, which has played a leading role in pursuing the development of a common framework for office skills recognition across Australia. We have had VEETAC in more recent years with the development of competency based training and a system that is designed to be focused on being standards driven and pursuing outcomes as its predominant focus, and to be based on an assessment of competencies actually achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally in the area of training there has been the development of the network of skillshares across the country. I have about half a dozen of them in my electorate. From my observation, skillshares have played a very valuable role in improving the skills match between local workers and local businesses and providing job opportunities for people at the very disadvantaged end of the employment scale who would otherwise be seriously at risk of remaining unemployed for a very long period of time. Most instances I have seen have been quite well connected with the local business community, with a strong involvement in the orientation and management of the skillshares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only recently I had the pleasure of being able to visit one of the skillshares in my electorate, the RICO skillshare, which is an abbreviation for Richmond-Collingwood skillshare. I was called upon to present certificates to people who had completed catering and cleaning courses. In the presentation that I made I pointed out how pleased I was to see that people performing what had traditionally been regarded as unskilled or low skilled work that could not possibly be deemed to be worthy of accreditation were actually being recognised. They were performing work that had a significant element of skill in it that was worthy of training and accreditation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As somebody with a background of representing office workers, who all too often have had to cope with this problem of people feeling, `You are just a clerk, you are just an office worker&mdash;any fool can do that sort of work'&mdash;and believe me, that is a very common view in the community&mdash;I was quite moved to see the pride of these people, many of whom were very disadvantaged in terms of employment prospects, in successfully completing the courses. They were looking forward to quite reasonable prospects of being able to obtain work in the catering industry or as cleaners or whatever. That is a very good illustration of the value of the skillshare program. It is pretty cost effective, and a good illustration of the appropriateness of the approach by Labor governments in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it is worth mentioning, I suppose, that to the more ideological members of the Opposition this type of interventionist approach to labour market policy is anathema. I was interested to hear the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), with respect to the divide between TAFE and higher education. The fundamental problem that the former Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin), had to deal with was the fact that up to 90 per cent of people completing year 12 in States like Victoria were actually applying for university. Therefore, there was simply no alternative than to suggest that, unfortunately, we do not have a university system able to cater for an intake of 90 per cent of year 12 people, and logic dictates that some of that group will have to move on to the TAFE system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key issue is: what do we want people ending up doing? Do we want people to get law degrees in order that at some stage down the track they can be technicians, for example? Do people need to get law degrees in order to end up being a secretary? Clearly, with any of these issues there has to be a broad approach which matches in a very general sense the education requirements with the actual employment requirements of the economy. So to suggest that a pure free market is the solution to these things is a fairly peculiar sort of approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach of the Government, I am very pleased to say, has been oriented towards developing Australia into a high skill, high quality and, dare I say it, high wage economy. The Government's approach has been aimed at improving the match between the skills in the work force and the demands, in a labour market sense, of a rapidly transforming economy. The Government's approach has been aimed at increasing the recognition of historically undervalued skills associated with work that has been predominantly performed by women workers. The clerical area is a classic example of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a long battle which is continuing with unions that represent female workers to ensure that the traditional imbalance, which has defined work performed predominantly by men as skilled and work predominantly performed by women as unskilled or low skilled, is being turned around. For example, the very substantial skills that are exercised by a secretary, such as organisational skills and human skills that in many people's eyes are not seen as skills at all but ordinary day-to-day human activities, are finally being recognised as worthy of accreditation and worthy of recognition by remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Training Authority is the last stage in the broad approach of the Government to reform in the training area. It is a very positive initiative. It has inevitably limited powers because it is based on a consensual approach with the States. I have made comments about the federal structure in my maiden speech so I will not repeat them. I suppose we have to live with the current circumstances in dealing with these issues. I applaud the Government for its approach to training whilst labouring under those limitations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill that is before the House ensures that the new leadership of the Australian National Training Authority, originating as it does from the Victorian State Training Board, can be properly put in place and the very important work that ANTA has been established to do can be pursued. This is based on challenging the traditional and outdated notions of training that I have referred to and placing an emphasis on quality, consistency and portability. By establishing the appropriate structures the Labor Government has focused on accreditation, on standards, on assessment and on the use of industry advisory bodies to connect the role of training and people getting general education, as well as vocational education, to the needs of industry and to the needs of our economy as it transforms itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Training Authority is the last piece of the plan. It is to provide strategic coordination and generate national momentum, ideas and coordination in training. In my capacity as a trade union official I was very critical of the Government in many areas&mdash;not the least of them being industrial relations policy&mdash;but I am happy to place on record that this is one area of performance of both State and Federal Labor governments that I am very proud and pleased with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill which we are debating tonight alters the mechanics for hiring the chief executive officer of the Australian National Training Authority which is, at the present time, in its birth throes. As it stands the amendment appears unexceptional. The Bill provides for the secondment of the chief executive officer of the authority from a State public service or authority. The original Bill provided for the secondment of lower level staff but despite detailed guidelines for the appointment of the chief executive officer, failed to make any such similar provision for the appointment of the CEO. Therefore, the Solicitor-General advised that secondment needed to be spelled out in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chain of events leading to the proposed amendment, began with the appointment, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), of Mr Terry Moran which was announced last month. The question is why Mr Moran, a senior Victorian public servant, could not simply be appointed rather than seconded. This is a rhetorical question because I already know the answer. The reason relates to the superior salary structure for senior public servants in the State public services of the major States as compared to that of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed that Mr Moran's move to the Commonwealth Public Service would have involved a loss of income for him of between $20,000 and $40,000 per year. Although a couple of rungs below department secretary in the hierarchy, Mr Moran was in the Victorian Public Service earning in the vicinity, I am informed, of some $170,000 compared to the $120,000 received by departmental heads in the Commonwealth Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the $120,000 is before add-ons like superannuation, and the $170,000 includes them, because of the generous bonuses of the State service the difference in the salary Mr Moran would have received had he simply moved to the Commonwealth is still in the vicinity of $20,000 to $40,000, according to my advice. The Government argues that it must have the best man for the job, who in this case is deemed to be Mr Moran, and that it would be unfair to ask him to drop his salary. We understand that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) approached the Remuneration Tribunal to adjust Mr Moran's pay packet upwards but it said `no go' and the Minister had to go back to the drawing board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no quarrel with the appointment of Mr Moran, but the greater general public&mdash;large numbers of whom are unemployed, many for a long time&mdash;cannot help but marvel at the salaries of men who are supposed to be their servants. When the average salary in Australia is I think in the order of $31,000, $120,000 looks very healthy and $170,000 positively extravagant. One would be forgiven for thinking that it is just a tad insensitive of the Government to introduce a Bill to assist one man to a salary of almost six times the average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Moran's soon to be fellow Commonwealth departmental heads will also be forgiven for being somewhat peeved at the engineered disparity between their situation and that of their colleague. The principle of equal pay for equal work does not seem to be in operation here. Dare I say it, but to Mr or Mrs average Australia&mdash;who is in debt up to his or her ears with a mortgage on a house worth possibly a whole lot less than he or she paid for it when the Government allowed interest rates to hit 18 per cent a couple of years back, who is supporting adult children who cannot get jobs and who is stressed out because any day his or her own job might be lost&mdash;this legislation would look like yet another episode of Canberra's answer to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fat Cat and Friends</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to raise the chief concerns connected with the establishment of this new national megalith, the Australian National Training Authority. In principle, it seems a perfectly good thing: a means of raising the vocational skills of the population and of introducing some harmony into the national chaos of training. Cynically, however, I fear that it just another example of a Labor government's residualist, totalitarian mania for large totems, of which many see this House on the hill as another example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declared intention behind the Australian National Training Authority, set in motion under the Act which was passed last year and agreed to by the Commonwealth, States and Territories, was to establish a national vocational education and training system to have close interaction between industry and vocational training providers and to promote an effective training market and improved cross-sectoral links. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANTA is to commence its operation on 1 January 1994. Its board is to comprise five members appointed for five years by the Governor-General on the nomination of the ministerial council. It has been described variously as either a bank or a post office, with the States pouring in their vocational training funds and getting them allocated back on the basis of principles determined by the ministerial council and the States administering programs within guidelines approved by that council. The council, made up of one Minister from each State and Territory and one from the Commonwealth, is to make up national goals and decide the principles according to which the funds are allocated. Such, at least, are the bare facts. But how will it operate in effect?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some serious questions were raised during the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training last December when it met to consider ANTA. Peter Eggleston from the Australian Mining Industry Council testified that what industry needs is a decentralised and responsive approach rather than a centralised bureaucratic approach. ANTA appears to be just adding another layer of bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, it is premised on the idea of dealing with the supply side of training; that is, developing training profiles and national priorities. Peter Eggleston said that what had made mining competitive internationally was its ability to respond quickly to changes in the market and to implement new technology and develop new skills as required. Training, he said, should be driven by the demand side, by the marketplace. The test, he said&mdash;and this was the overall conclusion of the Senate committee's report&mdash;was that the raison d'etre of the authority was to improve productivity. Mr Eggleston said that, looking at the plan of the authority, one could not predict that ANTA would achieve any such increase at the local level. National profiles were, he believed, a means to a control system rather than the flexible system required by industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a view registered by the industry witnesses at the hearing that the national framework made sense in terms of providing consistency across Australia, but that it should be only a loose structure to enable decentralisation of decision making, curriculum development and skills development to allow a swift response to a local clientele. Mr Mark Patterson from the Retail Traders Association declared that industry was being ignored in many of the decisions already being taken. He said that when his national industry training council saw a copy of the draft legislation, it was refused access, although it had already been tabled in Parliament. Mr Patterson said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern is that it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>There are also question marks about the overlapping of areas dealt with by ANTA and by the national training board, by the Australian Committee for Training and Curricula, by the Employment and Skills Formation Council and by the Vocational Education, Employment and Training Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One witness, Dr William Hall from the National Centre for Vocational Education and Research Ltd, said there was a danger in that ANTA represents a non-representative level of government, whereas hitherto the training committees have been composed of representatives from the States, Territories, unions, employers and so on. There was little consultation in the setting up of ANTA. The choice of Brisbane as the headquarters was, as Dr Hall has written, `an example of raw politics'. It was fascinating to note that Dr Hall, in his submission, testified that he was `one of the few people who fearlessly write about this and express concerns in the media'. One wonders what others have to fear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we support the idea of providing a cohesive national training system, we are fearful it will only be another episode in the Government's drive to impose a rigid, central control via a national curriculum which, though claiming to promote vocational skilling, will actually hold it back. These changes are, of course, predicated on the destruction of an efficient system of vocational education delivered through the colleges and technological institutes until they were incorporated into the new mega-universities. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this connection, it is interesting to note the remarks of the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) on the national unified system given in a 1990 address to the University of Wollongong. He said:</PARA>

This year, thousands of Victorian students were unable to continue their studies because the Government did not fund sufficient places to meet the demand, and that demand continues to increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in Bendigo this year 3,933 students listed University College of Northern Victoria courses in their first three preferences, compared with 3,438 in 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister did allocate an additional 35 places for La Trobe University for 1993, but these extra places had to be shared between La Trobe University and the University College in Bendigo. That was woefully inadequate considering the increased number of country students wanting to continue their studies in Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact this year the Victoria Kennett Government came to the rescue of the Loddon-Campaspe college of TAFE in Bendigo and provided $9.4 million to fund an extra 500 places at the TAFE college and ease the shortfall of places. Where was the Minister of the day while all of this was happening? He was probably sitting on his hands and hoping the problem would go away, or that his Government would not be re-elected and would not have to address the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating Government has been re-elected and must now deal with the problem of insufficient tertiary places to meet demand. I wonder whether the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) has any plans in place yet to cope with the demand for tertiary places in 1994. Regrettably, I suspect he does not. Perhaps the Minister is hoping that the Victorian Government will once again come to the rescue and do his job for him. </PARA>

Perhaps he should make the effort to see first-hand just how much pressure institutions like the University College of Northern Victoria are under to provide sufficient places for suitably qualified students. I would be happy to have the Minister in my electorate at any time to visit University College to see the problems in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the Minister, through the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, should take more notice of the Higher Education Council. To my mind, it makes more sense to have regular reports on the needs of higher education institutions in order to respond more quickly to those needs. A quick response cannot happen when the Government receives only one report each year. After all, this Government has already shown it is incapable of acting quickly to solve a crisis that it has known about for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government's lack of action in dealing with problems like insufficient tertiary places is hardly surprising when one considers the origins of the word `labor' in Labor Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always inspiring to hear a fiery speech. Tonight I wish to talk about what I regard as another example of the colonial cringe and that is in the new-found obsession with foreign languages. Of course there is a place for learning foreign languages, but the obsession with teaching them across a broad range of students as a ready means of improving trade is simplistic and misplaced. In fact, it is just another educational fad that will pass with time, but which will lead to valuable resources being misplaced and misused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly those students who do not study foreign languages should not be penalised, particularly not in prime courses. Yet this is precisely what Melbourne University is effectively doing. The university has adopted a bonus system for the 1995 entrance which will unfairly advantage students studying languages other than English. As has been pointed out by Robyn Spencer in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 22 February 1993, entrance scores in maths and science for medicine are already 96 per cent. When the language other than english bonus of 10 per cent is added, this will prove decisive in many cases, if not in most cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A local Australian student without LOTE who qualifies in maths and science for medicine may still miss out to a student who scores less in these areas but who has LOTE. This is either a piece of fashionable stupidity on the part of Melbourne University or an insidious way of ensuring that it receives more full fee paying foreign students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Universities already effectively exclude qualified locals in prime courses, setting a local entry rate lower than it need be in order to attract foreign students. This is because foreign students pay full fees which the institutions can use at their discretion while locals are subsidised. It is much more lucrative for institutions to take foreign students. Foreign students already occupy up to 50 per cent of places in sought after courses in some of these institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many courses which are supposed to be making us the clever country. Locals are now to be further disadvantaged in accessing them because other institutions will copy Melbourne University. All we have heard about this issue from the institutions and their representatives has been misrepresentations and denials. Yet these are the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The institutions have also placed representatives in overseas countries to drum up foreign student business. The methods of some of them have been subject to sharp criticism in Asian countries. All they seem to care about is the numbers and the money. Quality and the best interests of Australian locals run a distant second. Far from improving our image overseas, these institutions make us look like grasping money grubbers. So much for those who worry so much about how we are perceived overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this sort of problem is not enough, we now have members of the Australian Tourist Commission wanting to open up tourism trade from China. The fiasco with the Chinese students did not do enough for these geniuses; they want to repeat it with Chinese tourists. I can tell the House what will happen if this goes ahead: many of the so-called tourists will lie to obtain visas, come to Australia and either go missing or claim that they will face persecution if they return to China. In other words, they will claim refugee status, along with the thousands of so-called Chinese students who have already done just this. The big difference is that there will be many more pseudo tourists than pseudo students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATC will point to the number of Chinese tourists coming in and claim that it is great for the economy. In the meantime, it will have to bear none of the costs of tracking down overstayers and processing refugee applications. Humanitarian lawyers, posturing journalists and the associated industry will have a field day defending the pseudo tourists and attacking the immigration authorities, who will have to come in and try to clean up the mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way things are going with the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) making approving noises, this stupid scheme may be accepted. Would the ATC be so enthusiastic if it were made to bear the financial responsibility from its own budget for any Chinese who overstay or pseudo tourists claiming refugee status who came in under the proposed scheme? This is precisely what would happen, because these characters clearly have no conception of the wider national interest. All they want to do is point to the numbers and say, `Just look at how well we are doing. Just look at all the tourists coming in'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address the House in response to the comments made on Tuesday by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). I am appalled that the honourable member for Perth, a former adviser to the worst government in Western Australian history, should have the temerity to question the Court Government's decision to close the Midland railway workshops.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decent, hardworking men of the Midland workshops have been sold out by the ALP in Western Australia, the party that so many of them have loyally supported. They are the victims of Labor's mismanagement. They have become the pawns of a Labor government which pretends to represent the interests of the workers but which in reality looks after only the elite of the Labor hierarchy and its mates. Men such as the honourable for Perth who sit in this House in their designer suits, who have never known what it is like not to have a job or prospects for one, should remember that if they are going to live in a glass house they should not throw stones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fascinating to hear how the honourable member for Perth suddenly put such a high priority on the jobs of 850 men employed in the Midland workshops when the Labor Party in Western Australia has downgraded them for the last 10 years. It was going to take 10 years to ensure the job security of these workers through the implementation of a program of upgrading and expanding the operation of the facility. However, the facilities were allowed to fall into disrepair with antiquated equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a cruel joke on the hardworking employees. Everyone in Midland knows that during the 10 years of the Labor Government the Midland workshops have become little more than a museum. It is a joke attempting to train apprentices, whose number is now at an all-time low, in these workshops. These apprentices have little hope of employment after training on outdated equipment. So much for Labor's practical belief in training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just what sort of a State government commissions reports, accepts submissions for reforms of workshops that could have been saved by an earlier injection of capital and expansion into the private sector market and then sits tight and ignores the options, all the while the Westrail fleet was being cut so that less work was required? The workshops lost $80 million of taxpayers' money last year and $22 million the year before. Eighty million dollars could pay for nine new primary schools or upgrade existing schools in the Swan View area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was typical of the practice of the Western Australian Labor Government that it concealed the full commercial realities of the workshop from public scrutiny, and squandered so much public money on WA Inc. deals, that the capital funds that today might conceivably have rescued the workshops do not exist. The Court Government intended to try to revitalise the workshops, and would have pulled out all the stops to do so, but the facility is simply too far gone after a decade of Labor mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This is a disgrace and all of Midland knows where the blame ought rightfully belong. If the honourable member for Perth wants to help the workers in his party, whom he has betrayed, he should get behind June van de Klashorst, the State member for Swan Hills, who is now actively supporting Westrail's redeployment task force. Already 250 workers have sought redundancy and 60 new local jobs have been found, no thanks to the ALP in Western Australia. So much for Labor's track record. Labor members are so far out of kilter with the Australian worker that they should be ashamed to raise their heads above their desks in this place. </PARA>

I want to raise a very important issue about people who are social welfare beneficiaries. Unfortunately, I am sure that every member of the Parliament has heard of the incident of unemployed people who have been found collecting unemployment benefits inappropriately, and who have been rightly prosecuted by the department. I make it quite clear from the outset that I rightly condemn such action, but recently there has been in my electorate a case where it was found that an employer, a company, was encouraging unemployed people to retain their social security benefits and to be paid cash in hand. What surprises me is that the department is quite rigorous in prosecuting the unemployed person and recovering the money, but there appears to be little in the Social Security Act that is brought to bear against the company or the employer.

<PARA>This amendment is to the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) which, whilst a lengthy piece of work dealing with a number of matters, fundamentally achieves its fame by virtue of the fact that it adds to the provisions associated with bidding for subscription television broadcasting licences a requirement that a deposit be placed by any of those bidding. It is necessary to deal with the Bill at this stage because, in the process which is under way at the moment, there is a possibility that clauses in the original Act may be activated which would require a reconsideration of the people who were initially invited to take up an option on a licence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) said, the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill has as its principal purpose the establishment of a condition for all remaining tenderers&mdash;if they happen to have a chance to become the principal tenderers for the subscription television by satellite licences&mdash;that they must pay five per cent of their tender as a deposit. This change was quite unsatisfactory in the view of the Opposition. It was a piece of legislation that the Opposition disapproved of and opposed.

The fact that it was not in the original conditions shows the incompetence with which the tender process has been handled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government then recognised that without such a provision the tender process was open to speculative tenders; it was open to the production of inordinate delays in the granting of licences; and it was open to processes which involved multiple reducing bids. From the public's point of view, the Government's point of view and the Opposition's point of view, the process which had been established was unsatisfactory. It was established because Senator Collins decided that it was sufficient exercise of his ministerial responsibility to sign the cover note of the determination and not to read the contents. What we have here is another part of the fiasco of the introduction into Australia of pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition opposes this because we believe it was quite improper to change the conditions of the tender retrospectively. Not only does it call into question the capacity of those who won the initial bids to obtain the finance to implement, construct and make valid and practicable their tenders; it also strikes at any future tenders that the Government might put forward.

The Minister gave us a lecture, in poor syntax, about the consultative process he used in developing the legislation which, it is my understanding, he intends to bring into this House in the Budget session. He said, over and over again, `I am consulting with the unions'. At the end of the day he had said nothing about how he intended to integrate those workers&mdash;representing 70 per cent of the private work force and 60 per cent of the total work force&mdash;who are not members of unions into this grand vision of enterprise bargaining. He basically had no answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my fair expectation that the Minister has no answer because he really has no intention of honouring the promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to 700 industry leaders in Melbourne some two or three weeks ago. The reason for that is that this Government, tied as it is and constrained by its formal relationship with the trade union movement, with the ACTU, is hamstrung in any attempt to deregulate the labour market in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent EPAC report states very clearly that if we want efficiency out of the labour market in an overall economic sense, then either we have an extremely highly regulated and controlled system which is seen to be fair or we deregulate the labour market.

They are aware that the widows pension is unlikely to be brought back in. They are not looking for that but for some more creative solutions from our Government to deal with their needs.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V5">Mr EVANS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Cowan)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (12.36 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your elevation to your honoured position. I rise tonight to address a matter of importance to the electors of Cowan and possibly to those other electors in marginal seats. Like other seats, on 13 March Cowan experienced a change of member, electing myself in preference to the Labor member, Mrs Carolyn Jakobsen. I have been very disappointed, even annoyed, at the difficulties I have experienced in the changeover of the electorate office from Mrs Jakobsen to me. In my view, Mrs Jakobsen has seriously jeopardised the effectiveness with which the interest and concerns of the electors of Cowan can be properly represented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Jakobsen, having had some weeks notice to make the necessary changes to remove herself, staff and belongings from the electorate office, had to be forced out of her former office by the Department of Administrative Services. In addition to knowingly and possibly deliberately obstructing me from the beginning to represent the interests of my electorate, Mrs Jakobsen cleared the entire office of every possible belonging and item, with the exception of filing cabinets, workstations and chairs, telephone systems and an answering machine. To paint the picture more clearly, Mrs Jakobsen took everything, including telephone books, manuals to phones and computer systems, information guides for electors, departmental contact lists, toilet paper and many other items that I as a member should have been able to use immediately on taking up my position as the new member for Cowan in the service of the electors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of more concern to me and my ability to perform effectively as a representative of the people of Cowan was the fact that the former member chose to remove from her office the many constituent files that had yet to be attended to or even acted upon. These electors have concerns that deserve and require the attention of their member of parliament, irrespective of their political persuasion. Given Mrs Jakobsen's irresponsibility and mischievous actions, how was I supposed to represent the interests of those constituents? Needless to say, the problem has now been overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw on my own personal experience with the former member for Cowan to highlight a much more important issue and one on which I would like to have my comments and thoughts recorded early in my parliamentary service. The issue is representation and the value which members place on that important and often burdensome obligation. Surely, each of us owes it to our constituents and electorates to ensure that a smooth transition of office occurs between representatives who replace former members of parliament, thus ensuring that electors are guaranteed representation on a continuing basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often mentioned in this place that our conduct is worthy of improvement and that our attitudes for respect for this place, its traditions and institutions are looked upon with disdain by members of the wider community. I agree with the sentiment of many that we owe it to ourselves in the community to improve our performance, but I wonder how effective we are in looking after the interests of our electors if I as a new member am forced to confront attitudes like that exhibited by the former member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote an important former member of this place, one who understood the importance of tradition and civic responsibility. In 1948 Robert Menzies, as he was at the time, noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Politics is the most important and responsible civic activity to which a person may devote their character, their talents and their energy. We must in our own interests elevate politics into statesmanship and statecraft. We must aim at a condition of affairs in which we shall no longer reserve the dignified name of statesman for a Churchill or a Roosevelt but extend it to lesser persons who give honourable and patriotic service in public affairs. Our electors have a right to expect as much.</PARA>
<PARA>My experience is the ultimate paradox for the constituents of Cowan, especially when the former member prided herself on `caring for Cowan'. Only now, only from 13 March, will they have a fully representative member of parliament interested in their issues and their concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, can I take this opportunity to thank the officers of the Department of Administrative Services in Perth, in particular Chris Palser, and the Australian Electoral Commission office in Cowan for all their very generous assistance to me and my staff since I became the federal member. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have almost completed my first two weeks as a member of this House. It has been a very interesting time. There are a lot of things to learn and a lot of things to take in. But I guess the most disappointing aspect, from a professional point of view as a member of parliament, that I have noticed in the last two weeks has been the absolutely pathetic and appalling quality of the Opposition's debating in this House, its absolute failure to talk about any substantive issues. I think the last two speakers from the Opposition, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans), are very good cases in point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today of course we also had the spectacle of the Opposition in Question Time failing to ask one single question of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I do not know whether that is a tactical decision or not, but it shows that those opposite just do not have the guts to let the Prime Minister speak in Question Time. One can only imagine what their fears might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last couple of weeks, I have listened very closely to the Address-in-Reply debate and debate on the appropriation Bills, et cetera. All that those opposite have done in those debates has been to try to re-fight the election campaign, to whinge about the Government's victory, and to complain about how the people did not vote for Fightback because we told lies, because we were dishonest and they were the only honest people. They cannot accept the fact that the people of Australia totally rejected their draconian, New Right, economic rationalist package&mdash;they threw it out; all they can do is whinge. They complain and whinge about their failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite cannot say anything constructive. They obviously have not learnt anything by their ignominious defeat on 13 March. Apart from trying to re-fight the election campaign two months after the event, the only other contribution they have made is to whinge about the republic debate. We cannot have change in this country. We have a Constitution that is 92 or 93 years old, and these people seem to think that it is absolute sacrilege to talk about any reform or change to the Constitution. How dreadful that people talk about change!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I joined the Australian Labor Party because it was the party of social reform and change&mdash;and I am glad that I did. The Labor Party is the party of ideas&mdash;ideas that it puts up to the electorate. It has been said in the past sometimes that we can be slightly ahead of public opinion and that we need to educate the public to bring them up to agree with the reforms that we put in place. But we have the Labor Party first, we have public opinion which comes along and eventually is second, and then we have the Liberal and National parties who are about 10 years behind. We have seen plenty of examples of that. There has been the example of child care. Suddenly in Fightback on 18 December the Liberal Party discovered child care as an issue&mdash;after 10 years or so. So those opposite had to exempt child care from the GST. They were a bit late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in speaking of those opposite, I have to give the honourable member for La Trobe points for courage. This is the man who accepted an invitation to be the guest speaker at a conference of the Public Sector Union in New South Wales where I was a delegate at the time. This is the man who came along and tried to sell Fightback, including his attacks on the public service and trade unions, to the Public Sector Union conference in New South Wales. I do not know whether it is courage or stupidity that we should give him points for. Tonight he once again exemplified his ideological obsession with attacking the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have absolutely no substance. They cannot learn from the fact that for over 10 years they have been rejected by the Australian people. Their anti-union, anti-worker and anti-ordinary people policies and attacks just have not been accepted by the Australian people. From their performance in the last two weeks, they have clearly learnt nothing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about substandard shipping. In 80 per cent of shipping casualties human factor is the major element involved.

We can have unseaworthy ships and incompetent crews, but not much happens unless somebody uses those ships. I make the point very strongly to this chamber that the users of those vessels&mdash;the exporters, the importers and the charterers&mdash;must bear a level of responsibility for the dangers they create for the lives of those seafarers, and for the world marine environment. </PARA>

Even were we not to use that contingent motion and pursue it, it would be patently obvious that in a week and a half's time, when the House of Representatives met again, the Bill would then pass in its amended form all stages through the House and, as a result of that, the Bill would come into force. </PARA>

To suggest that the industry needs this Bill now is simply not true.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact that the Broadcasting Services Bill 1993 has been rushed into the House with indecent haste this evening shows how desperate the Government is to terminate parliamentary discussion on this matter. Honourable members should have seen the smile on Senator Collins' face this evening with the sweat pouring down his forehead realising that the pressure was about to be removed because he had given into the Australian Democrats and had agreed to conditions which he did not approve of&mdash;and which he said in the debate he did not think were proper and the right conditions for the Bill. But he was prepared to agree to anything this evening. So we now have the Bill being brought back into the House.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) is at least sitting quietly and listening intently. It is good to see the Minister in the House. I noticed the Minister was not involved in the discussions to bring this Bill back into the House. I assume he was involved at some stage and was informed. But he was one of the last into the House and so perhaps it is a surprise to him that this Bill has come back into the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister was not here for the introduction of the Bill. As we know, the Minister was not informed by Senator Collins of the conditions for the independent inquiry and he was unable to answer questions that were put to him by the media hours after the conditions had been made public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is desperate to get this legislation through and it is giving every excuse under the sun: the industry wants it; the industry must have it for certainty. It is imperative that this Bill go through at 1.15 a.m. rather than wait 10 days until the Parliament resumes so that this House has an opportunity to actually investigate the provisions which have been placed in the Bill by the deal between Senator Collins and the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks, in the short time that has been made available, at the amendments to this legislation, one thing stands out with absolute clarity&mdash;that this legislation is the final humiliation of Senator Collins. We can understand why he was so keen to shovel it out of the Senate, back into the House of Representatives and through the Parliament. We remember last year how Senator Collins  obediently followed the views of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as expressed on that famous <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program with `Laurie of the Overflow'&mdash;sorry, Laurie Oakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He put the view that the Government was completely neutral in relation to technology. The Government was not concerned about which technology would finally first introduce pay television into Australia. In fact, the Prime Minister was deeply concerned that the Government would be locked into television technology; that it would be locked into a technology based on plastic dishes and that the superior technology of microwave television would be locked out by the regulations that existed then. So the Prime Minister gave his directive: the Government should press ahead with the introduction of MDS microwave transmission for pay TV. He assured the Australian people that this was a superior technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins, who has never entirely grasped the technology in this area, felt that the Prime Minister must know and so he went along with the Prime Minister. As the year went on, each succeeding month he told people that MDS technology was coming for pay TV. In November he assured the nation that microwave technology would be here first; that Australia would have pay TV by microwave technology before satellite transmission was available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what does this Bill do? It makes absolutely clear the reversal of the decision which Senator Collins has had to go along with in such a humiliating way. This Bill makes clear that satellite transmission for pay television will be introduced before MDS transmission. That is an admission which has been wrung from Senator Collins in the Senate this evening. This is what the Bill does: it gives priority to satellite transmission. So much for all the statements that the Government made last year. The Bill is the final nail in the coffin of the whole process over which Senator Collins presided for months and months until the Prime Minister pulled the plug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill exemplifies the total chaos that has been wrought in this area by the Prime Minister and his mates. The Prime Minister intervened, first of all, to favour one approach; then, under pressure, to favour another approach; and, finally, the industry is in complete confusion as to what framework will be provided. The Government is humiliated. It has got off to the worst start after an election that I can remember. I cannot remember a government which has stumbled from pillar to post in the way that this Government has stumbled over the last three weeks. Now, as I said at the opening of my remarks, it is desperate. It is desperate to get this legislation through, it is desperate to stop the debates in the House and it is desperate to do anything&mdash;to agree to anything&mdash;so that it can move on to some other matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect of this legislation is that it imposes a definite finite starting date for satellite transmission of pay television. This was imposed on the Government by way of amendments moved in the Senate and it is a matter with which we agree. Until this amendment was put forward, there was no obligation whatever on the licensees or on the Government to agree to a definite starting date for pay television. We have waited 13 years for pay television in this country; Australia is just about the last industrial country in the world to have pay television. Until tonight, until the amendments introduced into this House this evening as a result of the deal in the Senate, there was no finite, definite starting date for pay television in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment that has been placed before the House this evening provides that by 1 March, the licensees for the satellite licences must agree on a standard for transmission, and must agree on a uniform standard. This is to be welcomed because it does give us the prospect that there will be pay TV in Australia. If the agreement is not settled between the licensees, if a standard is not agreed upon, then it is up to the Minister to establish the standard. Of course, there is no time limit within the legislation which specifies when the Minister must settle the standard for pay television. And then the legislation says that it is not until this standard is settled, and it is not until satellite transmission begins, that transmission by MDS&mdash;microwave technology&mdash;can begin. So a clear priority is given to satellite transmission. But what happens if, when this standard has been agreed upon, satellite transmission does not begin? What happens if there is a further delay?  The amendments provide that if there is a further delay, by 1 December 1994 microwave transmission of pay television can begin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only two days ago, the Minister for Communications told this House, in answer to a question from me, that he believed that pay television would commence in Australia by mid-1994. Yet the legislation which was introduced here this evening holds out the possibility that we will not get microwave pay TV transmission or any pay TV until into 1995. So within two days, the possible timetable for the introduction of pay TV in Australia has been set back six months. The Minister comes before the House tonight and tells us that this legislation is to introduce certainty. Well, the consumers in Australia have absolutely no certainty from this legislation other than the fact that, by 1995, there is some possibility that they will have pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other amendments to this legislation which have been agreed upon by the Government and the Democrats. There is an amendment concerning cross-media ownership. Why this amendment is in this legislation, I do not know; Senator Collins does not know. When Senator Alston in the Senate raised the question as to why this provision was necessary and whether it was in fact just regulation for regulation's sake&mdash;which is something that the Democrats enjoy; they are probably the party most dedicated to regulation in this Parliament&mdash;Senator Collins said he could only agree that this seemed to be regulation for regulation's sake. But being so desperate to agree to anything, he agreed to it. So it has come before the Parliament tonight and the Government intends to force it through the House of Representatives this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is an amendment for an industry plan to cover all forms of pay television. It is provided that the Australian Broadcasting Authority must ensure the adequate involvement of Australian industry in program production. This provision has no tightness about it; it is a general provision. It seems to be meaningless because it is virtually certain that when microwave television, at least, gets going, because of the nature of that technology and because that technology is geared to transmission to particular communities and is particularly suited to allow communities the kind of pay television which suits their particular cultural or sporting interests, the production for pay television will have a significant Australian content. The generality of this provision is such that it appears to add nothing to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this was pointed out to Senator Collins in the Senate this evening, I understand that he agreed with it&mdash;that this provision adds virtually nothing to the legislation. Again, I emphasise that this shows that the Government was prepared to agree to anything to rush this issue through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a provision within the amendments for local content, and I understand there will be a review before 1 July 1997 concerning the possibility that some provision could be made to lift local content to 20 per cent. At some distance in the future it is a provision which certainly, if it were acted upon, would impose costs on the new infant industry. It is a provision placed in the legislation by the Australian Democrats because they are not interested in pay television which reflects consumer preferences. They have a view that they should impose a particular position on program content on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have before us tonight a piece of legislation to which it is very hard to give any respect. In only one amendment is there something to be welcomed&mdash;at least a date is specified which will encourage the early start of pay television. When I say early, I mean early in terms of what might otherwise have transpired because in this area Australia is, as in so many other areas as a result of ten years of Labor Government, at the back of the pack internationally. We are the last to come into this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are the first with digital compression for satellite transmission. The Government has supported, and now given priority to, a technology which has been tried nowhere in the world. It may be a good technology for pay television. It will be the first, as the Prime Minister said. One of the major reasons for the delay in the introduction of pay television within the last year is that no equipment has been developed by which consumers can receive these digitally compressed transmissions. There has been a long period of delay&mdash;a very long period in which Australian consumers have been denied the opportunity which has been readily accessible to consumers throughout the rest of the western world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is that so? Why has there been this extraordinary delay? Has it been a lack of interest on the part of the Government about the interests of the consumer? There has certainly been a general theme of neglect of the public interest in the way that this has been handled. Has it been that particular interests in television in Australia have not pushed for the introduction of pay television and have seen an advantage to themselves in the delay of pay television? These are questions that the public is asking about the Government's dilatory handling of this very important development in television which has come to the rest of the industrialised countries, but not to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, we have this piece of legislation before us tonight as a desperate attempt to clear this whole stinking fiasco off the Government's agenda and off the agenda of this Parliament. Hopefully, out of it there will come a system of pay television which Australians will be able to enjoy and through which they will be able to express their preferences. It is a piece of legislation which reverses the position that the Government has taken for some time but it is at least a piece of legislation which now has a starting date in it. Hopefully the presence of that date in the Bill will encourage the licensees to settle on a standard and to begin the transmission of services at the earliest possible date, which is in their commercial interest, so that Australians can have a fair go in an area where they have been treated with such contempt and where the Parliament has been treated with such contempt by this Government. </PARA>
