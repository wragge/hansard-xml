<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Office of the Supervising Scientist, which includes the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute, was established by the Commonwealth in 1978, following the Fox inquiry into uranium mining. The purpose of the office is to provide assurance to the Australian people that the environment in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory is not being adversely affected by uranium mining. The Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute has now carried out research on the impact of mining on the environment in the region for 15 years and uranium mining operations have been under way for 13 years. In this time, much background data has been accumulated and the operation of the Ranger mine has been relatively trouble free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the continuing public sensitivity to uranium mining issues, the need to ensure satisfactory restoration of mine sites, the special significance of the Kakadu region and the Commonwealth's undertakings to the Northern Land Council and traditional Aboriginal owners, the government believes that a continuing Commonwealth role is essential. Nonetheless, after 15 years, there is room for adjustment without jeopardising environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has decided to streamline and refocus Commonwealth arrangements. The decision was made following discussions between senior officers from Commonwealth departments, the Northern Territory government, the Northern Land Council and representatives of industry. I stress that following these changes there will be no diminution of environmental protection in the region. This is of paramount importance to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulation of mining operations will continue to be with the Northern Territory government and working arrangements are to be improved following consultations with the Northern Territory government. There will be no lessening of the Commonwealth's commitment to ensuring environment protection in the region. The Office of the Supervising Scientist will continue to play a key role in supervising and assessing any impact of uranium mining activities in the region. The essence of the changes is:</PARA>
<PARA>.incorporation of the Office of the Supervising Scientist into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, thereby reducing administrative duplication and achieving economies of scale,</PARA>
<PARA>.refined mechanisms for consulting key stakeholders,</PARA>
<PARA>.enabling the minister to seek advice from the Supervising Scientist on environmental matters outside the Alligator Rivers region,</PARA>
<PARA>.allowing the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute to undertake research on matters outside the region on a commercial basis; and</PARA>
<PARA>.establishment of an independent review of the research now needed to meet the Commonwealth's environment protection objectives in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An independent consultancy to review the nature and priorities for research needed at this stage of uranium mining operations to provide a basis for maintaining a satisfactory level of environmental protection in the region is being arranged. In recognition of the importance of continued protection of the environment to the traditional owners in the Alligator Rivers region, the views of the Northern Land Council, as well as of other key stakeholders, will be taken into account by the independent review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Implementation of some of these changes requires amendment of the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act and this is the purpose of the bill before us. The government has been working for some time towards strengthening its environmental management capabilities by consolidating various related organisational components. With this in mind, in 1992 the Supervising Scientist's head office was moved from Sydney to be co-located with the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency in Canberra. Complete incorporation of the office into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency will lead to direct and indirect savings in the order of $650,000 per annum from 1994-95 onwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the integration of the office into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, there will be no further need for the Supervising Scientist to have the powers of a departmental secretary under the Public Service Act 1922 and the relevant section is repealed by this bill. The Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region will continue to be a statutory position with similar duties, powers and functions, but will now be an office in the Commonwealth Public Service and subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act in relation to remuneration and other conditions of service. The Supervising Scientist will continue to manage the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are considerable gains to be had by setting the operations of the Office of the Supervising Scientist in a broader context and making the expertise of the organisation more available to others. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend the act to enable the minister to draw on the considerable knowledge in the Office of the Supervising Scientist to advise the government on environmental matters outside the Alligator Rivers region. I stress that it is not the purpose of this proposal to promote uranium mining development, either in Australia or overseas, but to enhance the quality and scope of specialist environmental advice available to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute will continue to provide the research basis in relation to the impacts of uranium mining in the region, it will also be empowered to undertake scientific research on environmental matters outside the region on a fee-for-service basis. By undertaking contract research, the institute could earn up to 30 per cent of the Commonwealth contribution to its research program. Thus the institute will be able to contribute more efficiently to the national research effort by making its considerable expertise available to others, while at the same time strengthening its own capacity for research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also establish improved arrangements for consulting with key stakeholders and scientific and technical experts. The Coordinating Committee for the Alligator Rivers Region will be replaced by two linked committees, the advisory committee and the technical committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advisory committee will comprise the minister's appointees drawn from key stakeholders, including Aboriginal and environment groups, and an independent chair. It will provide a formal forum for policy consultation on matters relating to the effects on the environment in the Alligator Rivers region of uranium mining in the region, as well as commenting on, but not changing, recommendations to the minister from the technical committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The technical committee will advise the minister on the continuing nature and extent of research necessary to protect and restore the environment in the Alligator Rivers region and on the most appropriate organisations, including the research institute, to carry out the recommended research. The technical committee will have expert representation from the research institute, Northern Territory authorities, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, the Northern Land Council and the mining companies. The chairperson and members will be selected by the minister. The government believes these new consultative arrangements will more effectively meet the needs of the Commonwealth and key stakeholders by more specifically focusing on policy and technical aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the bill before the House will provide for a more up-to-date, focused and integrated approach to protecting the environment of the Alligator Rivers region. It will also achieve cost savings in delivering this important service to the people of the region, the mining industry and all Australians. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1997 the Commonwealth allowed uranium mining to take place in the Alligator Rivers region. This followed the Fox commission's report which recommended such action. The Fox report also recommended the establishment of the Office of the Supervising Scientist in 1978 to research the effect of uranium mining on the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory. Since 1980 Energy Resources of Australia has been operating the uranium mine at Ranger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are five main points to this bill, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table, has indicated. The first is that the Office of the Supervising Scientist, which has been a separate organisation, will be subsumed under the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, specifically into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. In doing so, it maintains its statutory functions but the Supervising Scientist will no longer have the powers of a departmental secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill further widens the Supervising Scientist's power to give advice to the minister where he or she requests it on matters affecting areas outside the Alligator Rivers region. Probably one of the most important changes, and also the most controversial, is replacing the coordinating committee with two committees&mdash;the advisory committee, which was, I think, initially to be called the consultative committee, and the technical committee. I will say more on that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill allows the OSS to undertake contract research outside the region. There has been some suggestion that this will interfere with the private enterprise of other organisations in the region. However, the short inquiries that I have made would suggest that, rather than limiting work for the private companies in the area, this will actually expand the amount of work available to them. None of them at present really specialises in the type of work that the Office of the Supervising Scientist does, and the Office of the Supervising Scientist does contract out to private organisations. From that point of view there is no concern on this side of the House at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been consultation with the Northern Territory government on this bill. It has said that it is still not happy with the role given to the Office of the Supervising Scientist. It feels OSS is too big, has too many staff, and is much bigger than the Fox inquiry ever envisaged. I suspect that Energy Resources of Australia would share that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory does point out that the uranium mining is also subject to the Department of Mines and Energy of the Northern Territory. There is an annual report and two six-monthly reports by the OSS. That was the territory's complaint about the legislation, although generally there is no particular opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the introduction of this bill into the Senate I consulted with the Australian Democrats to see whether they had any amendments that they would like to put up at that time. They assured me that they were very happy with the bill and they had no problems with it. Subsequently, immediately prior to the bill's introduction in the Senate, the Democrats came up with six amendments, four of which have been incorporated into this bill. Generally, we agreed with the government's attitude in supporting four of the six Democrats' amendments and rejecting two. Consequently, included in this bill, the advisory committee has replaced the consultative committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern about the duplication, with the one committee having been broken into two, and what this will mean for the technical committee. The Democrats, on behalf of the environment agencies, wanted an environmental representative on the technical committee. It was deemed that that environmental representative would not be appropriate, although it was deemed appropriate to bring in somebody from the Northern Land Council because it was felt that the Aborigines had a definite interest in that whereas the representatives of the environment group do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the parliamentary secretary is no doubt aware, I believe there was considerable conflict between the environmental representative and the ERA representative on the OSS committee. Everyone was opposed to taking this into the technical committee, and it was felt that the function that the environmental representative was meant to perform would be performed equally well or better if the role were through the consultative committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no concerns as long as the advisory committee does its job. The right decision was made to appoint a member of the environmental committee to the advisory committee, and the opposition will have no concerns with the bill as long as that committee is taken seriously and its advice adopted by the technical committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other amendments, the Democrats wanted to broaden the functions of the consultative committee. We agreed with the government that that was not appropriate because it duplicated the position on the technical committee. We agreed on the formalisation in legislation of the appointment by the minister of a representative from the environment groups and to the words `To protect and restore the environment of the Alligator Rivers region', to maintain a satisfactory level of environment protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having covered the bill, I would like to briefly comment on the government's attitude to mining in the Alligator Rivers region. I find it enormously peculiar that this government can say that it is moral to mine in three places within Australia but that, immediately one opens four mines, it becomes immoral. I would have thought it was either moral or immoral and that whether one had three or four mines hardly affected the morality of the issue. However, the opposition will support the bill and the amendments made to it in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Amendment Bill represents a restructuring effort of sorts by the federal government of the environmental research and monitoring agency, the Office of the Supervising Scientist, or the OSS as it is commonly known. Essentially, the bill provides for the integration of the OSS within a newly formed Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, CEPA. It also reorganises the OSS committee structure, splitting the old consultative committee into two separate committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the surface, the bill seems to be an effort by the government to bring some order to the large number of scientific, monitoring and regulatory related agencies which have popped up over the years. The OSS is but one of these. There are a profusion of others, and I could see that some closer organisation of these might prove, in some circumstances, to provide a higher level of efficiency and less of a burden on the industries they monitor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More particularly, there has been an accumulation of evidence since the late 1980s, since the so-called Taylor review of 1989 commissioned by the then Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, that the structure, function and distribution of expertise within the OSS should be critically reviewed. The most recent of these was the ASTEC report from May of this year entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Research and technology in tropical Australia.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loose, uncoordinated relationships of the OSS with the Northern Territory government and the Commonwealth's own Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO, the dispersal of staff between Bondi and the Northern Territory, the poorly defined functional role of the OSS which has given rise to unnecessary tension between regulatory and research roles, and the peculiar and inefficient funding base for the OSS have all served to compromise its effectiveness. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am largely unconvinced that the bill provides any real improvement on all of this at all. The mechanical aspects of the bill give us precious few grounds for believing anything of consequence will come from its enactment. All we have is a few hopeful, if not heroic, phrases from the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the exercise provides for cost savings for the government of around $600,000 from the 1994-95 financial year onwards. But there is absolutely nothing in the bill or in the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) which gives a clue as to how the reorganisation is to take place, how the new organisational structures will cooperate or the implication of the changes for other current practices affecting the operation of the OSS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that this is a shoddy bill is an understatement. The bill has no detail at all and the amended version, as agreed to in the Senate, makes the situation none the clearer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would know that the Office of the Supervising Scientist has responsibility for conducting research into the environmental standards of the Alligator Rivers region, and especially so with regard to the possible effects of uranium mining activities in that region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The focus of uranium mining in the region is the Ranger deposit located just to the east of the township of Jabiru in a project area some 80 square kilometres in size which, despite some popular misconceptions, is not part of the Kakadu National Park. Ranger is run by Energy Resources of Australia, ERA, and has been up and running for 12 or 13 years now. It has pumped some $5 billion into the national economy over the past 10 years, and has developed some of the highest environmental standards in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore it came as no surprise to me that Ranger Mining has won the prestigious Australian Minerals and Energy Environmental Foundation award for environmental excellence. This was an achievement which should not have gone unnoticed in this parliament as it demonstrated that an industry can work in coexistence with the surrounding natural environment and that Australia's mining operations can embrace the principle of sustainable development in a practical way while others sit around all day talking about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ranger is a mine which off its own bat supplies about 10 per cent of the world's uranium demand, but does so whilst pursuing world best environmental practices. I think it was no doubt in recognition of this fact that the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee), in response to recent parliamentary questions I put to him, answered in the manner he did regarding whether he was ever aware of any environmental damage of consequence arising from uranium mining operations. It was a simple question: `Do you know of any significant environmental damage following uranium mining operations?'. He said he had never been made aware of any significant events whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There we have it: a mining industry in a sensitive wetlands area performing strongly but acting in regard to the best environmental standards. I would say that is fairly typical of the mining sector these days. Companies like Hamersley Iron have picked up awards as well for their research work on flora and fauna habitats at Marandoo, so it should not come as a surprise to honourable members to find that the recent IBIS business information study found that Australian miners were amongst the best in the world, not just when it came to production efficiencies but also in respect of environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of this, we do have an environmental agency in the form of the OSS overlooking the activities of Ranger. The coalition has no problems with the idea of providing for a suitably strong scientific research effort in areas such as the Alligator Rivers region. But where we do have problems is with the policy and organisation framework of such bodies as the OSS and its exposure to political pressures and special interests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And, as the Leader of the National Party interjects, we also have a very serious problem with the government's restrictive three-mine or two-mine policy in practical terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to the bill. I would like to pose some queries which the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mr Snowdon) will no doubt like to clear up in response to this legislation in the House&mdash;that is, if she has kept notes of the debate in the House following the recent debacle in her administration of the sporting and cultural grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, do not let me be sidetracked. The point is I would like the minister or the parliamentary secretary to respond to a number of specific queries I have in regard to the bill before the House. We have the creation, out of the old consultative committee of the OSS, of two new committees, one an advisory committee and the other a technical committee. We have had pressure from the Australian Democrats to do all manner of things in regard to the composition of these committees. It wants to pop the odd green lobbyist on a committee here or there. It would be a disastrous step, I would have thought, to politicise an organisation, the very professional credibility of which rests on its scientific objectivity and remoteness from the political world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important issue and I cannot emphasise enough the need to keep the research program conducted in the Alligator Rivers region squeaky clean of any political agenda. The minister will need to watch this like a hawk and ensure that the composition and the interrelationships between the two committees have one objective, and one objective only: the pursuit of the higher standard of environmental science. The minister must make sure that the advisory committee does not become a forum for every interest group with an axe to grind against the uranium industry. The advisory committee must be a responsible group of professionals and not a political arm of some politicised special interest group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said this, I would be interested to hear the minister's detailed explanation, in her summing up, as to how the dual committee structure is to be established out of the existing consultative committee. How, in specific terms, will this add to the efficiency of the current research effort? Or are we really just doing a variation on a theme&mdash;substituting one cumbersome organisational structure for another, with the simple motive that one is a bit cheaper to run than the other?  For example, who decides the research agenda the new body will pursue? Is it to be determined by the technical committee or the advisory committee? If there is some cooperative arrangement between the two committees, what policy process will prevail in this regard?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, it is vital that the technical committee hold sway in matters such as the design and objectives of the relevant research projects. If a so-called representative advisory committee grabs the driver's seat when it comes to the focus of the research program, then we will see all faith in the Office of the Supervising Scientist evaporate. It will be embroiled in controversy and it will lose the confidence of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This last point&mdash;the confidence of the industry&mdash;is not to be sneered at. It is a prerequisite to one of the further objectives that the government is trying to achieve through this bill. That objective is for the OSS, in its new form, to embark upon a fee for service program&mdash;that is, like other research agencies, the restructured OSS must gear itself to meet increasingly larger proportions of its annual budget by way of earnings from the provision of relevant services from industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the OSS is to achieve this objective, then it must be able to market itself and its technical skills to industry. If there is any hint or evidence whatsoever that the work of the technical committee is being driven by any political agenda, which may surface in the advisory committee, or that the research program is not being effectively targeted or focused, then that objective will be killed stone dead on the spot. I give this as a serious warning to the minister. I trust, like the industry, we will see good science prevail. This is doubly important, as neither the bill nor the minister's second reading speech gives any indication that the OSS has embarked on the construction of a business plan of any sort which will create a more industry relevant service arm of the OSS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, I would have to say that the OSS could not sell a newspaper to the industry&mdash;let alone an industry relevant and commercially priced service. That is not a reflection on the quality of scientific expertise in the OSS; it is just a reflection on the distance that the organisation has to go before it develops programs which are of proprietary benefit and commercial value to industry. It took distinguished bodies, such as the CSIRO, a huge effort to reorientate their programs to an industry focus. Efforts like that are not switched on and off; they require shifts in culture and behaviour, which demand very sophisticated and sometimes tough-minded management decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OSS has a long way to go. It has no defined business plan, a questionable organisational structure, and no proven track record in industry related service division. If the minister thinks that she can simply say to this House and to the OSS, `Go out there and earn your keep'&mdash;but at the same time structures the OSS so that it is incapable of responding effectively to industry&mdash;then for all intents and purposes the whole exercise is a waste of time and effort. Again, if the dual committee structure does not give primacy for research focus, design implementation and evaluation to the technical committee, then there will be no purpose and nothing to be gained in pursuing the restructuring to start off with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also make the point that the bill and the minister's second reading speech do not give much by way of detail as to the fate of the existing uranium oxide export levy which funds most of the OSS annual budget&mdash;from memory, I think the levy raises some $7 million from Ranger per year. What the bill does not tell us is that, if the industry is now expected to pay for services from the OSS, is it also to continue to subsidise the organisation through its compulsory multi-million dollar levy? That is a simple question; I would be delighted if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, who is at the table, could give us an answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ranger must fund the OSS through a compulsory levy&mdash;some $7 million per year. Now that it must pay a fee for service from the OSS, will the government keep the levy in place? If it does, Ranger will be funding the organisation by way of a levy, plus paying for its services&mdash;talk about double dipping!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the government has this matter under review, but the bill itself outlines no procedures nor any timetable for facilitating the transition from the levy to the external earnings. It would have been a more prudent policy if the crucial funding mechanism could have been presented in detail as part of the bill. Instead, we have a bill that is a hollow shell which anticipates undefined future changes in funding and does not even elaborate on how the organisational structure it creates will work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funnily enough, I am not surprised by all of this. The industry has seen the government move in this way before. Take, for example, the case of the Australian Geological Science Organisation, AGSO. The government has claimed it is reorientating AGSO to make it industry relevant. It claims it is putting AGSO onto external earnings requirements in line with other research agencies&mdash;perhaps others such as the OSS. But the reality of the whole exercise is totally different from the rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to think there is a fair swag of good science done in AGSO. Many of the research staff there are pretty well at the top end of the market as well. But government policies will kill AGSO, and the government and the Minister for Resources should recognise that fact. The organisation has had a fee for service requirement imposed upon it. Like the OSS, AGSO has no business plan in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the so-called fee for service, or external earnings requirement, is so structured that it is a destructive mechanism for AGSO which is serving only to drive industry away from its doors, poisoning relations with potential client groups. It has not opened up the organisation to increased industry interaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, government policy has breached an important policy principle in respect of the role of government in regard to baseline or fundamental research funding. Essentially, AGSO's so-called external earnings program is no more than a compulsory tax on industry. The petroleum exploration industry is being levied fees on its exploration permits to the amount of $10 million annually to pay for AGSO's continental margins project&mdash;a project designed to yield fundamental baseline data about frontier geological regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not commercially driven research, and the Department of Finance knows that is the case&mdash;it said so in its submission to the Richards review of AGSO last year. The continental margins project does not yield proprietary information&mdash;that is, data of commercial worth to industry. It is pre-competitive research at best. As such, I would have thought, if it were rightly the type of research that is of sufficient public benefit to be pursued in the first place, it should be funded from the public purse or through efficiencies or priority spending in the organisation itself and from appropriations. But, no, the government has dumped this policy principle and said, `We'll fund it through a compulsory tax on industry'. If I were the CSIRO I would be very interested in this trend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is backing out of any commitment to support an appropriate level of support for fundamental research. This is a worrying initiative by the government, and shows that it is driven by short-term budgetary needs rather than any stable set of policy principles, something so crucial to the conduct of the nation's fundamental research effort. Even more disturbing, the compulsory tax on the petroleum industry will only serve to divorce AGSO from industry. This is not a user pays principle at work because no-one is using anything. This is not a fee for service as no service is being provided. And it is not a conventional external earnings mechanism. It is simply a compulsory tax, and it means nothing in respect of the capacity of AGSO to gear its programs to industry and actually earn income from the provision of relevant services and consultancies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the only outcome of the initiative is that industry is about to walk away from AGSO. It will take years to heal the rift that is developing because of the misdirected push by the Minister for Resources to effect some savings from AGSO's not inconsiderable budget. I feel genuinely sorry that AGSO's staff and morale will suffer as a result of this poorly designed and ineffective exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsible minister&mdash;the Minister for Resources&mdash;has had advice on this issue. He knows the implications. He knows it is a wrong-headed and destructive policy setting. Yet he persists, against the interests of the petroleum industry and against the interests of an important section of the national research effort. So those honourable members with an interest in the OSS had better believe that there are some policy crises looming out there in respect of the research establishment&mdash;and OSS and its staff could well be the next casualty. </PARA>

It can comment on but cannot change recommendations from the technical committee to the minister. The technical committee will also have the capacity to advise the minister of the continuing nature and extent of research necessary. This will be in addition to the existing scientific and political advice that the minister has available.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect to the honourable member's concerns about a fee for service being paid by the Ranger uranium mine, I am informed that no fee for service is being paid. The uranium export levy will be abolished as soon as an alternative is negotiated. The levy is paid under the Customs Act and is based on the amount of uranium exported. It is expected that the levy will be abolished by 1 July 1994. As I am informed, there is no impediment whatsoever to Ranger with respect to this legislation, nor have any serious concerns been expressed by Ranger. Indeed, the whole process has been designed to achieve cost savings and greater efficiencies in the administration of this particular mechanism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to offer my congratulations to the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) and the members of his committee for what is a very useful contribution to the procedural debate in this parliament, a debate which has gone on for the 10 years that I have been here and which I do not doubt will go on for as long as the House exists. I am not sure whether we will find a perfect solution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report focuses in two main ways on some creative changes, one of these being the proposal for a main committee of the parliament which would meet separately, adjacently and in parallel to the House itself. The second suggestion is that it use the existing parliamentary committees to examine legislation. With regard to these proposals, the idea of the main committee has some flaws. I can see a real danger in that committee becoming an alternative chamber in much the same way as the Senate and the House of Representatives debates become not just confusing but almost have a dialectical tension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting that into the one House could be quite counterproductive. I am not, however, suggesting that it be ruled out of order as such. The methods that have been put before us in the report do not sufficiently prescribe the idea of the main committee. It would have to be much narrower, defined and prescribed when the committee reports back to the House for the idea to take a form that would not just become a replica or a repeat performance of what occurs in the committee stages here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the idea of referring some legislation to parliamentary committees has merit, but only for certain kinds of legislation. If that were at the wish of the House, that could be a useful way. But it also has some great weaknesses. The first of those, of course, is that the existing standing orders of parliamentary committees would need to be much better defined and much more clearly laid out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there would need to be some liaison between this House and the other place, otherwise we could have the farce of this House having a committee look at legislation&mdash;and then eventually as a House making a decision. That would then go to the Senate which would do exactly the same thing with the same people, witnesses and arguments&mdash;and, very likely, given the current political mixture, end up with an opposite decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would increase the level of scepticism in the community as to the role of the parliament. In that context, if we are to look at legislation in the external sense of allowing witnesses or people to come forward to address the committee or to contribute, it would need to be done in conjunction with the Senate so that what was then resolved would be seen to be the wish of the parliament as a whole, not simply one small part&mdash;albeit in a public and, hence, potentially dramatic, way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two other important issues raised in the report are the hours of sitting and question time. Before I go to those, I come back to what predicated the report. What initiated the report is basically what has been happening in this chamber in recent years&mdash;or what is perceived to have been happening. I say `perceived' because it is only in recent years that the chamber has been televised in the way that it has been and that vision has been available to the media and hence to the broader community. Even though, in my view, the chamber has not changed much in the time I have been here, the way it has been perceived has been changing&mdash;and not necessarily all for the worse; in some aspects it has been for the better. Anyone watching the Senate in recent days would be highly enlightened as to the relevance of that chamber and its non-contribution to the national debate. Many of us think that the televising of proceedings has in fact been quite positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the post-Budget period, when this chamber ruled out MPIs and censure motions, was the most productive time I have seen. We saw then more debate on legislation&mdash;and more useful and meaningful debate&mdash;than at most other times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People talk about log jams and timetabling. What happens on most days we sit, particularly halfway through a session, is that by the time we go through the MPI, the censure motion and all the grandstanding, all the day's procedures have been pushed back to the end of the day&mdash;and then to the end of the week. Debates that were scheduled for Monday and Tuesday get pushed back to Wednesday and Thursday and those scheduled for the morning get pushed back to the night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not so much a question of the rules, procedures or timetabling of the House, but of the way people behave. It is the way the rules are used. It is not so much a question of what is good about the report; the question is what openings the report gives for the forms of the House to be misused for political gain. It is not wrong to do that; it is not a sin. The opposition has every right to use the forms of the House to its advantage if it sees an advantage available. What is happening right now in the other house&mdash;the organised chaos there&mdash;is a correct use of the forms. Whether it is of political advantage is secondary, though there is no doubt that it is imposing a huge cost on the country and a huge uncertainty on the community&mdash;and it is certainly, I think, damaging the standing of the procedures of the parliament as a whole. But the fact is that the forms are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we turn to the main thrust of the recommendations, the main question is not what we can do to help the parliament or the House of Representatives, but how the forms could be misused. If there were a creative strategist in the opposition of any day, could the forms be misused to disrupt, to delay or to give the appearance of incompetence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the farce where, in speeches on Friday on the very report we are debating now, people were talking about the government not being in control. People were saying that the fact that we were even discussing the report on Friday afternoon was in itself a sign that the government did not have its act in order. Of course the government did not have its act in order. The people who were making sure it did not have its act in order were the opposition, with its numbers in the Senate. That those people tried to turn a situation of mischievousness and misuse of forms into somehow being a government responsibility is indicative. The fact is that the reforms proposed in the report can lend themselves quite seriously to misuse unless they are very tightly circumscribed. I have mentioned the two ways in which that can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report does not touch much on MPIs. I notice that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), in his contribution, indicated that he thought the government could have one MPI per week. The MPIs we have seen in these sittings have been so appallingly boring, dismal and irrelevant to what is going on in the country in any serious sense that they ought to be scrapped almost entirely. The name `matters of public importance' should be changed; they are matters of political importance to the opposition only. That is what they are, basically. They are not matters of public importance. They are invariably fabricated, they are invariably factored around question time, they are invariably factored around what those opposite see as a political advantage and they do not contribute to the total knowledge of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, MPIs are not enlightening; they are not debates that bring new information forward. Basically, MPIs are trawling old territory over and over on the grounds that the more one says something the more people may believe it if they bother noticing. The whole role of MPIs in this place should be reconsidered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is scope for constructive, sensible debate on broader issues facing the nation and MPIs are not the way to do it. In that sense the report is weak because it does not address what I see as being the structural problem. The alternative is to push the MPIs to 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock at night and make them the last debate of the day so that they do not disrupt the proceedings of the House at the important times when people are active and things can be done. I am sick and tired of having the consideration of legislation pushed back every night until late at night. Numerous times my speeches and other members' speeches have been rescheduled during the day to that night and then to the next day because of the misuse of the forms that are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question of misuse concerns the hours of sitting. I think it was quite remarkable that back during those months when the prohibitions were in place the House was very effective. I have never seen it work so well. There were no censure motions and such good debate. The fact is that the margins and boundaries were set and only certain things were possible. There is an argument that the government and the opposition could come to agreement on each bill. For example, they could agree that one bill warrants four hours of debate, another warrants two hours of debate and another warrants only 15 minutes because no-one will argue against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a large amount of wasted time in this House because members speak for the sake of speaking. They are not speaking on behalf of any constituency. Basically they are filling up what they perceive to be gaps. Why do we not have a system for each bill, under which we say, `In the overall scheme of things, this bill does not warrant 35 hours of debate in the parliament and the cost involved.'? People talk about waste and government expenses, but every hour of debate in these chambers has a cost attached to it. Already there have been 41 hours of debate on Mabo in the Senate and I gather that the debate will go for 48 hours at huge cost to the taxpayers. What new information has come forward as a result of that&mdash;what new amendments and new ideas from the opposition? Basically, there has not been one amendment at all and at what cost?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would it not be more reasonable to suggest&mdash;rather than working nine to five, nine until midnight, or whatever it might be&mdash;that for certain bills, for example, we attach a limit of four hours for debate? It would be remarkable to see how sharply that would focus members' minds on what they are putting forward. Speeches would become much more pertinent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one sense it is a bit academic whether the time is set at 8.30, 10 or 11 at night, because what will happen is that there will be filibustering during the day, censure motions and all the time wasting matters. The hours at night will be extended anyway. Whatever time we set, we will go beyond that time to finish off the day's business, as we have done every year for 10 years in my experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the report is useful. It is a starting point rather than a finishing point. As other speakers have said, there is not much to do in Canberra. As far as I am concerned, if we are here, we are normally in the House. I agree with a 10 o'clock termination rather than 11 o'clock because at least one might get to bed at a more reasonable hour. Also, if the sitting has to be extended, then the extension time will not be that much later. If the termination time is 11 o'clock, we normally go until midnight or beyond and that becomes common. I would argue in favour of a 10 o'clock cessation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other members have spoken glowingly about the use of parliamentary committees. The fact is that in the scheme of things there is no time for them. How on earth can parliamentary committees work effectively when there is no time for them to sit? Quorums or divisions are likely to be called whilst they are having hearings or meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the potential advantages mentioned in the report was that, if the parliament were serious about having committees, it should allow them to meet in a proper sense. All members of the committee should attend, but that is not the case, as we know, because of other competing duties that members and senators have. Finishing times should be prescribed for parliamentary committees. That way, our committee system would be more useful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is not so much what frameworks we have, it is how we use the frameworks that are available. The existing framework could work very well if all members let it. Question time could work more quickly if ministers and questioners acted more appropriately, answers were shorter, there were fewer interruptions, fewer points of order and the questions were more intelligent. The questions are invariably loaded for stupid reasons. When we have stupid questions, we get answers which are appropriate. The forms that we have in place could work much better if we let them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have two ideas for the committee to consider: firstly, rethinking MPIs so that there is a constructive debate each day, or every second day, on a much broader basis than we have currently. Secondly, having an anticipated debating time for bills so that members have some idea of how long is available for debate. It currently tends to be the case that a minor amendment is given the same time for debate as a major piece of legislation. Minor amendments are discussed for hours and major legislation often gets jammed up and guillotined at the end. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

On the whole, it has produced very sensible and reasonable recommendations which are long overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is both normal and sensible for any organisation or corporation to regularly review performance and procedures. Parliament should not be exempt from this process. From an historic perspective, today there are more bills debated but with the same number of sitting days. The report highlights the disparity in the legislative activities since Federation. For example, for each year from 1901 to 1911 there were 23 bills passed, with an average 25 sitting hours to debate each bill. However, in 1992 there were 264 bills, with an average of two hours to debate each bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note that the number of federal MPs has almost doubled, with an allotment of one-tenth the debating time per bill, resulting in an excessive use of the guillotine. One hundred and thirty-two bills were guillotined in 1992. A classic example of the madness is that the Senate sat past midnight on 20 occasions in 1992. I do not know about other members, but my brain wants to shut down after midnight. It is quite obvious that adequate time is not being given to the important consideration of legislation. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), who will regrettably be in this House for the last time this week, said that legislation is being passed through the Senate and the House `without being given the primary treatment afforded sewage'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the Mabo bill and the situation we find ourselves in today. This is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before us for a long time. It is a complex bill of many pages which not only interweaves with other acts, such as the Racial Discrimination Act, but also now has more than 230 amendments. More than 90 of these amendments have come from the federal government alone. It is understandable that honourable senators want time to debate the legislation in detail, yet if we are going to have turkey for Christmas instead of native title this bill will have to be debated and cleared from the Senate chamber in a hurry. This is a striking example of important and complex legislation being hurried by the government when more attention to detail in the first place and broader consultation in the community would have avoided the debacle we see today. Page 16 of the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time: bills, questions and working hours</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee is also fully conscious of the committee workload already faced by Members. Nevertheless the committee does see a useful role for standing committees in enabling greater input to the legislative process from the community and interested groups and considers that the possibility of such opportunities should be explicitly provided for.</PARA>
<PARA>The High Court Mabo decision was handed down in June 1992. The fact that 18 months later the consequential legislation is in such tatters is a clear example that the government has badly mismanaged its business. It should have been mandatory that this legislation went before a committee prior to final debate in this place, as is recommended in the report. I could confidently predict that many of the problems may well have been ironed out if this procedure had been followed. One of the greatest strengths of the Senate is the committee system. All too often, when government members stand up in this place and mention the Senate, it is in the context of having it abolished. Committees provide an avenue for considered and proper analysis. </PARA>

If we were to take a step back and observe, we would note an element of madness about the place&mdash;perhaps not today but certainly last Friday night and Saturday. It seems self-evident that sensible sitting hours are more likely to lead to sensible decisions, which is surely what this country needs.

<PARA>He says that weary decision makers `make major decisions when they are not thinking clearly'. Perhaps there is a clear message in this for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Freeman also talks about information overload&mdash;that the constantly increasing volumes of information being received by political leaders may be placing too great a burden on the relevant processing machinery. My Senate colleague John Herron says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of our body's functions show maximum activity by day and minimal activity by night . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He says that interfering with this rhythm affects `behaviour, alertness, reaction times and mental activity'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report contains many recommendations for improving operations in the House and the quality of decisions we make. I believe the recommendations that will impact most on us will be those relating to sitting hours. Revised sitting patterns would see the House sitting for an additional day each fortnight and rising no later than 8 p.m. Question time would be extended from 45 minutes to an hour. To cut time, ministers will be forced to shorten their long-winded answers, with a requirement of 16 questions to be asked each day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those among us who ask: how will we spend our evenings under such arrangements? There may still be committee meetings. There will still be work to be done.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For my own part&mdash;and I acknowledge it is stating the obvious&mdash;we need time to be able to read and absorb and develop new ideas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) is here today. I congratulate him on the work that he has put into this report. It certainly recognises the difficulties and constraints that we face when we start talking about change here. There are two aspects to change. One is the good working of this place and the other is the impact it has on Australian people generally. I do not think it would be an exaggeration to say that people in the community who do not have a great knowledge of the way parliament works regard this place as a joke and regard us as part of a circus. To some extent, that is driven by the procedures that we carry on with here, including question time, the public side of parliament, and the general running of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the public's great criticisms of politicians&mdash;I see and hear this time and time again&mdash;is that we are all out of touch and do not have a clue about what people are really thinking. I think that statement has some credibility. I come to Canberra and hear about the major arguments that make the national headlines, but when I go home and talk to people in the streets I find that they do not have a clue about them and are not at all interested. For instance, the furore not so long ago over pay TV was on the front page of the newspapers every day. It was debated in this House and every question was about it. The press ran it like billyo. I suppose the press had a vested interest in that matter because it involves its industry&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0U4">Mr HARRY WOODS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they are obsessed by it. Yet when I go up to Whiporie or Rappville or somewhere else up my way, I find that the people there think that pay TV involves putting two bob in the slot for it to work. That is what gives them the idea that we are out of touch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had the great debate about foreign ownership of the media, which I guess is important. But, try as we may, we cannot get raised in the media the issue of foreign ownership of our other industries. I have tried a number of times. For instance, there are no limits to foreign ownership of our meat industry, yet the press is not interested in that. The opposition is not interested in it because it sees the financial ramifications. We have got a limited interest in it through the FIRB. But when we look at the issue of foreign ownership of the media, it is major news every time. So I think there is a bit of credibility to the view that people have of us that we are out of touch with them, and we reinforce that all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could change that view if politicians were able to be in their electorates more, talk to people more and raise the issues that the people think are important. In that way we would not be seen to be in Canberra so much simply talking on issues that are raised by the national media. It is hard to know whether the media raises a matter first or we do. To a great extent I think we try to outguess each other. From the questions that the opposition asks at question time and the issues that we raise I think we try to predict what the media is going to run with. We try to predict what the media wants to hear, how it wants to hear it and what it is likely to give us a run on. I suppose I do it myself at home, but it is not a really good way of getting to the issues that are important, so we miss out a lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any change is good. I should be the last person to talk about procedures because very few honourable members know less about the procedures of this place than I do. I have never made a study of it. The report's recommendation of the establishment of a separate committee is a good idea because it recognises that non-controversial bills can be separated from controversial ones. Going a step further, one could ask whether we could regulate voting times on such bills. Such a move would be a major step forward because many honourable members find their time spent confined to Parliament House to be non-productive. Honourable members would benefit from having the flexibility of doing things outside this place without having to be confined to Parliament House. At present, honourable members are confined to Parliament House for all the hours that the House sits, simply because somebody might want to vote on an issue&mdash;although voting is important because that is the end result. The report recognises that the non-controversial can be separated from the controversial. I think that is possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also recommends that question time last at least 45 minutes, with perhaps two sessions. Ministers should be limited in the time they take to answer questions. But it would be very hard to do that in a qualitative way because quality answers demand quality questions. A question aimed at political point scoring will not elicit a quality answer but the answer that such a question deserves. People often value the answers rather than look at the questions and the answers and say, `A low quality question deserves a low quality answer'. Question time creates the public image of this place. It would be a major step forward to limit the time taken by ministers to answer questions so that the information sought by the question is put succinctly and credibly rather than in a point scoring fashion, which is really the result of poor quality questioning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation is that the Speaker be given the power to sin-bin honourable members for disorderly conduct. I do not think that would have much effect. In fact, some honourable members, particularly those on the other side&mdash;I would not presume to name them&mdash;would wear being kicked out once in a while with no further penalty as a badge of honour. Another worthy recommendation concerns placing a limit on the time taken to answer a question on notice. Any honourable member who puts a question on notice to a minister deserves a reply within a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some real problems now with the days and hours of sitting. There will be more problems with the proposed hours of sitting. For instance, should we finish at 6.30 p.m. on Thursday, country members who might travel for five or six hours to get here could not travel home&mdash;so they would get home at midday Friday or later, and have to return on Sunday. It would hardly be worth going home; yet, as I said earlier, that is where so much of the real work is for members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would prefer the hours of sitting to be in blocks so that we sat for seven or eight days at a time, including the weekend. Then we would be able to have a reasonable break, or we could add the weekend onto the two weeks or week in between. Although it is nice to get home on that intervening weekend, it really is wasted time. I view an eight-day sitting, all in a block&mdash;even though it is over a weekend&mdash;as being to far better effect, particularly when we are not sitting the late hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be pretty hard to have a seven or eight-day sitting whilst sitting until 11, 12, or 1 o'clock in the morning. But if we were sitting until only 8 o'clock in the evening it would be possible to put that seven or eight-day sitting together&mdash;and include the weekend. It is my view that the intervening weekend is really wasted time for a lot of members because of the travelling involved. The time would be spent much more effectively in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the issues raise problems for people who work here, but the point is really for members of parliament to try to use their time effectively. It is not used effectively now; certainly in my case it is not. It reminds me very much of being at school. I spent quite a few years at boarding school&mdash;which I did not like at all&mdash;and this is much the same sort of situation. One is driven completely by bells and procedures&mdash;with no flexibility and no real chance to use one's time as effectively as one might like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes can be made to make this program more effective. Many of the changes suggested in the report are worth while. I would like to see it go a hell of a lot further than it has gone, but I also recognise, as does the honourable member for Bonython&mdash;given that there has been very little change over many years&mdash;that the ability to achieve these changes is almost not there because of political influences and people wanting their own way all the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I would like to make is in regard to the number of acts passed per year. When we look at the table we see the number has risen dramatically; and I notice the primary industry portfolio accounts for quite a percentage. Perhaps one of the reasons is that repeat acts, relating to levies and those types of things, have to be presented every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of that could be done by regulation&mdash;and looked at for longer than a year. The minister could regulate it within certain parameters. There could be a five-year period before it comes back. That is one way of doing it. A lot of those acts passed each year come up time and time again. We should look at the longer term rather than the very short term we look at both politically and on the issues now. If we were able to look at the longer term on so many of those things we would be a lot better off. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence my remarks on this discussion of the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure by congratulating the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) and his committee on the work that they have done. I have taken the opportunity to read nearly all&mdash;I have not read every word&mdash;of the report that it has produced. It is a very good document and it will perhaps leave the impression of the honourable member for Bonython on the parliament for longer than he will be a member of the parliament. I wish him all the very best in his new career in some faraway port.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an interesting debate. I have listened to all of the people who have spoken to date in this procedures debate&mdash;I have a considerable interest in it&mdash;and it is interesting to note that both brand new members and old members have spoken. Some would say that the new members really have very little to contribute because they do not know much about the workings of this House, its traditions and customs and the things that it has to achieve over a period. Whilst that may be true, it is worth listening to their comments because they bring to this place and to this debate a fresh view&mdash;one not rolled up in the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those of us who have been here for many years, we tend to think that the status quo is good simply because we are used to it. These new members can bring to this debate a totally different viewpoint from which to consider these procedural discussions. So their contributions have been worth while as, indeed, have been the contributions from longer serving members. I was particularly interested to listen to the comments of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). Being the father of the House, with 30 years of experience here in the federal parliament and several years of experience in the New South Wales parliament, he can probably bring a broader and deeper viewpoint to the debate than anyone else in this chamber. Each of us has a contribution to make, and I am pleased to see that so many people have listed themselves for the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trying to come up with what is right, as the honourable member for Bonython and his committee have tried to do, is incredibly difficult. One would have to have the wisdom of Solomon to achieve the task of pleasing everybody. Indeed, from my experience over the years, one cannot hope to please everybody in this House. With the arrangements that it operates under, it is simply impossible. Each and every one of us has different needs. Each and every one of us comes from a different part of Australia. We have different family arrangements, different methods of operation in our own electorates and different roles to play in the parliament. So it is simply impossible to please everybody. What I think has been achieved in the recommendations brought down by the committee will please most of the people most of the time. For that reason, I say well done to the members of the committee and its chairman, because pleasing everyone is a task that is very difficult to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite interesting to consider the reasons we needed to bring down this sort of report. We have had a change in the way in which this parliament has operated over the years. We have moved from the old Parliament House to the new Parliament House. Whilst that should technically not have made any difference, it has made a difference. The fact is that the parliament is now televised; it was not televised in the old Parliament House. We did not have the technical capacity to do it. Here we have that capacity. Elements of the proceedings of parliament are now televised in a way that most of us are not particularly pleased about&mdash;we do not think it gives a proper viewing of what happens in the parliament&mdash;but at least it is now televised. That has changed the way in which critical aspects of the parliament operate. For example, I think question time has changed since we have come here and the place has been televised. Of course, the physical changes have also affected the way in which the parliament works. As I think the right honourable member for New England pointed out, this chamber is not as good a debating chamber as the chamber in the old House where we were much closer to each other and we felt there was an intimacy that promoted an exchange within the chamber that does not happen here. That is one reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the other reason we need this report is that the executive of the parliament has had a change in attitude over the years. That is best exhibited by the way in which question time operates. I believe the executive abuses the opportunities presented by question time. I have heard honourable members from the other side of the House say that this is, in part, a product of the questions that are put to ministers. But, ultimately, I think the blame rests with the executive, which takes up 99 per cent of the time during question time. It needs to take the lead in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few years the executive has treated the parliament with disdain. This is particularly true of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I do not think he loves the parliament; indeed, I think he treats the parliament as something he has to live through in order to be Prime Minister. That has had an influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This attitude has also come about because of the length of time the government has been in office. It is interesting to note that this is about the third generation of ministry since the Labor Party came to power 11 years ago. And with each generation of ministry, the ministers have become more arrogant. Some honourable members will remember the very early days of this Labor government when the ministers, who had been in opposition for many years, had an appreciation of what it was like to be in opposition. As those ministers left the ministry and people who had known only government became ministers, the ministry became far more arrogant and less tolerant in the way in which it operated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This phenomenon seems to be a product of being in government for a long time. No doubt honourable members on the other side of the House would make the point that this was the case when our lot were in government from 1975 to 1983 and prior to 1972. There is no question that a lengthy period in office tends to make the government of the day less tolerant and more arrogant. Therefore, that is reflected in the way in which the House operates. That is another reason why we need to make some changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we treated the House with its due respect and maintained the standing orders in the spirit in which they were made, there would be very little to debate with regard to this matter. There would not be much need for change. The only thing we could possibly be debating today would be the hours of the sitting of the House as opposed to matters relating to the management of question time, the issue of relevance, a second chamber and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That we are debating these procedural changes reflects the fact that the people in this House have not maintained the spirit of the standing orders to the degree we would have liked. It boils down to one critical element: all of the procedures and standing orders of the parliament are really only as good as the people who work within the parliament. It all depends on how effectively they want the standing orders to work. I think it is important for us as members of parliament to realise that all the standing orders and procedures will not overcome a failure by members of the parliament to make the parliament work. It is not up to the standing orders and the procedures; it is up to us to make the parliament work effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to question time, the proceeding which probably attracts the most attention and which is the area of most contention. When I first came into the parliament in 1984 we used to have about 20 questions a day&mdash;10 questions from the government and 10 from the opposition. We are now lucky to get 10 questions in total&mdash;five from the opposition and five from the government. The reason for that is that answers are simply too long. I note that the honourable member for Bonython made this clear in the report. I think there is only one answer to this problem&mdash;we need to impose a time limit on the answers given by ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some instances, a time limit can reduce the effectiveness of question time, because the purpose of question time is to seek information. If a limit is put on the time available for information to be provided, it can actually be quite counterproductive. However, the only way we will ever overcome the problem of lengthy answers and the other problem of question time&mdash;that of relevancy&mdash;is to have a time limit on answers. If a minister is doing the right thing and providing genuine information, and if it is the wish of the House to extend his or her time, that can be done simply by moving that the minister be given additional time to answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that question time in the Senate works far more effectively than it does in the House of Representatives. For that reason there should be some sort of limit on the answers given by ministers. That is the way to solve the problem. It also partly solves the problem of relevancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years, I have seen answers becoming less and less relevant. Ministers use the opportunity of question time to wax lyrical on any subject that takes their fancy. Their answers bear no resemblance to the questions put to them. Indeed, if we ask them about the weather we are likely to get an answer about the football. That is the extent of the relevance of some answers at question time over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Judging what is relevant is a tall order for any Speaker because relevance is a matter of opinion. Who are we to know exactly what is relevant. What is relevant to me may not be relevant to someone else. It is asking a lot of a Speaker to judge that, although over the years, Speakers have done their best&mdash;some doing better than others. A time limit is a simple way to overcome the problem of relevancy. The discipline of a time limit would focus ministers on being more relevant in their answers than they have been in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, a time limit will be put in place. Then, if ministers want to wax lyrical on whatever subject takes their fancy, there is an opportunity for them under standing orders to do so by way of ministerial statement. There has been a great falling off in the number of ministerial statements delivered in the House. They could be used more effectively without the time of the House being wasted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter of interest to me relates to the position of the Speaker. For the last few years I have been a strong supporter of the need to have a permanent Speaker in the House. I believe that no matter which party is in government the Speaker should remain the Speaker until it is time for his or her retirement from the parliament or until his or her voluntary retirement from the post. That would give Speakers a sense of security that they do not have at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that the Deputy Speaker should be a member of a party opposite to that of which the Speaker is a member. In other words, if we had a Labor Speaker we would have a coalition Deputy Speaker. That is one way of providing a degree of balance to the chair. The report has recommended the appointment of a second Deputy Speaker from the opposing or non-government party. I support that recommendation. I also note the role it recommends for the second Deputy Speaker in the proposed second chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the establishment of a second chamber. It is ridiculous that we are restricted in debate on contentious issues that come before this House while we have all the time in the world to debate matters that are non-contentious. Non-contentious bills should be channelled off to a second chamber for debate as honourable members see fit, and brought into the House for final passage. That would allow the main chamber greater opportunity and time for debating the more contentious items of business, satisfying the need of all honourable members to express their views on the very important issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as sitting hours are concerned, I am actually quite happy with the present arrangement. I am used to it. I think we all become accustomed to the weird hours under which this place operates. When I was first elected I could not cope for the first few months&mdash;I could not cope with sitting till midnight. I could not get over the fact that people 20 and 30 years my senior, such as Ralph Hunt, all seemed bright as buttons at midnight. Sooner or later we all seem to get used to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do take the advice of more experienced and expert people on health matters, such as Dr John Herron, a senator in the other place, who tells me that no matter how used we get to these hours they still do not do us any good. On the basis of their advice and the advice of others, I think trying the hours that have been recommended is worth while. For that reason, I support the change in hours. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) paid them great compliment, and due compliment, just the other day for the work that they did. However, it amazes me how they have coped when they were flying in different time zones. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Besides its implications for the well-being of the persons involved, this conflict with the circadian system has important social and economic implications, because night work is associated with substantial decrements in performance and vigilance, resulting in diminished productivity and increased accident rates. Thus, there is a crucial need for strategies that could improve physiologic adaptation to conditions in which an enforced activity-rest cycle conflicts with endogenous circadian rhythmicity.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important point from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New England Journal of Medicine</EMPHASIS>. Cecil's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Textbook of Medicines</EMPHASIS> claims on page 2356 that 20 per cent of people cannot tolerate shift work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have what are called circadian rhythms, which I have mentioned. They are slightly more than 24 hours long, they are re-set daily by light and time cues. There are day and night cycles, and in those cycles body temperature is affected, with the body temperature being lowest at about 3.30 a.m. and highest at 7.30 p.m., on average. Heart rate, blood pressure, ventilatory capacity, gastrointestinal activity and the excretion of electrolytes in urine are affected. These activities are higher during the day&mdash;and they are higher still for introverts like me&mdash;and peak in the late afternoon. There is a trough early in the morning. The peak and the trough coincide with wakefulness and sleep. I quote again from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New England Journal of Medicine</EMPHASIS> of 3 May 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Night work, which is voluntarily accepted by millions of workers in industrialized countries, is a major health hazard, involving an increased risk of cardio-vascular illness, gastrointestinal disorders, infertility and insomnia. The medical consequences of night work are associated with chronic misalignment of physiologic circadian rhythms and the activity-rest cycle. Indeed . . . several studies have shown that workers on permanent or rotating night shifts generally do not adapt to these schedules, even after several years. The inability to adapt appears to be due to the fact that the endogenous timing system that drives circadian rhythms is exposed to conflicting signals from the imposed activity-rest cycle, the natural light-dark cycle, and the schedule of social activities outside the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA>Walker, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Human Aspects of Shiftwork</EMPHASIS>, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Politicians and businessmen are advised to be careful in their decision making which may be imperfect at these times.</PARA>
<PARA>Walker is talking about jet lag, but he compares the effects of jet lag with those of night work and shift work. I believe that our decision making is impaired when we try to work at night and make decisions at night. Walker points out that the most important synchronisers in our timing are light and darkness, and our social habits, but that there are also secondary synchronisers such as ambient temperature. He reports results of a survey which indicated some drop in productivity on night shift in 39 per cent of workplaces. The productivity was much less for only three per cent, but there was a perceived effect in 39 per cent of workplaces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Walker also points out that there are two different types of people. There are the morning types&mdash;and I regard myself as one of those&mdash;who experience most interference to sleep when they work at night, and there are those who are least affected when they work at night. They are the evening types or the types who do not wake up very easily in the mornings and find the evenings more suitable for work. There are two different types of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if the late work affects only some types of people, surely we can come to the sort of compromise that the committee has reached. I believe its suggested hours accommodates both types. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Yossie Berger, a worker with the Australian Workers Union, pointed out the following during an interview on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> on 2 January 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Essentially, what happens is that the internal clock or the internal drumbeat&mdash;if you could call it that&mdash;of the mechanisms, the hormones, is out of sync; it's not synchronised with the outside world. When the light is high and intense outside, then your hormones are meant to do one thing; they're doing the opposite. That has a deleterious effect on your system, the various systems.</PARA>
<PARA>She continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The international literature reports that level of gastrointestinal diseases, ulcerations are substantially higher amongst people doing shift work. Also there are reports now, from Austria and America, that there are strong suggestions that heart disease, various ischaemic disease and cardiac disease, are also higher amongst shift workers.</PARA>
<PARA>Walker points out in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Human Aspects of Shiftwork</EMPHASIS> that more serious accidents involving loss of working time for more than 15 days, or partial or total incapacity, are likely to occur with people who work at night. All accidents are slightly higher, but the more serious ones are perceptibly higher. Also, there is a small but consistent tendency for ex-shift workers who worked at night to have a higher mortality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Walker also points out from a survey of persons involved in the navy that they are able to complete interesting tasks fairly well, even when they have been awake for up to 40 hours, but they are unable to complete uninteresting tasks after long periods of sleep deprivation. Honourable members would have to admit that some of our tasks, important as they are, can be uninteresting as they drag on. Walker also points out how workers can suffer in a marriage, in their companionship, the amount of assistance they give with housework at home, relaxation, protection of the family, mutual understanding within the family, decision making and sexual relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have dwelt at length on the times that this House operates. I strongly support the proposal by the committee for an 8 p.m. close and a 6.30 p.m. finish on Thursdays. These times are very sensible. There is nothing wrong with people having policy and other committee meetings. At least it will not need to be every night and it can be a personal decision made by the members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is that it is the newer members, such as the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), who feel the effects of the long hours. We have listened to medical practitioners who have been in this place and they substantially support the views of the committee. We ought to look at the example set by the medical practitioners who have been in this place and who have strongly objected to the hours. I can recall Dr Doug Everingham, the former member for Capricornia, giving very strong emphasis to the importance of closing this parliament down earlier. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) on the very thoughtful report that he and his committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure, have produced entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time: bills, questions and working hours</EMPHASIS>. I suspect that many of the government's problems concerning Mabo and many other matters would not have occurred had the honourable member for Bonython and other former ministers such as the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) and the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) still been in the ministry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, all is not lost. The former minister, the honourable member for Bonython, has been largely responsible for the production of this report and I hope that the parliament and the government look seriously at it. To an extent over recent years there has been a tug of war between the executive and the legislature. Unfortunately, in most cases the executive seems to win. Honourable members will recall that I was privileged to serve in the parliament from 1984 until 1987. I have noticed some changes in the period when I was away and, indeed, after I returned after the March election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give the government some credit for giving private members more time for their business. I know that the 90-second statements that we presently have on Thursday&mdash;and which I would like to see very much more often&mdash;have given honourable members on both sides of the House a brief opportunity on a regular basis to raise matters of interest to them and of interest and concern to their electorates. I understand also that there is now more time allocated for private members business on a Thursday. Honourable members can debate motions and occasionally private members' bills. My recollection is that honourable members did not have that same opportunity when I was in parliament before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very many good recommendations in the report but it is not a bipartisan report. A minority report has been produced by opposition members, but certainly the thrust of the report has been endorsed and supported by most members in the House. However, we ought also take note that, although a majority of the committee has brought down the report, there is no certainty that the report will be implemented. One only has to look at the Speaker's humiliation a few short weeks ago when the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings brought down its report, which was widely accepted. Indeed, in my view had that report been implemented in its totality, the quality of debate would have improved and the standing of the parliament would have been higher throughout the nation. I hope that the honourable member for Bonython does not suffer the same fate with this report as did Mr Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the first decade of federation, on average 23 bills a year were put through the parliament and I understand that each of them took an average of 25 sitting hours to deal with. At the moment in this nation we must regard legislation as a good thing because we seem to have a lot of it. In 1992, 264 acts were passed. But, sadly, because of the pressure of business and the government's refusal to have an adequate number of sitting days and hours, each of those bills had a debating time of just over two hours. The UK parliament sits very much more often and it deals with fewer bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am opposed to the second chamber proposal outlined in the report. I suggest to the government that probably what we need is not two chambers, but less legislation and fewer bills. If we were able to reduce the amount of legislation going through the parliament, then the citizens of this nation would be a lot freer. Possibly we should have a session just to repeal some legislation. The problem is the amount of legislation. The chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Bonython, saw the solution to this increase in legislation as having two committees. Of course, the other alternative would be to have less legislation and business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to deal with a few matters covered in the report. Everyone on both sides of the House agrees that question time simply does not work in this place. I understand the government will say that it knows that question time does not really work as well as the opposition would like. Had we won the election in March, the tables would have been turned; we would have been satisfied with the procedures and the present government&mdash;which would have become the opposition&mdash;would have been dissatisfied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As parliamentarians, it is time we take a stand for the quality of performance and debate in this place. It is very important that the Australian people get fair value for the many dollars they pay to keep this place running. Question time is a disaster. At the present time, we find that many ministers give longwinded answers. Many of those answers are ministerial statements under the guise of answers. Ministerial statements appear to have officially disappeared, but they continue in the form of longwinded answers. When a minister such as Minister Kelly is on the ropes, the message goes out to the frontbenchers, `Filibuster, take as long as you can, squander and waste as much question time as you can and some way or another we'll get through this without the minister being sacked'&mdash;as she should have been because of the sports rorts affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even when we do not have ministers under great stress, we still find that a tradition has grown up in this place whereby answers are longwinded, not relevant and do not even answer the question. I am very pleased that the honourable member for Bonython and his committee have included a requirement that question time should be at least 45 minutes; although I would prefer at least 60 minutes, or two periods of 30 minutes with a minimum number of questions&mdash;16, I think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal for supplementary questions is excellent. We can all recall how the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) was, in effect, reeling from the opposition attack in recent times. Had it been possible for honourable members asking a question of the minister to follow up with a supplementary question, the people and the parliament might have obtained the answers they were entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is also important that question time is not held too late to be covered on the various news services. If it is too late, a lot of the purpose of question time&mdash;which is to obtain information from ministers&mdash;will not be achieved. There has been a suggestion that ministers go on and on with their answers because of the disruption from this side of the House. The reality&mdash;and I can see the honourable member for Charlton nodding; he would probably agree with me&mdash;is a chicken and egg situation. If a question were asked of a minister, and a concise answer conveying information were given, there would be no reason for us to become restless or take the very appropriate points of order so regularly taken by us. It is time to go back to the drawing board and look at this whole question. I commend the committee on its suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most honourable members will recall the contribution made by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) last week in this debate when he said that the worst job in this place is to be a government backbencher. The second worst job is to be an opposition backbencher. The real problem that all backbench members have is that these days we get very few opportunities to ask questions. My observation is that the government has a list of structured questions on its side of the parliament. The honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) hands out the lists of those Labor backbench members who are to ask questions without notice&mdash;or supposedly without notice&mdash;of ministers. In reality, most of them are dorothy dixers. That is probably the way it was while we were in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members will notice that our whips go around and hand out to us a similar list of questions. Unfortunately, many of our questions are taken up by the frontbench, so the backbenchers get little opportunity to ask questions. I know that both sides could say, `Okay, we're going to have a limited number of structured questions and then there will be opportunities for the backbench', but it never seems to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my previous term in the parliament, I noticed a similar situation. It is an ongoing problem, but it should be looked at. Question time is designed to get answers from ministers. Quite often, an unstructured question from an opposition backbencher can throw a minister in a way that questions from the frontbench never seem to. A lot of backbenchers on both sides of the House feel that</PARA>
<PARA>they are division fodder. Ministers and opposition executive members would probably agree&mdash;in a private moment&mdash;that that is the case. Backbenchers are required to come in and vote. Unfortunately, most of the activity in the parliament is handled by those on the frontbench on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am opposed to the rostering of ministers. I can understand that if the parliament were sitting much more it would be reasonable for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) not to be here every day. For instance, at Westminster, where the parliament sits many days, it is perfectly reasonable for the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom not to be in the parliament every day. Because we sit such a small number of days&mdash;I think we sit for approximately 60 or 70 days, or have done in the past&mdash;I do not believe that it is at all unreasonable for the Prime Minister and all ministers to be in the parliament, so they may be held to account for the government's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very good idea to give more power to the Speaker, provided the neutrality of the Speaker can be guaranteed. I am also attracted to the UK proposition where the Speaker is apolitical; resigns from his or her party; has no further party involvement; and, at the next election, his or her seat is not contested by the major parties. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the father of the House, mentioned guaranteeing the endorsement of Speakers if we do not follow the complete UK system. In my view, that would not be adequate to guarantee neutrality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the UK, Speakers usually see this position as the culmination of a parliamentary career. I believe that a retiring Speaker is elevated to the peerage and made a viscount. In Australia, our Speakers often look at the speakership as part of a career path. The honourable member for Watson has become the government whip&mdash;I am not certain whether he sees that as a step up or down. Our Speaker could have ministerial capacities. I would not be surprised to see him move in that direction in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor Speakers find it very hard to be as neutral as Liberal-National Party Speakers. All of them would have eyes on the precedent of Speaker Cope during the time of the Whitlam government.

We might even see some government members sent out for a short time. </PARA>

That should also be considered in addition to the time we are in the parliament. It is a great idea to finish at 8 p.m, although it is important that we continue the adjournment debate because that gives honourable members the opportunity to raise matters of local concern.

All of the work which takes place here and outside of this chamber is to make sure that this chamber operates efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the honourable member for Bonython and his colleagues applied themselves to. I think it is a great report. There are some elements that I would not necessarily endorse, but we have got to give serious consideration to it. We have to make sure that we utilise the time which is available to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone referred correctly to the fact that next year we are scheduling 60 sitting days. There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in the year and two days in each weekend. So take out 104 days for a start. Then give consideration to the amount of time that we have to spend in our electorate offices meeting with constituents, attending to the functions that we are not legally required to attend&mdash;all of those things that we are not required to do. As members of this parliament we are legally required to attend meetings of the parliament in this chamber&mdash;full stop. So when people rubbish their members of parliament for not doing what they perhaps think their members should be doing, those people should keep in mind&mdash;I say this without any reservations and with no apologies&mdash;that the legal requirement for members of parliament is to attend the sittings of parliament in this chamber. Everything else that honourable members do is because they want to service their electorate and their constituents, and they do a good job. That includes those opposite and members on the government side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons that we sometimes have a disrupted question time is that honourable members are generally passionate people with passionate concerns about issues. If they feel frustrated when they are here, I do not suppose it is surprising that sometimes this place erupts. We would need to start examining the passion of our concerns if it were not to do so. In that context we need to examine, as the committee has, the way in which this chamber will do the job expected of it in the most efficient way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year we will sit for 21 weeks of the 52. That means that the House will not be sitting for 31 weeks. Every member of this chamber will have more than enough to do to fill up his or her time in those 31 weeks. Their constituents will see them back in their electorates attending to all of those other things that have to be done. There is a high level of expectation, rightfully so, in the electorate that local members of parliament be visible, involved in issues, accessible and responsive&mdash;on some occasions, they will lead their communities in dealing with issues. </PARA>

There might be a lot that is wrong with this system and there are many people who say it is an expensive system&mdash;and it is a very expensive system&mdash;but it is a damn sight better than any alternative that we have seen hitherto. There is all the work of committees and of individual members in this chamber. We are all members of political parties. Political parties are fundamental to successful, effective liberal democracies. We have responsibilities to those parties. When we are out developing and promoting policies, raising funds, maintaining contacts, visiting branches, looking after our own branches and looking after our own federal electorate councils, we are doing things that are of fundamental importance to the way in which the parliament operates, and this chamber is of fundamental importance to that central requirement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to comment on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure. I take the opportunity to congratulate the chairman, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), and also my own colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who was the deputy chairman of that committee, on bringing this report before the House. It is a very important issue and one which should be addressed from time to time. The basis of the report is not about making life on Capital Hill more comfortable for executive government and it is certainly not about making it more comfortable for honourable members. The purpose of parliament, quite clearly, should be to ensure that the wishes of the people are reflected in the legislation which is brought before the House. That legislation needs to be scrutinised, examined, tipped upside down and debated thoroughly before being implemented into law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past few years, executive government has taken total control of the legislative processes. Unfortunately, the examination of legislation does not receive the close attention that it did in previous parliaments. That has been to the detriment of the Australian community. The content of legislative changes, naturally, has to be transmitted to the community. Because of advances in technology in the past few years, people are much better informed about the parliamentary processes and debates than they have ever been before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of major problems I wish to comment on, one being the volume of the legislative program. There is the seeming and apparent need of the executive to keep on bringing more and more legislation before the parliament, and this is overwhelming. In fact, Australia is overregulated and overlegislated and there is too much too often when other solutions could be used. One problem is the sheer volume of legislation. The resort to legislative processes by many governments is probably an easy way out rather than trying to solve problems without bringing the legislation into the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem, drawn to my attention by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), is the level of fitness of members of parliament and the range of involvement that they have particularly while the House is sitting. Also, because of the demands they have in their electorates, huge demands are placed on honourable members. I think that the demands have grown as the legislative program has increased. The pressures in running an electorate have mounted at about the same rate. There is an enormous amount to be done both here and in the electorate. For honourable members to maintain their commitment to the processes in this House and to their electorates requires a fairly high level of fitness which we have great difficulty in achieving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do all the wrong things. In our eating habits, we sometimes eat too much at the wrong time. Sometimes we eat less and even skip meals. We dart from one meeting to the next, often with a sandwich in our hands. On many occasions we go through a whole day and, when it gets to 11 o'clock or midnight, we realise that we have had only one meal for the day, which was breakfast. I think we have similar problems with our exercise habits. We start with good intentions. I certainly do. I start with the intention of having a swim every day. Sometimes I have a swim but, as the week progresses and I get busier and busier, I miss out on that exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes we have too many meetings. We have meetings over lunch and over dinner when we have a sandwich. There are times when people should be getting some exercise to try to get their fitness levels up. We all restrict our sleeping time. I run on about four to five hours sleep per night and have been doing so for years. I do not know whether that is good or bad. My colleague Dr John Herron in the Senate says it is bad for us, and it probably is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sheer volume of legislation is the starting point of these additional pressures. The executive needs to examine this by going back and looking at whether it is absolutely necessary to have as much legislation or whether there are other mechanisms to achieve the same results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question time is vitally important to an opposition and the public because it is the one major opportunity where parliament holds the executive accountable for its actions to the Australian public. I noted with great interest recommendation No. 98, but I want to put another option to the chairman&mdash;and I am pleased that the honourable member for Bonython is present. To achieve more accountability in question time, the committee could have recommended a mixture of the practice adopted in the House of Commons with what happens here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question time should present honourable members with the ability to give a minister two hours' notice in writing, to give him or her the subject of the question, and the original questioner should be allowed two supplementary questions. The next stage would give a choice to the party concerned of whether the original questioner would ask a further question on that topic, followed by another opportunity for two supplementary questions. If the original questioner declined that option then a further five questions on new subjects could be put to the executive to make it accountable. That would still mean eight questions would be allotted the government and non-government parties. So the committee's original recommendation of 16 questions would fit that framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen question time in the House of Commons. I was impressed by the procedure there where a minister is given some notice of a question so that that minister is tested on his or her knowledge of the subject and the portfolio, and a series of supplementary questions are used to derive worthwhile information to better inform the public. Such a question time would represent a mixture of the present practice here and in the House of Commons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation No. 115 on page 29 of the report deals with the 90-day rule on questions without notice. The committee recommended that, if a question has been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> longer than 90 days, a letter be written by the Speaker to the minister concerned seeking reasons for the delay in answering the question. That would be like throwing confetti at the Town Hall&mdash;it would not have much impact on a minister because he could give a thousand different reasons why he or his department could not answer the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that, if a question on notice is not answered within 90 days, the honourable member should be given a free question in the House. On the next sitting day the honourable member should be able to come into the House and ask that question which the minister has made no attempt to answer. The honourable member should be able to ask a question of that minister and not suffer any penalty in the House because that question would not be included in the 16 questions allotted per day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has set down 16 as being the mandatory number of questions for question time. I am suggesting that, where a minister does not bother to answer a question on notice, the honourable member would have another opportunity to ask that exact question in the House to get a response from the minister. That would be a severe penalty because it would restrict the number of dorothy dix questions the government could ask. I also noted the dissenting report by my colleagues, for which I commend them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleagues did well&mdash;they set out an excellent table for the parliamentary sittings. I am sure the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) would agree with many of these ideas. This table, which appears on page 42, allocates additional time for 90-second statements on both the Monday and the Tuesday. In 1990, I moved from the Victorian parliament to the federal House. The Victorian parliament did not have the facility for 90-second statements by members. A short, sharp 90-second statement is a good way of getting important issues up and running in the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is surprising how much can be put in a 90-second statement. In many instances, these statements are the catalyst for further debate. I have heard 90-second statements in the House which have aroused the curiosity of ministers and other honourable members, who have followed up the particular issue, which has resulted in a major debate later. I welcome the timetable set out by my colleagues for 90-second statements on both the Monday and the Tuesday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find only one fault with that timetable, namely, the finishing time on a Thursday. A finishing time of 4 p.m. on a Thursday would be more suitable for those honourable members from Western Australia, Far North Queensland and other distant areas. I suggest an earlier finishing time because it would enable honourable members from distant electorates to spend the Friday, Saturday and Sunday in their electorates, to have the opportunity to tell their constituents what has been happening in the federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One facet of parliamentary life is representing one's constituents and another is being accountable by telling one's constituents what has been happening, why it happened, the results and what will happen in the succeeding weeks following the debates that have occurred. I do not see any major problem with taking the four hours off the Thursday sitting and adding it to Tuesday and Wednesday. I do not see as too objectionable the House rising at 10 p.m. on the Tuesday and Wednesday. It would mean that the House would have the adjournment debate at 9.30 p.m. and rise at 10 p.m. on the Tuesday and Wednesday of each week. It would not be a late night. It would benefit those honourable members who represent large rural electorates in Western Australia. Those honourable members must be under great pressure in visiting constituents in their distant electorates. </PARA>

I happened to be in the chamber when a prominent opposition member was reading his speech and referred to government members laughing. I quickly spun around to find out who was laughing and realised that he was referring to me. Then the penny dropped that the comment had been written into the speech. So much for spontaneity. So much for instant humour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spare a thought for the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), who had the arduous task of chairing the deliberations and delivering the final report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time: bills, questions and working hours</EMPHASIS>. He is stoically sitting through the proceedings as we further debate what I think is an excellent report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the criticisms of the report may very well be that the report does not go far enough and that it could have encompassed further changes. However, the committee was very conscious of the fact that previous procedure committee reports have been totally ignored; therefore, it was the view of the chairman and of the committee that we ought to take a limited number of subjects that we were fairly confident of getting through&mdash;hence the restriction on the issues raised by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I confess that when I first came to this place a neighbour of mine, the then honourable member for Prospect, Dick Klugman, was a member of my faction in the parliament. I quickly learned that, no matter how much I might have agreed with Dick's contribution during a faction meeting, it never really did me much good, visibly or publicly, to say it. More is the pity, I think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I now find myself in a similar position with the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) who has written to members of the committee saying that the report is a good one and that we should not leave it to the executives of either party but should have a joint debate&mdash;not in this place but outside it, because we have much to gain. Unfortunately, I find myself totally agreeing with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is rather sad that it will not be the members of the parliament on either side who really make the decision, it is more likely to be the leaders of the respective parties. The agreements they reach about these propositions will be the deciding factor. That is all to be regretted. I would have hoped that there were some decisions about proceedings of parliament that members of parliament themselves perhaps could take without the benefit of guidance from above. But I see that that will not be the case. However, to be fair, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his response to the report has indicated that there is much about it that attracts him and that he would like to add some things in, which is very good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure many members of the public would be quite shocked to learn that question time, although it regularly occurs in this place, is not guaranteed in our standing orders. As we are witnessing today, the executive from time to time can decline to have a question time. I am one of those people who feel that we ought to have a question time every time the parliament sits. More importantly, I think one of the biggest contributions the procedure committee has made is to try to entrench question time into standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many complaints about question time. Anyone who witnesses question time will see what a robust affair it is, with many points of order about longwinded responses and the relevance of some of those responses. Those on the government side could also raise the issue of longwinded questions. But be that as it may, the committee is trying to tackle some of those issues in a sensible way. It felt the best way of ensuring that answers to questions are kept to a minimum and that matters are relevant is by specifying some minimums; that is, question time should at least go for three-quarters of an hour and that there should be at least 16 questions. I hope we will have an opportunity to see that in the next session of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When framing these recommendations we always have to have a mind's eye on balance and a bit of give and take. I certainly see no harm in extending question time even further. Maybe that would be a bait for the other important innovation about question time: the rostering of ministers. I regret that the opposition rather defensively or alternatively tries to suggest it is a way for executive members of the government, particularly the Prime Minister, to get away from question time. When I first thought about rostering quite some time ago that was my response. But the more I think about it, the more I am convinced it really will give an opportunity to put accountability into the ministerial frontbench. The opportunity to ask question after question of a minister or a group of ministers will only add to accountability. It is quite right for opposition members to get up and say that question time is an important aspect of the government's accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Bonython demonstrated in his speech, when we analyse the number of questions asked by the leadership groups in the opposition of the leadership groups in the government, we find that they absolutely overwhelm and dominate question time. Rostering will break out of that. Whilst we have opted for a limited form of rostering, I certainly hope that, with experience, we will see a much more widespread form of rostering introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bendigo also mentioned questions on notice. I have always been a bit disappointed about the amount of time that it takes to get a ministerial reply to a question on notice. The committee again recommends 90 days. The important thing here is that a previous procedure committee nominated that figure. I think that is overly generous in terms of the length of time required to respond. I would certainly like to see a much shorter response time, and I hope in subsequent considerations on this aspect the House might agree to a much shorter response time for questions on notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to talk about estimates. One of the most important changes in this House was the move to a robust committee system. We have to acknowledge the work that the Senate has done in setting up its committee system, and in particular the estimates. The procedure committee has indicated in its report that it would be interested in looking at an estimates procedure and, in particular, combining with the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are members on both sides of the House who wish to affirm the importance of the committee system to this House, then we will have to make some changes. I do not think we in the House of Representatives can argue that we have anywhere near the opportunity to scrutinise the budget that is being brought down. With any power or responsibility people can fail to exercise it; people can trivialise it. So be it. But the point is that we in this House do not have that opportunity. I think it would be a good thing if we were able to combine with the Senate and have joint estimates committees. The Senate may well object to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if we want to reform the committee system, we cannot argue that members and senators cannot work together in committees. We already work together on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Public Works. We certainly work together in the committee I am pleased to chair&mdash;the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. So there is the precedent&mdash;and I think we ought to work very hard at this reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of members of the opposition have suggested that one way of fixing the procedures of this House is to reduce the amount of legislation. That would be a terrific idea. But honourable members opposite have to understand that the volume of legislation is a reflection of the position of the Senate. It seeks to minimise delegated legislation as much as possible&mdash;in other words, minimise the amount of rules and regulation we have in place of legislation. Whilst the Senate takes this particular point of view there will always be a large volume of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The innovative idea of a second chamber really shows that this House is up with the times. Some might say it shows a bit of productivity improvement. It is not enterprise bargaining because we are yet to get a dollar increase for it&mdash;and none is suggested. A second chamber would improve throughput without sacrificing anything. In fact, in addition to providing a second chamber, we now also provide the opportunity of referring certain bills to committees. It will be interesting to see what impact that has on the committee structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly welcome the recommendation, but we cannot put off for too long a much closer look at the number of committees we have, to see whether we can amalgamate them with Senate ones and whether we can reduce the number of members serving on them. Giving committees additional workloads&mdash;the last additional workload committees were given was receiving annual reports of departments and agencies&mdash;has proved to be a very useful tool. But, in referring legislation, ministers will want it to be dealt with effectively and promptly by committees&mdash;so the acid will be on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am rather thrilled at having a second opportunity to urge the House to strongly support a change in procedures. We have to take ourselves very seriously if we want members of the public to take us seriously. A failure to address the issues raised in this report on procedure can only lower the esteem that people have of this place. I find it disappointing that the powers of members of parliament are quietly being eroded. I have already introduced a bill to exclude members of parliament from the impact of the Privacy Act so they are able to perform their role as members of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that in taxation legislation the ability of members of parliament to seek information about their constituents and the problems they may be having has been severely curtailed by secrecy provisions. In fact, the ombudsman&mdash;both in taxation and other matters&mdash;is in an infinitely superior position to ordinary back bench members of parliament who have, I believe, the onerous responsibility of representing their constituents, no matter what. They do not seek a price, and nor should they. They represent without fear or favour. I strongly believe that our powers should not be curtailed.

Perhaps I expected too much of a committee that was given a job that was, in my view, a particularly important one. I am prepared to accept that as criticism of the comments I make.

Yet it has dealt with a number of issues and made some useful suggestions. Nevertheless, it has dealt with a number of important matters rather superficially. In many respects, it has merely treated symptoms of a problem that obviously exist&mdash;everyone has agreed with that&mdash;rather than actually getting down to what causes those problems or facing up to fundamentals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's recommendations will do little to allay my concerns that&mdash;in many respects and most unfortunately&mdash;the House of Representatives has become something of a farce. At least we should say&mdash;I could say, anyway&mdash;that the Senate, as it is presently constituted, is slightly more relevant. The fact is that nothing is actually decided in this place. Worse still, nothing is ever really debated here&mdash;except what I have observed on this occasion. People come and go, and make speeches. They do not even take part in debates. In many cases, speakers from both sides do not listen to what the speaker from the other side has said. So much for debating; unfortunately, that does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people are disappointed when they visit this parliament. The few people who are in the gallery watching the deliberations of the House of Representatives of this country might well be disappointed to find hardly anybody here. School groups quite often come through and they are, for obvious reasons, disappointed. They wonder what members are doing. I heard the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) quite rightly explain that we are doing other things. But my concern is that we have so many other things to do while parliament is sitting. So our attention is not concentrated on what is happening here in this place. We are off attending committee meetings and doing all sorts of other things at the same time. I wonder what people think when they come here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the processes in this place very often are quite irrelevant. Honourable members realise that, I suspect. They do not have to be here too long to realise that what we say in this place does not really make an iota of difference to the end result. Perhaps that is why they stay out of the chamber and do not bother to participate. I wonder whether the people of Australia realise how irrelevant in many respects what happens in this place is. In practice, the government of the day makes the laws. The opposition's role is limited to a bit of behind the scenes pleading and cajoling but, by the time legislation gets into this parliament for debate&mdash;whatever that is&mdash;it is really all over bar the shouting. That has been of great concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have come to realise how important the opposition is to the overall scheme of things. I have come to realise, having been a member of the opposition for almost four years, that the opposition in respect of the workings of our democracy is as important&mdash;maybe in some respects it is even more important&mdash;as the government. Opposition members have a vital role to play. It is very important that we be allowed to play that role completely and fully. It is in the interests of democracy that that should occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the talk in this report about establishing second chambers, main committees and so on will not actually change what the House of Representatives is all about.

But the things that need to be addressed by such a committee ought to be perfectly obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have alluded to the rights and position of the opposition. I believe the rights of the opposition have to be safeguarded absolutely. I do not know how we go about doing that, but I am quite sure that governments of either political persuasion cannot be trusted with the responsibility of allowing oppositions to work. In my view, convention and tradition&mdash;which we rely on at the moment&mdash;are not enough. In recent times we have seen the government use its numbers&mdash;which it has by virtue of being the government&mdash;simply to prevent the opposition from operating effectively. We have endured that over the last few months. I think something needs to be done to ensure that the government of the day cannot prevent the opposition from carrying out its functions to the fullest extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned about the extent to which we deal with matters purely along party lines in this place. I think that practice should be broken down. It often creates a situation where people are mindlessly disinterested in what is actually occurring in the parliament most of the time. We are all guilty of this. How often do honourable members come in here to vote in a division and the first question they need to ask the person sitting next to them is, `What are we voting on'? We come in here and sit with our party&mdash;we sit on the same side as our colleagues&mdash;without being aware of what we are casting our votes on. When we do that, I wonder whether we are really representing the best interests of our constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, party affiliations are important; they will always be important. Allegiances will always be important. But, ultimately, we are here to represent our electorates and our constituents. If we are not following what is happening in this place and making intelligent decisions about casting our votes, I do not believe we are doing our jobs properly. Yet the present system encourages us to take that mindless approach to the proceedings here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private members business is covered in the report. This has to be a joke. As kindly as one may view this government's practice of devoting time to private members business, there is no doubt in my mind that, whilst this provides a genuine opportunity for members to raise matters of concern to them and their electorates, the truth is that we know&mdash;but I do not know whether the people of Australia do&mdash;that nothing ever happens. We can come in here and support, often on a bipartisan basis, an important motion. We can debate a matter which is important and, in the end, the time expires and no decisions are taken. That may be one way of getting things off our chests or getting up and making speeches about something important, but often things are introduced, debated and never decided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many such issues, but one comes to mind particularly. The previous member for Macquarie moved a motion dealing with the funding of abortions through Medicare. Without canvassing that issue, it was apparent that there was a considerable amount of bipartisan support for that motion which would have prevented such funding. I do not know whether the parliament would have voted for or against that motion in the end, but the point was that the government of the day obstructed and prevented any efforts to have a vote taken on that motion. That sort of occurrence is quite common. Ultimately, it makes a joke of private members business, which is controlled by party and government considerations. Governments of either persuasion have not, and will not, allow voting on private members bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been said about question time. The report deals only superficially with the symptoms; its puts bandaids on the problems. It talks about rostering and all sorts of other issues. Whilst they may be part of a solution to the problem, that is not the real issue. The point is that the Speaker must be in control of question time, and there is a very clear case for some sort of independent Speaker. I would not want to cast aspersions on you or your colleagues, Mr Deputy Speaker, or indeed on the Speaker, but the point is that when the Speaker is from the government party, even with the best of intentions, no-one would even pretend that he could do his job entirely adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we cannot have some sort of independent Speaker, the clerk might be best placed of all to sit in that chair. But it should be somebody who could actually chair the proceedings and make sure that questions were asked and answered in accordance with the standing orders. They never are now. We have talked about this matter. The standing orders say that questions should be relevant. That is not a difficult requirement to meet. If one looks up the dictionary, one will find that the meaning of `relevant' is quite specific. Yet, day after day, that standing order is not complied with. We need to have someone in the chair who will require answers to be in accordance with the standing orders. That must occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dorothy dixers should clearly not be allowed. In some respects, government members probably should not be able to ask questions at all, unless they are serious and genuine about asking about matters which are of concern to them or their electorates. That must have been the original intention of question time. Yet, day after day, we see government members standing up here and asking dorothy dixers which give ministers the opportunity to make statements&mdash;which they ought to do at some other time&mdash;or simply criticise the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the dumbest dorothy dixers are the ones which begin `Has the Minister heard about a report in the newspaper about the Leader of the Opposition saying such and such'. The whole process is fundamentally flawed. I would have thought those sorts of issues could have been addressed in the report. Ministers should make statements. They are enabled to do so by the standing orders. That is what they ought to do rather than use question time to make statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the roles were reversed, this same criticism would apply to the opposition. It has been said that the opposition spends too much time devising tactics simply to score political points at question time or entrap ministers, rather than giving members on either side the opportunity to ask questions about matters which concern them or their constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The behaviour of members during question time is deplorable. I think children should not be allowed in the parliament during question time, let alone be encouraged to come to see question time. They go away with a terrible impression of what goes on in this place. I do not have time to go into the reasons for this behaviour&mdash;other members have alluded to them&mdash;but the fact is that members of this place behave very badly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of talk about sitting hours. Once again, the committee has done a bit of work on that subject. But, in the end, it has not addressed some of the real issues. Something has to be achieved by the parliament. If this place is to be merely a rubber stamp for the government we might as well come here and get the job done as quickly as possible. I am quite happy to sit here for 24 hours a day. If we do not achieve anything, we might as well go about the process of government in the completely perfunctory way in which we go about it now. Why pretend, by changing all the sitting hours around, that we actually do something here when the present system militates against that completely?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see any particular merit in finishing early. Unless it counts, we might as well get it over with and get home to our families. I personally do not worry too much about being tired; it is a feature of this job, as it is of other jobs. If one has been in the services, the police force or whatever, it is not too much of a problem. In any case, the facilities in Parliament House are excellent for those members who want to look after themselves and stay fit. I ask the committee: what do we do if we finish here at 8.00 or 6.30 p.m.? Are we to go out and socialise? Most of us will continue working anyway. I am in favour of getting on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a lot of other comments, but I am going to run out of time. I do not think meetings and committee hearings should be going on while the parliament is sitting. I think once again that underlines the fact that members of parliament are not really concerned about what is happening in the parliament and are not concerned about taking part or being informed about the matters that they are voting on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report accepts all the existing antiquated concepts and practices. It talks about bills being read three times.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to be making a contribution to this debate on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure. Although I am a new member in this place, I have been involved with politics for some 30 years. I share with previous speakers alarm at the low esteem in which political life is held in Australia. It is little wonder that the casual observer of Australian television is appalled by the way in which parliament is reported. In turn, and without blaming the media, it is a fair reflection of what goes on in this House, especially at question time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago, on a committee inquiry in the south-western and western suburbs of Sydney, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) and I met a group of students and had lunch with them. When those students discovered that we were from the Liberal Party, the Labor Party and the National Party respectively, one of them asked, `But don't you fight each other all the time?'. I was saddened by that. It touched me very deeply to think that this young person, who was in a special school because of his tendency towards violence, saw in the politicians of Australia a role model for violence. It was also particularly ironic because we were attending there as part of our inquiry into violence in schools. Here we were assessing these young people and reporting back to the House on ways of removing violence from schools, when we, the inquirers, were seen to be models of violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) for his work on the committee and in the preparation of the report. One of the report's key areas is question time. While I would like to see question time brushed up and polished a little, I would not like to see it gutted. As the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) suggested, it should not be held so late in the afternoon that it becomes irrelevant to the evening news media. If we are to have a lively, no-holds-barred&mdash;albeit more decorous&mdash;question time, it should not be held at such a time that no-one will be interested in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to see the introduction of a time limit at question time because that might justify having supplementary questions. I suggest a time limit of four minutes for answers to definitive questions, with perhaps two minutes for answers to supplementary questions. That would change the practice of the opposition leadership always questioning the government leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another approach&mdash;I hope the honourable member for Bonython will take this on board&mdash;is for question time to be held in two parts. I think it was the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) who suggested that question time could be a little longer. If it were of an hour's length, the first half hour could be devoted to the leadership asking and answering questions on national issues, while the second half hour could be devoted to ordinary members' questions on matters of relevance to their electorates and areas of expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember listening to the proceedings of parliament in the days of Menzies, McEwen and Whitlam when those sorts of questions were asked. They were answered honestly and intelligently. There was also an overriding proviso that, if a question were vague or esoteric, the minister had the right to place the question on notice. That is fair enough. If an honourable member asked a question about some remote corner of his or her electorate, of which a minister had little or no knowledge, he or she would have to expect that question to be put on notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that many backbenchers on both sides of the House would regard being able to ask those sorts of questions preferable to the present situation where coalition members are deprived of the right to ask questions or else have questions framed for them, while government backbenchers have to dish up dorothy dixers. Dividing question time into two half hours to deal with different types of questions gives the leadership a fair run and allows backbenchers on both sides of the House to ask questions on matters of relevance to their electorates and areas of expertise. That might lead to more rational debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As regards committees, I would like to see House of Representatives committees with some of the powers of Senate committees to examine legislation and to examine not just those matters that arise from reports and annual reports but more broadly based matters&mdash;matters, say, of policy development, policy accountability and functional accountability. I have not been associated with the House long enough to be able to suggest a mechanism for that but, broadly speaking, I would like to see the committees of the House made more relevant to particular portfolios&mdash;some of them already are but many of them are not&mdash;and with wider investigative powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) touched on the subject of members business in his contribution to this debate last week. I doubt that a 90-second statement is long enough for a good point to be properly developed. Towards the end of those statements, everyone is rushing like a Bondi tram to finish, rather than concentrating on making a sensible and meaningful point. My recommendation to the House&mdash;again, I hope the honourable member for Bonython will take this on board&mdash;would be for the time to be increased to 2 1/2 minutes. One could develop a point and make some impact in 2 1/2 minutes, whereas 90 seconds is just too short. In the 15 minutes available, it would be better to have six speeches, each of 2 1/2 minutes duration, than bashing through 90-second statements which end up sounding more like gobbledegook than measured consideration of particular issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other speakers have raised the issue of relevance in relation to question time, but relevance also impacts on other areas of business. It appears to me that standing orders 145 and 321 have lost some of their relevance. When I first came to this place eight or nine months ago, ministers were tabling documents on request. Nowadays, documents are seldom tabled because everyone appears to be hiding behind <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> page 559, where it provides that a minister can claim immunity on the basis of the privacy or confidentiality of a document. At times that is clearly nonsensical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I remember rightly, on one occasion in the sports rorts affair there was a letter to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) from the Benalla Shire Council that the minister would not table. Even under the Queensland local government act&mdash;I imagine it would be the same in Victoria&mdash;that document would be freely available to any ratepayer in Benalla who wanted to look at it. After all, it was a letter from one instrument of government, local government, to another instrument of government, federal government. How could it possibly be either private or confidential? We need to look at the relevance of questions, the claiming of privilege with documents that arise in questions and, in particular, whether we could have a better format than that currently existing in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> on page 559. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of the sitting hours, I would like to put forward a proposition that falls between the recommendation of the committee of the honourable member for Bonython and what we are doing at present. Although I share broadly the view of those honourable members who have suggested that we should not be driving people's health into the ground by sitting until 11, 12, 1, 2, and 3 o'clock in the morning or sitting on a regular basis until 11 p.m., I suggest that there are dangers in sitting to 8 o'clock three nights a week and 6.30 on the fourth night. I think honourable members will find that after 8 o'clock on the first three nights one of two things will happen. I am not reflecting on my fellow members, but I think there will be a tendency for fairly long dinner parties that go on into the evening, which will be no more healthy than the present practice of getting up at 11 o'clock. On the other hand, we will end up having endless committee meetings, caucus meetings, joint party meetings and the like. We will possibly find that, far from getting home at 8 o'clock, we will end up still sitting until 10.30 or 11 o'clock doing some form of parliamentary business, probably committee and caucus work. I suggest that will not evoke any great improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finishing at 6.30 on Thursday night will mean that some members will certainly be able to get home. I suppose that will mean that there will be this great rush from 5.30 onwards for people to get away early&mdash;there will be unofficial deals with the whips and so on&mdash;and for the proceedings on Thursday to start to peter out from about 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Those members who go to conferences around Australia find that, on the last day of a conference, especially one that finishes at midday, nothing much happens after morning tea on the last day of the conference. I suspect that that is what could happen on Thursday evenings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My suggestion is that we have two early nights and two late nights. When many of us have come from fairly remote areas of Australia and we have made the effort to get to Canberra, we are not going to be unduly stressed by sitting until, say, 10 o'clock on the first two nights. I am pleased that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is here because he might share a view on this. I suggest to the Leader of the House and the honourable member for Bonython that on the Mondays and Tuesdays the House rise at 6 p.m. for a dinner break, sit again at 7.30 until 9.30&mdash;that is, have two hours of good debate&mdash;and have the adjournment debate at 9.30 with members going home at 10 o'clock. It is not an excessively late night, but it would allow members time in the evening to give some consideration to their duties here in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the concept that on the Wednesday and Thursday nights the House could rise early. I would like to see the Thursday night go on until 8 o'clock, but I suppose 6.30 is fair enough if people from South Australia and Western Australia have to get away. I think that my suggestion would also have another effect. It would be a great pity if there were never a time when members could meet over dinner during a session. Other than when we do our committee work, there is very little opportunity for any camaraderie between the government and the opposition. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
