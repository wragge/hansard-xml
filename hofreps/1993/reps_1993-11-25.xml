Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday, 23 November, in accordance with the procedures, a nationwide live telecast of the chamber was proceeding. After question time the telecast was to proceed until 3 o'clock, which is the arrangement that now applies, and at your call the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) moved a special motion. He was halfway through his speech when the telecast was interrupted by the announcer who controls those programs, who said, `We have a problem if we allow the telecast to continue until 3 o'clock. Because of the particularity of this motion there will be the rest of the speech by the member for Higgins followed by the member for Ballarat's speech. Then the telecast will cut out and we will not have the balancing item of a government minister's response. Therefore, we propose to end the telecast at this moment'. So, in mid-sentence, the speech of the poor young honourable member for Higgins was chopped off the nationwide telecast. However, this is in slight contrast to the guidelines, which are such that although now question time often goes only the exact 45 minutes the ABC has indicated that it will in fact allow the coverage to proceed for the full one hour. That is important on days when we have condolence motions, because quite often a condolence motion covers the first 20 minutes and question time then follows.</PARA></TALK.START>

I point out that in fact, in terms of balance, perhaps the ABC got it wrong. Ministers have 30 or 40 minutes of question time&mdash;naturally, as they are answering the questions&mdash;and time is virtually unlimited for them, whereas the coalition has much less time during question time. Therefore, the real balance over the course of an hour was not necessarily achieved by the action taken by the controller of that live broadcast to the nation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in undertaking that inquiry with the reference from the Senate, the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities found that there was nothing which it could pursue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The progress report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The role of audit committees in corporate governance</EMPHASIS> is part of an ongoing matter for the committee. Many honourable members will be more than interested in the way that our major public companies are audited and the accuracy of those audits. It is pleasing to note that a large number of our major listed companies are now setting up internal audit committees. The committee is very pleased with that change of attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally&mdash;and I know my colleague the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) will expand on this&mdash;the committee visited New Zealand shortly after the new parliament met.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were looking at the way New Zealand undertakes its corporate regulation and control. It was a very interesting visit and I think all members of the committee came back with a much deeper understanding of New Zealand, its role in corporate governance and the way its securities industry is going. I came back even more firmly convinced that the so-called fuzzy law area of company law did not exactly turn me on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that some countries in the world, including New Zealand, are taking the view that industry should be allowed to regulate itself more and government should tend to move away from that area.

That is a matter which I suspect we will debate down the track in this parliament with the Attorney-General's review of company law and corporate law in Australia. I commend these three reports to the House. They make good reading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland). I would like to add to his comments on these three reports from the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The role of audit committees in corporate governance: a progress report</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trading of shares in Jupiter's Ltd</EMPHASIS>, and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Committee exchange with the New Zealand Parliament</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the remarks made by the honourable member for McEwen in respect of audit committees are worth noting. I commend to persons interested in this the addendum to that particular report of the committee. That addendum was prepared by Arthur Andersen. I am disappointed that there are still a number of public corporations which do not have audit committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the excesses of the 1980s and the problems with entrepreneurs, it seems to me that audit committees are a very good form of protection, not only for the companies and the shareholders, but also for customers, the public at large and certainly for the directors. I commend that practice which, although it does now extend to an increasing number of major companies, has still not been universally adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say nothing on the report on Jupiter's Ltd trading of shares, but want to make a few remarks about the exchange with New Zealand. There are three aspects of that. First, although the honourable member for McEwen has said that he does not take to fuzzy law with respect to corporations, my attitude is directly the reverse. The background of the committee's discussions with New Zealand was quite intriguing. It was pointed out that, whereas we have been priding ourselves on the introduction of the new Corporations Law here, in fact New Zealand has gone way beyond the concepts that we have pursued. It has looked at the Canadian precedent. We have spent years trying to resolve within our federal system the commonality of our Corporations Law. There is much to be said, I think, for our now looking to what New Zealand has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see that legislation is going to be introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan), later this day, regarding evidence and procedure in the New Zealand bill. There are observations in our report with respect to the increased commonality of our taxation law. We would now do well to turn to our Corporations Law and try to advance to the point New Zealand has already reached. The law New Zealand has adopted is significantly ahead of the one in Australia in a range of areas including, as I see it, the application of fuzzy law rather than black-letter law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the comments of the honourable member for McEwen&mdash;and he did say that the debate would ensue&mdash;it is interesting that a justice of the New Zealand court with whom we discussed the issue said that, in his view, as indeed in the views of members of the New Zealand round table and others, there is little doubt that the courts will interpret fuzzy law with the same measure of responsibility on the members of the board of a company and the executive of a company as they would black-letter law. Indeed, they suggested that, to a greater degree, responsibility and commonsense would be achieved by the fuzzy law rather than our legislation. So I believe that there is much to be gleaned from that New Zealand precedent and that it is now  time for us to follow it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other issues I briefly wish to address. Firstly, out of this committee there has been a further recommendation made to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) with respect to what are now known as super shares and matters now before the Australian Stock Exchange. I would like to commend the Attorney-General on the correspondence he has entered into with the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange. I do not believe that introducing changes to the ASX listing requirements with respect to super shares on a subjective one case only basis is appropriate. I believe there does need to be appropriate time within which those matters can be considered, and I commend the Attorney-General for that correspondence and trust that the members of the Australian Stock Exchange will agree that there should be a reasonable extension of time before any new listing requirements are gazetted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter that I wanted to raise was that I note that there has been a very public debate between the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister of Malaysia with respect to a number of matters which are outside this particular field. One of the concerns I have had is that there is a field for us to apply in our region the same relationship we have in the CER. Within APEC, one of the difficulties and one of the barbs of Prime Minister Mahathir's argument is that APEC now is far more embracive than originally intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is reason for us in our region to look not just at New Zealand but to look at Papua New Guinea and to look at the ASEAN countries and to try to establish some commonality in Corporations Law, in tax law and particularly in the normal practices of commercial law. I would trust that, in looking at where APEC is now headed, we do not forget that there are enormous advantages in conducting with countries in our region, particularly the ASEAN countries and PNG, negotiations that lead to the sorts of relationships that we have with New Zealand in respect of corporate law. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6T4">Mr ELLIOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the final report of the committee's inquiry into fraud on the Commonwealth. I am pleased to be able to indicate that the committee's report is a unanimous one and, given that you are in the chair, Mr Speaker, let me say that it continues the fine traditions of the committee's inquiry work. The inquiry was initially referred to the committee in March 1992 and referred again on 26 May this year by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). In association with the general reference on fraud, the committee also had referred to it four audit reports related to fraud issues. The report addresses all the terms of reference of the inquiry. These are very wide ranging, covering such diverse matters as risk assessment to whistleblowing. Six years ago, the government changed its fraud management policy in response to the recommendations of the 1987 report on the review of systems for dealing with fraud in the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My committee has essentially looked at the adequacy of that policy and how well it has been working since its introduction. The committee's work is the first major external review of the policy for the Commonwealth as a whole. The committee supports the basic thrust of the policy which gave managers responsibility for dealing with fraud against their programs. This approach, however, has created a more dispersed system for fraud control at the Commonwealth level than in other jurisdictions. This means that more attention must be given to ensure that there is consistent minimum duplication of effort and accountability in the way in which fraud management strategies are implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the committee's general support for the policy, we believe sections of it need to be revised to achieve a clearer definition of the roles of all agencies involved and to provide more guidance on how some strategies are used. As well, there is a need to redirect the policy and to achieve a more appropriate balance between agency independence and a Commonwealth-wide approach and more emphasis must be given to developing a picture of overall performance on fraud at the Commonwealth level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outstanding achievement of the policy to date has been to put forward control on the agenda of managers. The significance of this achievement should not be underestimated. All agencies that are required to do so are meeting their obligations to prepare risk assessments and fraud control plans or statements on an ongoing basis, albeit the quality of the documents prepared is certainly variable. To enhance performance in this area, the committee believes agencies would benefit from assistance from both the Attorney-General's Department and the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends the Attorney-General's Department develop and provide agencies with advice and guidelines on the preparation of risk assessments and fraud control plans and the Auditor-General review agency risk assessments and fraud control plans on a two-year cycle. In undertaking these tasks, the emphasis of both agencies is on providing agencies with constructive feedback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The focus for the 1990s is to ensure that fraud control plans are actually implemented. The committee is looking for improved performance in this area. To facilitate this, it supports the improved accountability arrangements for fraud control proposed for the new audit legislation, whereby it would be a statutory requirement to prepare and implement plans and heads of agencies would be held accountable for the efficiency, effectiveness and ethics of their agency. Internal audit and the Auditor-General also have crucial roles in evaluating the effectiveness of the strategies introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most contentious issues which the inquiry addresses is the impact of the policy change which gave all agencies responsibility for investigating routine instances of fraud, thereby drawing them into the law enforcement process. The Australian Federal Police have been required to focus their resources on the more complex or larger scale frauds. There was some mutual suspicion between internal investigation units, which want to get into the really interesting fraud work, and the Australian Federal Police, which want a much greater role and involvement in internal agency fraud investigations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make the policy work more effectively, as well as efficiently, the committee recommends the role statements on investigation work of both the Australian Federal Police and agencies be strengthened. Standard criteria for the referral of fraud cases to the Australian Federal Police for investigation are recommended. These include, as a general rule, Crimes Act investigations being carried out by the Australian Federal Police, with the exception of investigations by those agencies which can satisfy both the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions that they have the capacity and capability to undertake criminal investigations. A benchmark figure for fraud above which the matter should be referred to the Australian Federal Police for a decision on whether to investigate is also recommended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also recommends that the Australian Federal Police have an enhanced role in trading and coordinating fraud investigation work. Under the new policy arrangements, there is a need for the Australian Federal Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Government Solicitor to accept that agencies have an ongoing responsibility for the cases of fraud which agencies refer to them. Accordingly, the level of client services offered by those agencies is an important issue. While the Director of Public Prosecutions has done well in this area, there is considerable room for improvement on the part of the Australian Federal Police. Improved service standards are recommended for the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greater emphasis has been placed on the use of administrative remedies for dealing with offenders who commit minor frauds. The major problem is that disciplinary measures are not always implemented effectively. To redress this, the committee recommends that the Public Service Commission give a high priority to training managers in the understanding and formal use of the measures under the Public Service Act. An unwanted consequence of relying more on administrative remedies is that some serious cases of fraud are being dealt with inappropriately by using administrative remedies rather than prosecution. Heads of agencies must ensure that this does not happen in their agencies. If managers take up the offer of the Director of Public Prosecutions to provide advice in an early stage in cases, this would certainly help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new arrangements, substantial emphasis is placed on enhancing ethical behaviour in organisations. It is self-evident that this is directly affected by the attitude and behaviour of management. While developing codes of conduct, guidelines for companies doing business with the Commonwealth and post-separation guidelines are important, the critical issue is that staff are aware of them, understand their importance and conduct themselves accordingly. The committee stresses the Public Service Commission's important role in training in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that the range of skills required to deal with fraud control is diverse. It encompasses audit, legal, investigative and administrative expertise. The committee strongly supports the use of multi-disciplinary teams in undertaking fraud investigation and control tasks where possible. Unfortunately, the adequacy of the new policy arrangements is difficult to assess since basic information on the extent and nature of fraud is frequently not available at agency level, let alone at the Commonwealth level. Accordingly, the committee recommends enhanced data collection and analysis systems for both policy and program evaluation and criminal intelligence purposes. Information technology would also facilitate this occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another key aspect of the inquiry relates to whistleblowing. Whistleblowing on serious fraud and maladministration is a necessary activity in the public sector. Support for whistleblower legislation was much greater than anticipated. With the basic theoretical work already completed by Finn and the Gibbs committee, a three-tiered approach to whistleblower reporting and protection is recommended in our report. It is recommended that all agencies nominate an appropriate high-level officer to receive complaints from whistleblowers. As well, it is recommended that the Ombudsman be the independent reporting and protection agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation is not the panacea for dealing with whistleblower complaints and protection. Changes in community attitudes to whistleblowing and whistleblowers are also needed. I believe the committee's recommendations on whistleblowing are comprehensive, groundbreaking and particularly significant reform recommendations for public administration. The committee does not support the Department of Finance proposal for a formal reward system for informants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee is supportive of the critical role which advanced information technology can and does play in combating fraud, it remains concerned about a number of facets of the law enforcement access network, LEAN, project. The committee reiterates the need to put this project on a sound legislative footing as a matter of priority. In this dispersed fraud management system, coordination is essential if it is to work efficiently and effectively. While the committee recommends that the Attorney-General's Department retain responsibility for this task, it believes that this decision should be reviewed in the light of the recommendations of the Steering Committee on Commonwealth Law Enforcement Arrangements for a new law enforcement agency which could take over this role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the scope for improvement which the committee found in the Commonwealth's approach to fraud assessment prevention and control, when the Commonwealth's achievements are compared to those of other agencies, generally I think we can feel that those achievements have been quite substantial. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The further recommendations of the committee's work go to the very nub of ensuring the fundamental philosophy that some in the committee characterised as wanting to ensure that we have fences at the top of the cliff rather than ambulances at the bottom&mdash;effectively a system of prevention rather than cure relating to fraud control. I think that is a particularly important focus as to the way we would like to see fraud control management be undertaken into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations relating to whistleblowing are particularly significant. We propose that there be a three-tiered process relating to whistleblowing. Fundamentally, in cases where people have used&mdash;or have lacked the confidence to use&mdash;established reporting mechanisms when they do go public, they will be entitled to protection from disciplinary procedures if they reasonably believe the allegation was accurate, notwithstanding their failure to avail themselves of alternative procedures, if the course was taken in excusable circumstances. Such a reporter should not be given any special protection regarding defamation or other laws; but rather there would be protection through the system, using the ombudsman arrangement, as we outline in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the recommendations, when studied in detail, do achieve objectives that many in the community have felt have been particularly significant in many areas of the public sector across this nation. Certainly, there are examples at the state level where if those sorts of protections had applied in the past we would have had more effective and open public administration, with the right sort of public confidence maintained in the integrity of people and in their reporting arrangements. Clearly, the confidence that people have, because of the establishment of ethical behaviour throughout agencies, is crucial. The report goes to great lengths to talk about those issues and to provide the focus that fraud control should have in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to thank the members of the subcommittee and the committee at large for their work. In particular, I thank the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) for their work in this parliament as members of the subcommittee. I also thank the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), who was a member of the subcommittee for part of the time.

I also wish to pay tribute, as the chairman did, to the original and continuing members and to the staff&mdash;particularly Bev Forbes&mdash;who performed their work so magnificently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fraud is an important issue. None of us likes to be ripped off, as taxpayers or as individuals. To ensure that this does not happen, it is critical that the Commonwealth have in place an effective and efficient policy to deal with fraud and that the policy be effectively implemented. As the chairman has told the House, the committee supports the basic thrust of the policy. We support the emphasis on assessment and prevention as well as the decision to give managers more responsibility for dealing with fraud perpetrated on their organisations. However, the results of the committee's work have revealed some shortcomings in the way in which this policy is being implemented. I would like to address just two of the more significant problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, we are concerned that the Commonwealth's fraud control policy has been introduced without a clear picture of the nature and extent of the fraud problem that confronts the Commonwealth. Without this basic information it is difficult to assess the adequacy of the approach adopted. Unfortunately, to date, few strategies have been put in place to address this information deficiency. This is true at both a policy and a strategy level. Furthermore, the data which is available is mainly at an agency level and is not easily collated at a Commonwealth level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To redress this deficiency the committee has recommended that all agencies improve their data collection and reporting activities. This includes all agencies which are not already doing so advising the Australian Federal Police of action taken on all fraud matters identified by an agency but not referred to the Australian Federal Police. It has also been recommended that the Australian Federal Police be responsible for collating this information to maintain a national criminal intelligence capability. Further, it has been recommended that the fraud control section of the annual reporting guidelines be revised to improve the relevance and consistency of the data reported by all agencies on an annual basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the clear focus of the government's policy on fraud control has been to place the onus of responsibility on the management of agencies and to make fraud control a much wider issue than just law enforcement. This means that there are a large number of agencies involved in the fraud management process. Coordination is essential in this dispersed system to ensure that the full range of fraud management strategies are effectively and consistently implemented to ensure any lessons learnt in one area are passed on to other agencies and to maintain a Commonwealth-wide perspective as well as develop a comprehensive picture of overall performance in fraud control at the Commonwealth level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Responsibility for coordination currently resides with the fraud policy and prevention branch of the Attorney-General's Department. Its focus is policy, setting standards, quality control of fraud control documents and exchange of information. The committee is concerned about the department's performance in the coordination role. It is concerned about the `let the managers manage' approach that the Attorney-General's Department has adopted to the coordination task and the limited resources it devotes to coordination. It is concerned also about the overshadowing of this work by the department's focus on the development of the LEAN system, and it is concerned about the time it has taken the Attorney-General's Department to prepare and distribute basic documents such as guidelines on handling fraud cases and a best practice guide, which are important tools to assist agencies in their handling of fraud cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman has just said, while the committee has recommended that the Attorney-General's Department retain responsibility for this task at present, we believe this decision should be reviewed in the light of any recommendations of the Steering Committee on Commonwealth Law Enforcement Arrangements for a new law enforcement agency which could take over this responsibility. In the interim we are looking for a significant improvement in the performance of the Attorney-General's Department in the coordinating role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to comment on an issue covered by the inquiry which is of particular interest to me, and that is the need for whistleblower protection. I believe whistleblowing in the public interest should be recognised as a necessary and lawful activity. It is a means of identifying and remedying illegal and improper conduct in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whistleblowing can save taxpayers' funds. I believe there is an obligation on the part of the Commonwealth government to provide a measure of protection to those who expose fraud and malpractice. From the committee's work it is clear there is a need for a comprehensive scheme to deal with whistleblowing. This is required both to provide a measure of protection for those who blow the whistle and to make it easier to deal with those who knowingly make false or misleading reports. There is burgeoning literature on the subject with several major studies undertaken at the Commonwealth level. The most notable are the work by the Finn and Gibbs committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reviewing this issue the committee concluded that the three-tier approach, outlined by both the Finn and the Gibbs committees, is the most effective way to proceed regarding reporting of whistleblower complaints. The aim is to have a comprehensive scheme with the emphasis on in-house reporting and if, for whatever reason, the complainant is unwilling to say in-house the facility exists for making serious complaints to an independent external body. There should be a strong emphasis on confidentiality in those first two stages. If these systems work credibly and effectively there should be little or no need to go public. However, we do see this as necessarily being a sequential approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the debate on whistleblowing surrounds the choice of an independent agency for both reporting and providing protection. I believe there are significant advantages in building on existing institutions to deal with this matter rather than creating a completely new structure, and fortunately the committee and I agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the ombudsman's ability to investigate and redirect for investigation a wide range of complaints raised by whistleblowers, the committee has recommended the ombudsman's office as the most appropriate agency to receive whistleblower complaints. I fully support that recommendation. The committee looked at a number of agencies which could perform the protection and counselling role including, in particular, the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of reprisals which whistleblowers may be subjected to are wide ranging and go beyond employment related matters. Accordingly, the ombudsman is the agency best placed to deal with such a variety of situations. The committee has recommended that the ombudsman should also be responsible for the protection scheme and for providing counselling for whistleblowers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also made recommendations that it be both a disciplinary and a criminal offence to harass or discriminate against a whistleblower. It has recommended that there be similar offences for making reports which are known to be false and misleading. Appropriate accountability mechanisms for all agencies involved in the whistleblowers scheme have been recommended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this scheme to be effective, it is vital that agency officials have trust and confidence in the proposed lines of communication. This would be achieved only with time and through use of the scheme. Accordingly, to ensure that the scheme is working efficiently and effectively, the committee has recommended that it should be reviewed after two years of operation. Legislation is not the panacea for dealing with whistleblower complaints and protection. Changes in community and agency attitudes to whistleblowing and whistleblowers are also needed. We are looking for these to occur as well. </PARA>

Before I do that, I would like to thank the secretariat staff, particularly Bev Forbes, the subcommittee secretary. I felt a little disadvantaged coming into this inquiry late; nevertheless I very much appreciated the opportunity afforded to me by the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the previous report presented to the House was from the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. One of my areas of interest is the consistency of treatment of criminal activity. Let me give an example. Does the House really believe that someone who commits a white-collar crime stealing $60 million will get the same sentence as someone who, for example, in my electorate holds up a bank and robs it of $6,000 or who holds up a service station and robs it of $1,000? There is something very wrong with our society when we treat white-collar crime&mdash;and that is what fraud is&mdash;as being somehow a nicer type of crime and somehow less injurious than other forms of crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that one of the areas the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration report picks up is this issue of consistency of treatment of offenders. On page 77 of the report it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no simple solution to trying to achieve consistency. Awareness and acceptance of the objective, however, is the first step. Many of the recommendations made in earlier sections of the report, such as the removal of anomalies in legislation dealing with fraud, improved guidelines on how to handle fraud cases, improved training in the use of disciplinary measures, better definition of the roles of various participants in the fraud and control process and improvements in the standards of service from the AFP and the DPP, will assist in achieving consistency.</PARA>
<PARA>The recommendations about reporting, thereby leaving us a trail so that in the future we can examine or revisit consistency, are going to be most helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the chairman and the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) have commented on public interest. That is the area of whistleblowing that may attract the widest public attention. As a member of the subcommittee and the committee, I am delighted at the strong stand that the committee has taken in its recommendations on whistleblowing. Whistleblowers are nothing more than upright people coming forward and doing their duty. That takes a great deal of courage, and so-called whistleblowers in the past have been poorly served by the system for their acts in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Dawson pointed out, if we have an effective mechanism then potentially the Commonwealth purse can be saved considerable amounts of money. I do not want to go over again the three-tier system recommended or reinforced in the committee's report but I would like to highlight the fact that the committee has taken the issue very seriously by recommending that serious harassment or discrimination against a person who has blown the whistle be made a criminal and disciplinary offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A committee cannot signal its intention in a more serious way about an issue than by making such a recommendation. Importantly, the emphasis of the recommendations is that agencies should develop internal mechanisms that facilitate whistleblowing and allow the agency itself in the first instance to deal with it. We provide, of course, fall-backs. I am particularly pleased that, even where a whistleblower does not avail himself of the avenues that the committee recommends for developing his or her concerns and goes public, we still recommend a measure of protection for that person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Dawson has pointed out, the committee is signalling its very serious concern about this issue of whistleblowing by suggesting that its recommendations should again be reviewed after two years. I think we should be pleased about that recommendation. It signals that the committee's intention would be that if there are any deficiencies, if there needs to be further strengthening of these measures, then we will have the opportunity in two years time to revisit it and again recommend it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that I have only spoken on two very small areas of the report. The chairman and the honourable member for Dawson have spoken in a much more comprehensive way. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before proceeding to the substance of the report and my comments on it, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the work of two people in relation to this report. One is the committee secretary, Robyn Webber, who worked diligently and professionally at all times and was of considerable assistance to the committee. The other is the chairman, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), who also worked very hard as the chairman. He obviously took on the task of chairmanship as a real job and worked very diligently indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was anxious to get this report into the parliament in a reasonable time before the end of the parliamentary session. We were very keen to have a proposal with respect to sitting hours considered by the government before the end of this session, in the hope that we might get proper reform of sitting hours for the autumn session next year. There is virtually unanimous agreement within the parliament, and with those associated with it, that there is need for a reform of sitting hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say I feel a slight sense of deja vu on the issue. Whilst I think it is very important, it nevertheless took me back to a previous incarnation I had in this parliament and 1981 when a very substantial move was made within the parliament to reform the sitting hours. In those days I was in the Senate and I worked then with a group of people, Liberal, Labor and National Party members, who made a very thorough effort to try to reform parliamentary sitting hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was working with the then deputy leader of the Labor Party in the Senate, Senator Don Grimes. We were able to achieve a reform of sitting hours in the Senate. It was unfortunate that the matter became derailed in the House of Representatives and the reform did not flow on into here. I well remember the frustration of members from the House of Representatives back in 1981 at the fact that it had been derailed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Manager of Opposition Business in the House, Mick Young, had much to say about that and, between then and the 1983 election, he had a great deal indeed to say on the subject of parliamentary reform including reform of sitting hours. In the event, when the government was elected in March 1983, we moved to an even worse pattern of sitting hours than we had previously. I had many conversations in 1981 with those who had been involved in this chamber with the attempt at reform, very notably, the former member for Robertson, the Hon. Barry Cohen. Labor members freely said that we got the worst of all possible worlds&mdash;whilst they thought they had complaints under the Fraser government, the situation was much worse all around when Mick Young moved to change our hours in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, there is of course a dissenting report, co-authored by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and me, on the subject of sitting hours and on the subject of the second chamber. Because time is short, I am going to have to be very brief indeed. The contents of the dissenting report outline our concerns. I want to place on the record that, in the discussions that were held by the chairman, the honourable member for Bonython, and me with the leadership group of the opposition on this subject, the proposal that in the event ended up being the committee recommendation was one that was never discussed with that leadership group. It was a proposal that came forward within the committee after those discussions and was not one that was considered in those terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some criticisms of them which are obvious from the dissenting report, but one that I will place on record is that I do not believe that the proposed early adjournment on Thursday is practical as it stands. There are only two capital cities that are served by air flights that would get members home on a Thursday night. No other capital cities are served by air flights out of Canberra after the adjournment time proposed in the committee's report. This would require nearly everybody to leave during the adjournment debate. That would be a nightmare all around&mdash;for whips, for honourable members and for those who are trying to run the House's business. Effectively, either we would not go home on Thursday nights, or the House would have to adjourn somewhat earlier. That is a matter which needs to be considered further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously this is something that both the Leader of the Government (Mr Beazley) and the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Howard) will have to negotiate further. It is important, if we reform the sitting hours, that there be a consensus and that both opposition and government needs be met, otherwise we will get the worst of both worlds, a la 1981. The issues of question time and MPIs are of great concern to the opposition and I do not believe that the government can ignore them. As a postscript, it is quite important that there be some coordination with the Senate in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the second chamber, I have a view that a great deal more consideration needs to be given to all the ins and outs of what that proposal is meant to address. It is meant to address the speaking time available for honourable members. I think this issue needs to be treated properly. If we are going to move to two chambers of the House of Representatives, a lot of thought has to be given to it and a lot of input needs to be made. For example, input needs to be made by people such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> staff. There are all sorts of logistical issues that have to be raised. I think all honourable members ought to have a chance to think about this and make their input. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I am more aware of the details of this issue than most other members because I was a member of the committee. I have taken out some information that I think would reinforce the apprehension that I have in relation to a proposal of a second debating chamber running concurrently with this main House of Representatives chamber. Many members of this parliament who have been around for a while fear that the House of Representatives is rapidly sliding into irrelevance. Indeed, there was an article in one of our newspapers recently by a political journalist saying that he does not even know why the opposition turns up for question time because it is irrelevant and not what it is supposed to be. That is the perception of parliament at the moment. Question time is what most people see as having greatest relevance and, in comparative terms, it probably does. To go to two debating chambers and to have to choose between them, with all the conflicts and possibilities that will arise, would be a very serious move to make indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have liked the committee to have taken some more time to look at potential ways of organising the parliamentary sessions so that, for example, the flow of business might be more even and we do not have fill-in debates at the beginning of a session followed by the horrendous use of the guillotine that we see now, which truncates everyone's rights. I also make the point that one of the bases for proposing that the second chamber would be acceptable is that there is a large number of bills that do not ever attract a division. The proposal is, of course, that the divisions would come back here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record the fact that the extraordinary and wide ranging use by this government of the guillotine means that the opposition does not call divisions when it would otherwise want to. By calling a division, it would be using up, say, 15 minutes of the very limited time allowed under the guillotine for the bills that follow. It is felt that that is not fair. If honourable members are to have any sort of opportunity to contribute to debate under a guillotine, limited though those opportunities be, opposition managers of business are loath to cut into that time by the amount of time that a division takes up. That in itself means that we are not getting the proper opportunity to express our view here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are matters that have arisen before in relation to the truncation of opportunities for honourable members to properly participate here that I would also like to mention. This week, the manager of government business in this place withdrew 155 orders of the day from the notice paper. They are all reports that this parliament has had no opportunity to debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had in this place a most dramatic decline in ministerial statements, which were once important. I apologise for not having had the opportunity to speak in advance to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, about this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I was considering dashing across the room a few minutes ago, but then I thought I might miss the call, because I was a bit unsure of when the previous debate was going to end&mdash;but I want to have incorporated into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a table which shows the pattern of ministerial statements in the House of Representatives from 1970 to 1993. It details the number of statements made, the amount of time spent on them, and the percentage of House debating time spent on each statement. The table shows that the number of statements in 1970 was 63, and that that has declined to four this year. The total time spent on such statements in 1970 was 11.58 hours, this year it was 1.22 hours. The percentage of total House time spent in debating ministerial statements was 2.1 per cent in 1970, and that has declined to 0.4 per cent this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the report of the procedure committee, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time&mdash;bills, questions and working hours</EMPHASIS>. I take the opportunity at the outset to commend the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), for his diligent work in getting this report through for consideration in this session. I also thank the committee secretary, Robyn Webber, and the staff of the committee for the effort they put in to what I believe is an important report. It is one that is designed very squarely to ensure the continuing relevance and dynamic role of this House as part of the parliamentary process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having listened to the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), I do not want to dwell too much on what was said. I would have to say that when the committee deliberated on these issues there was a very strong attempt to achieve consensus across the whole range of issues. Indeed, the majority report has the support of opposition as well as government members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not a case of the committee undertaking a task designed to be beneficial to the executive; it was about trying to ensure that all of us, as members of parliament, had the most productive role possible in the parliament. It took account of many of the criticisms that are raised not just by members of the House but also by people outside the parliament as far as the operation of the House of Representatives is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has to be viewed as a package. I do not think the opposition can say, `We would like to see these reforms because they might be beneficial to the opposition', or that we on our side can say, `We would like to see certain reforms because they might be advantageous to the executive or to the government'. Rather, what the report should be about is ensuring that the House of Representatives continues to have a productive role and that all those who have the privilege to serve here in the future can be part of a productive process as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had regard to some of the experiences of parliaments in other parts of the world relating to parliamentary proceedings. The practice in the Australian parliament is to have a very strong legislative framework compared to many other parliaments around the world and we wanted to ensure that we could make the most productive use of the time that honourable members spend here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, many people raised their legitimate concern concerning the reform of sitting hours. That concern is shared across the community. Many people believe that our sitting hours are a relic of past times and that members now need to be treated in a contemporary way given the range of responsibilities that they have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disappointing therefore, having tried to achieve those objectives, and in large measure fulfilling those criteria, that we now have a view expressed that there was not enough attempt at consultation. The chairman did consult and the committee tossed ideas backwards and forwards and compromised on certain matters. Many of us probably had other things we would have liked to see happen but the dialogue worked effectively in the committee. So to come here and hear others suggest that there are elements of substantial division is not a correct reflection of the committee's deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important matter that I would like to refer to relates to the use of the second chamber that is proposed in the report. The honourable member for Moncrieff and all of us are concerned about the time we have to speak and deliberate on matters. There are many bills that come before the House because of our practice of having a very strong legislative framework to what we do. That means that there is desirability for discussion on legislation that is introduced but in many instances there is no division. Certain bills do not have contentious aspects that lead to a division in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of criticism of the use of the guillotine and the belief that there is little chance for people to deliberate fully on many of the bills, this led us to recommend the creation of a second chamber where those non-divisive issues could be discussed. We believe it would be productive to have detailed discussion in such a chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something that should be welcomed because that would give many, particularly backbenchers, a chance to make a real contribution in debates. They can develop expertise in an area. The second chamber would not always be governed by the time constraints that the present chamber is now governed by. There would not be the contention that some of the bills that come before the House have where there are predetermined views and positions that automatically lead to that process that would need to be pursued in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the proceedings of this session of parliament one can point to bills that would have been just as effectively debated through that second chamber process. Equally, a bill like the Native Title Bill would remain as part of this chamber because of the nature of the discussion and because of the position that the government and the opposition have adopted. So members would have had a chance to not only have that bill debated but others that might be less contentious would be debated thoroughly and constructively in another chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one amalgamates that proposal with the amendments that the committee proposes relating to the use of standing committees and so on, which has been one of the successful reforms of recent years of the parliament, there is then a process which gives all honourable members a chance to have a far greater input into the parliamentary process. Also, it provides the community at large with a chance to see, more precisely, the sorts of endeavours that members of parliament are undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a recommendation that is advantageous to the House and to its members. I do not think it is one that is going to be disadvantageous to the opposition in any sense, but it is certainly a recommendation that is helpful to the whole House and, particularly, to the 147 members here with the limitations we all have on the time we can speak on many important issues. The contribution that honourable members make can then be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the criticism relating to question time, the opposition should be prepared to acknowledge what the committee proposes in relation to question time. It proposes to address many of the criticisms that not only the opposition but others in the community have raised about the role that question time should play in the parliament. Specific requirements are included about the number of questions. An important reform is that it would enable a broader range of issues and a broader range of portfolio areas to be covered by all members. That is proposed in the trial measure of rostering arrangements for each sitting Monday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those changes will ensure the relevance of question time. They will ensure that members obtain the detailed information they seek at question time. The feeling of the community at large that the accountability of the executive is more appropriately addressed through those changes should also be welcomed by all members of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statistics show that in general it is the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the senior opposition executive people who ask the majority of questions from the opposition side. The vast majority of questions are directed to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) or the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). Legitimate questions could be raised in many areas of public policy. That rostered arrangement on a Monday does seem to provide the scope for more breadth in the detail of issues that all members of parliament, particularly backbench members, can raise relating to matters to do with electorates and general public policy and portfolio areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having witnessed this system working in the House of Commons, I believe it is certainly worth having the trial that the committee has advocated in its report. It is one, I am sure, which will help to maintain the right dynamics and ensure the relevance of the question time process in the parliament. The recommendation that the time be moved marginally will, overall, be beneficial to all members, but it will be particularly beneficial to the leadership on both sides of the chamber, given the other commitments they inevitably have during a sitting week. That is the sort of reform that should be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other recommendations in the report, as I said, which relate to the role of standing committees. I welcome the enhancement that is proposed there. In regard to the hours, the reforms are certainly overdue. Very few people outside this place can understand why we have the sorts of hours we have now. I appreciate that there is a history of reforms in this area which have not always gone as far as members would like, but that is not a reason for not being serious about the reform of the hours and operations of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than be defeatist about that because of past changes that did not flow in the way the committee wished, we should be getting behind the report. It will be beneficial to the House as a whole, and it will certainly be beneficial to individual members of the House. I believe the committee's report goes a long way towards maintaining the very important role our House has in the democratic process in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a person who was not on the committee, I am pleased  to have this opportunity to make a contribution. I have to admit to being a bit slow in making a written contribution, but there were reasons for that. I thank the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) for being in the chamber to hear these additional comments. That shows his interest in the subject and I am grateful for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the opposition have a point of concern that I would like to record at the beginning. The documentation does not record a submission by the opposition. Apparently, we did make a submission, and the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) assures me that she personally distributed that submission to honourable members. That is a technical point, but we would like to see the record corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My contribution is primarily to talk about the second chamber, which I endorse wholeheartedly. In fact, I would like to add to the concept, because I feel that the committee, in trying to come up with what would appear a revolutionary proposal, has possibly tried to weaken it a bit, when in fact it is quite a simple proposition, if we stop and look at it, in the context of a second debating chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view is that the thing we lack most in this place is debating time. The honourable member for Moncrieff referred to committee reports and such things. It is the greatest joke in the world to say in this place, `The report should be noted'. That means the rubbish bin, in the current context, and yet there are very serious matters dealt with in those committees and no doubt many honourable members would like to put something on the record about them. Let me say that the parliamentary debate in this place is substantially about putting things on the record. We know what the outcome is going to be in most cases, particularly in this place, and it is a case of honourable members having the opportunity to put things on the record. Speakers lists often are quite surprising. The pig levy bill will always get a very large speaking contingent, from both sides of the House, when some other matters, which one might think very technical and very important, attract a much smaller number of speakers. It is frequently the non-controversial bills that attract the speakers because it gives honourable members the opportunity to refer to matters and bring matters to the attention of the government. So I think the issue is debating time, and the second chamber would provide that, substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the second chamber should be able to be construed within our standing orders or our rules to be just that. I do not know that it has to have special committee relativity, notwithstanding that I support wholeheartedly the concept that all votes be taken in this chamber. In fact, I see a situation arising on occasions where during a debate an uncontested matter, because of a contribution of an honourable member, becomes contestable, and we will have to have a mechanism to bring it back in here. I do not think that is beyond our resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe also that there is no need to make the operations of the two chambers concurrent. When one raises the problems of party meetings and ministry meetings and so on, I see no reason why the second chamber could not be operating at that time. In the context of the Labor caucus, honourable members opposite would have to think about how they would record votes, considering that a vote might be tight and some people might be in that second chamber. But, because they do vote and have ballots, there should be a way around even that. In the context of the Liberal Party room that is not a problem because we do not vote. But those little things can be resolved. In setting the program for the two chambers, considering we would be sending to the second chamber the matters which were deemed non-controversial, that could be operating literally nine to five, Monday through Thursday, to make a simple analogy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole issue is one of a chamber to extend debating time and, where practical, to make sure that the matters listed for the secondary chamber were matters that were of that nature, and where honourable members could have the opportunity to debate. It opens up even the question of how long we might have to debate but, when we consider all the reports and so on that might go in there, we would have quite a lot of extra matters coming onto the notice paper. Of course, that allocation of legislation is simply an administrative matter to be dealt with from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can make an interesting comparison with the Senate. Because the constitution stipulates that there should be twice as many members of this chamber as there are in the Senate, we sit roughly the same sitting hours but get half the debating time of a senator. That is a simple fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure of that. I think that over time we have put ourselves in the position of demeaning our role somewhat through some of the circumstances that have arisen, and I think that in terms of legislation we would bring great credit to this parliament if we looked at a program that emanated to a degree from within the parliament. I make no apology for my arguments in trying to force legislation into this chamber as early as possible, and I have argued within our own forums that the first weeks of a session should be taken up with the tabling of legislation and the second reading speeches in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We always talk about the debating time available to us but we never talk about the time to communicate with the community. None of us is expert on everything that comes before this place. We rely heavily on advice from outside the parliament and, too frequently, the problem is not the time we have in this place; it is the time we have to go and consult with the community and do those sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe very strongly that we should require a process whereby in a government's program, subject to the decision of the parliament&mdash;in other words, if some urgent matter comes up, it can always be dealt with&mdash;the first thing we should do in every sitting period is put the matters on the record and then get on with the debates and the allocation. I think that too is important in the context of these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also very concerned about some suggestions on question time. Honourable members would not be surprised that I am not very much in favour of the sin bin. I do not really think that would be very wise and, in fact, it would be a situation that might make it just a bit too easy for the Speaker when it is a prerogative of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that question time should be in the mornings. I have experienced it in the Fraser government. Fraser was very strong on the point that it set the tone for the day, that it got people into the chamber early in the day, and there are other good reasons. It should be followed by the matter of public importance and the matter of public importance should have a decent quorum associated with it. I do not know whether it is a matter of tactics, or what it is, but I think it demeans this place when people get up as the matter of public importance commences and walk out. In our own interests and for our own reputations we should think about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;I think that at least one MPI per week should be allocated to the government. What is more, it should be used wherever practical for ministerial statements, and I believe that the government should use it for that purpose. Surely they are matters of public importance and surely they should be put down in a constructive way and the opposition, of course, can respond. That should be made a rule. I would like to put the obligation on the government, if you like, but I would urge that it be used in that particular way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of things we need to look at. I believe that general business Thursdays proved the point that we do not need lunch and dinner breaks in the chambers. I believe that we can all adjust to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe too that we should have a right, entrenched even in the law, for oppositions. I remind the House that we all get our turn at government and opposition, and opposition should have a right to at least request the suspension of standing orders in terms of a censure. A censure should be used sensibly but, on the other hand, it is far too important to have it struck out in a parliament. I do not think it should ever happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also oppose the ministers' roster. I am not sure that that is necessary considering particularly the advent of parliamentary secretaries and extra debating time that would ensue. I think question time could be given an excellent focus. It is the time we keep the executive honest, and I remind honourable members that they can be of either political colour. I believe that the situation should not be changed or we would regret it as a House. </PARA>

This is one of the issues, as the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) highlighted, that need to be addressed. We have a lot of important government and national business that is recorded in reports in this place which we never get the opportunity to consider in some detail. So that is one of many issues that I would like to comment on in this brief discussion this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having not been a member of the committee but, having been very interested in this issue since I came to this place almost four years ago, I wish to commend the chairman of the committee and all its members for the hard work that they have put in in producing this report. It is important to recognise that this is not a party political debate, this is not a partisan issue; this is members of this chamber on both sides seeking to achieve some major reforms of the procedures. I think absolutely every member of this place recognises that there is a need for major reform of the procedures of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some ridiculous structures and times for debate. We are limiting our opportunities to do the job that we are here for, which is to put on public record and to debate matters of national interest and of concern to our constituents. We have to make sure that the government of the day&mdash;whether we are members of the governing party or members of the opposition&mdash;is able to listen to the concerns and views of our constituents. It is my view that, unfortunately, there is very little opportunity for backbench members on either side of this chamber to do the real job that they are here for&mdash;to represent their constituents' interests in the debates on legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that needs to be recognised is that the business of governments in 1993 is far more complex and detailed than it was when a lot of these procedures were set up. We need to make some major reforms of the operations of this place to reflect the fact that there is a lot more legislation being put into this chamber and a lot more complex debate occurring or needing to occur on matters of government. We need to make those major changes to enable that to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I support the concept of the committee stage of legislation being shifted to a separate place&mdash;the honourable member for O'Connor called it a second chamber&mdash;and having it absorb that committee stage where there is agreement on both sides that it is a bill that is non-controversial. </PARA>

So, when we have debate on very important pieces of legislation limited to 40 or 50 minutes, members of parliament are being denied the opportunity to do their job. We need to make some radical reforms to reduce or, if that is not possible, eliminate the use of the guillotine. I know there will be occasions when the guillotine will be required but they should be extremely limited. The guillotine has been very much overused in the four years that I have been here and it is something that we need to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the second chamber reform would have the effect of enabling more time to be spent on debating those bills that often are the subject of the guillotine at the moment. The controversial and therefore vigorous debates where there are strong differences of opinion between government and opposition could then receive more time here as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the concept of a second chamber, although there is need for some changes to the committee's suggested format. If we support the concept in principle, I think we will then have the opportunity to reduce markedly the use of the guillotine, which will greatly benefit the process of democracy in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member. I am now going to get nervous since it is described as a courageous effort on my part. I think there are many people on this side of the chamber who also agree that the guillotine is overused. We appreciate the fact that the government does have some requirements to get legislation through. The way in which the guillotine has been used to such an extensive degree in these last three years is a reflection of the fact that the business of government now is a very complex affair and that there are a lot more pieces of legislation needing to be debated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also agree with the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in that I do not believe that we need to have set lunch breaks or dinner breaks in the timetable. If honourable members look at the way in which Thursdays operate, it does not create any great difficulty that we do not have a lunch break. On second Wednesdays, we do not have a dinner break and this does not interfere with the operation of the debates in this chamber. I do not think we need to actually include the breaks in the timetable. This will allow several more hours each week for debates to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view is that the timetable needs to be amended so that we eliminate those set dinner breaks and lunch breaks; I do not think they are required. I also believe that there needs to be some flexibility in the timing of question time. I think where it is at the moment is too restrictive. It does prevent other activities from occurring around that time of day. I also share the concern of the opposition that maybe 3.30 p.m. is too late. I think that, if we eliminated the lunch breaks, we could in fact make some adjustment to the time of question time so that it was more reflective of the needs of the government, the opposition and the media who take a great interest in question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I would like to talk about is the need for more time for consideration of reports. I mentioned this earlier. I believe that we do not get enough time in this chamber to debate reports. In the last parliament, I was on three standing committees. I felt that they were three very good standing committees; a lot of hard work was put into examining and considering major issues of national importance. After months and months of work&mdash;in fact, on a couple of occasions, it was two years of very solid work&mdash;we would come here and have 40 minutes to debate on the matter. Having spent two years travelling around the country, talking to a lot of people, putting a lot of effort into thinking about which way we should go, my personal contribution to debate would be five minutes. I would have five minutes to sum up all the issues that I had under consideration for two years. Now I chair a standing committee, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs committee, and when I present the report of that committee in a couple of weeks time, I am going to get 10 minutes to talk about something that we have spent seven or eight months working on. I just do not think that is reasonable. There is not an appreciation around the country of the enormous amount of work that is put in by honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA>Australia is a democratic society and with both rights and responsibilities of its citizens defined in statute or recognised in principles underlying the common law. Among those societal values which we hold to be inalienable are the rights of free speech and freedom of association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our labour law, our industrial relations legislation, recognises the right of employees to form associations for industrial purposes concerned with their employment. We call these associations unions. That same legislation recognises the rights of employers to form associations for similar purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill addresses a major inequity which has existed in practice, if not in law, since Federation. That inequity is the right of individuals to make a choice about whether to join a union or a representative organisation. States and federal law and courts have always upheld the rights of employers to form organisations and the rights of employees to form and join unions. For a long time, both state and federal governments have countenanced the concept of the closed shop in industrial relations. The closed shop requires all employees of an industry or an enterprise to belong to a trade union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993, which left this House for the Senate earlier this week, contains a clause which states that an employer must not terminate an employee's employment for reason of union membership. However, the legislation nowhere states the contrary, that an employer shall not terminate an employee's work by reason of that employee's non-membership of a union or an association. The government's reform bill also makes it an offence to induce an employee to stop being an officer, delegate or member of an organisation or association. It fails, however, to provide symmetry by saying that it should also be an offence to induce an employee to join a union or association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), during the committee stage of debate on government and opposition amendments to the reform bill, committed himself to carefully examine opposition proposed amendments which would, for the first time, guarantee in statute the end of the closed shop. During debate on the reform bill and during the committee stage, I foreshadowed this bill which I introduce today. This is the second time that my private member's bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives, the former occasion being on 6 December 1990. In the last parliament, that bill did receive a second reading debate on 16 May 1991 but, as is usual with the government in these matters, the bill was not allowed to proceed to the third stage or to a vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A research poll in 1992 found that 87 per cent of Australians thought that trade union membership should be voluntary. There is a vast difference between union membership in the public and private sector, with the public sector propping up the entire system. I believe in the right of unions to exist but I also believe that they should compete fairly, based on services which they provide to their members and in a voluntary and not a compulsory sense. This bill in its several parts is designed to ensure that membership or non-membership of an organisation does not affect employment; that is, it gives full effect to the concept of voluntary union membership and voluntary membership of associations. </PARA>

<PARA>I was pleased when approached by one of my constituents, the President of the Ukrainian Council of New South Wales, Jurij Dechnicz, to move a motion that is very similar to one passed in the US House of Representatives, following a 1984-85 decision by that body to establish a commission on the Ukraine famine. It came before that house on 12 October of this year, and a motion was passed with wording similar to this one. In the Ukraine itself on 7 February, there was a momentous decision by the central committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party, recognising the crime of the Ukraine. In the period from 10 to 12 September in the Ukraine, there were days of sorrow in remembrance of the victims and there was a declaration of a national day of mourning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to early postwar migrant settlement in Merrylands and Birrong, three of the 10 largest municipal concentrations of Ukrainians in Australia in 1993 are in the three municipalities which constitute my electorate. The surrounding municipalities of Bankstown and Fairfield have similarly large concentrations. I have been fortunate in the last few years to play an active role in a number of matters raised by the Ukrainian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters cover a range of issues, including charities to support the Chernobyl children; diplomatic representation in this country; the reality of a trade imbalance in our intake from the Ukraine; and sister city relationships. I am pleased to note that one of these three municipalities, Auburn, has been very active in establishing a tie with a Ukrainian city. Also, there has been the establishment of a friendship society within this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of the famine, which was largely precipitated by government action, was underlined by the 1959 census in the Soviet Union which, for the Ukraine, indicated a situation of 4.7 million more women than men. That sort of thing does not happen by accident. That situation was caused by the war, the terror instituted by the Soviet government, and the famine. That massive imbalance in population was demonstrated in that first census after the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to examine the history of the famine. In 1926, 21 per cent of the total harvest in the Ukraine was forcibly taken by the central Soviet government. In 1930, the government increased that percentage to 30 per cent with a bumper harvest. The problem was that the central government authorities failed to recognise that that particularly large harvest was abnormal. It was also attributable to extraction of all stocks, reserves and seeds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1931, when the total harvest in the Ukraine dwindled to 18.3 million metric tonnes, the central Soviet government pressed ahead and succeeded in extracting 91 per cent of what was a much lower total harvest to meet its targets. That led to a very strong movement of people to the cities and into central Russia. It was to lead eventually to extremely repressive moves by the central government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in 1931 and 1932 the area under cultivation dwindled greatly. There were massive losses in the actual amount of crop collected. This did not really stop the central government. It did not set it back. In 1932, at the Kharkov conference, Molotov and Kaganovich stamped on all local opposition. That opposition, it is fairly important to note, occurred even within the Ukrainian Communist Party. I will come to that at a later point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central Soviet government refused to accede to any of the concerns which were being expressed by the local population. It ignored the starvation that was spreading throughout the Ukraine and strongly pressed ahead with its measures. Thus, on 7 August 1932, the government implemented a piece of legislation which was related to the fact I mentioned earlier about people drifting out of farming areas because of the starvation situation there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That measure basically attempted to further restrict people's movements. On 20 November 1932, the government used emergency measures to retract all wage payments that had occurred. It reclaimed more grain and requisitioned seed and forage. The next month, internal passports were instituted which required the registration of individuals. That, of course, was a measure that was to be very much criticised in the following decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on 17 March 1933 measures were introduced to prohibit collective farmers from moving to factories or mines. This was to deal with the massive problem caused by the high requisitioning of crops. Basically the government took most of the crop, and the amount left for farmers kept dwindling the whole time, with the result that farmers were being hit by hunger and the farming situation was deteriorating further. But the government failed to look at the reality of that declining crop and to adjust accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 14 December 1932, with a degree of opposition from the Ukrainian Communist Party, the central Soviet leadership accused the Ukrainian Communist Party leadership of what it termed `nationalist deviation'. The membership of that party declined from 520,000 in June 1932 to 470,000 in October 1933. Events led on 7 July 1933 to the suicide of Nicholas Skrypnyk, perhaps the leading Ukrainian communist, as the central authorities said that the measures instituted by them were being undermined, supposedly by a Ukrainian nationalist leadership, and that really the Ukrainians were responsible for these failed measures.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an article on this matter, Victor Swoboda has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The OGPU&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the security police&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">terror of 1929-33 was not directed against non-communists alone. Any manifestations of national communism were also punished. When the Ukrainian communist leaders repeatedly appealed to Moscow to alleviate the 1932-33 famine by reducing grain delivery quotas from the Ukraine, the central committee of the Soviet party refused, accused the Ukrainian leadership of nationalism, blamed it for the non-fulfilment of the quotas and a new wave of OGPU terror was unleashed. Between June 1 1932 and October 1 1933 75 per cent of officials of the local Soviets and 80 per cent of the local party secretaries were dismissed, and by late 1934 half of the rank and file were purged. Most were shot or exiled.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the central leadership had over a period of years continually increased the requirements on the Ukraine, which was, and still is today, the breadbasket in that region. That is a major economic reality of the independent Ukrainian state. The central leadership failed to take heed of, or deliberately went ahead despite, the very grave results its actions were having on the population. I referred earlier to the population imbalance that was evidenced in the 1959 census. It is claimed with a fair degree of certitude that between seven million and 10 million Ukrainians died during this period. Victor Swoboda further commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The speed of the collectivisation without the necessary machinery and the exorbitant demands for grain from Moscow culminated in the catastrophic famine of 1932-3. A Soviet law authorising the OGPU to shoot on sight anyone who attempted to steal `socialist property' was applied throughout the Ukraine, sometimes against starving children.</PARA>
<PARA>A similar motion to that I have moved was supported in the US Congress. To put this in some kind of context, I quote from the statement of one of the movers of that motion, Congressman Rohrbacher:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let us all, as we look back at this crime of 60 years ago, as this resolution suggests, vow to one another that we will not remain silent as people are sent to their death, whether it is in communist China or whether it is in fascist right wing regimes that perhaps wave American flags when the American ambassador arrives on the scene.</PARA>

<PARA>It is appropriate to consider, as did the honourable member for Reid, the appalling situation in the Ukraine during the period in question. When I was approached to speak on this motion, I must confess that I had little knowledge of those horrible events 60 years ago&mdash;in my electorate of Fisher we have a very small Ukrainian community&mdash;but when I looked at what had occurred I was horrified. After a previous term in politics and many years practising law it takes quite a lot to shock me, but when I looked at the facts of that sad period of Ukrainian history I was totally appalled. What happened is a case study of the failure of the policies of socialism and communism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Communists and socialists love central planning. The honourable member for Reid highlighted how edicts kept emanating from Moscow to be imposed on the local community. Pleadings by local communists on behalf of the people of the Ukraine fell on deaf ears. The only response received from Stalin, Molotov and others was that the Ukrainian people were simply manifesting a form of nationalism which was to be stamped out at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the grain harvest in the Ukraine is indeed a history of the failure of the collectivisation of farms. The inefficiencies which occurred as a result of collectivisation moved the situation very much towards the famine of 1932-33. Prior to the famine, there had been a good harvest, but the central authorities kept imposing ever higher quotas that were unattainable, while the Ukraine was constantly criticised over its failure to meet these quotas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the basis for the insistence by the central authorities on obtaining so much grain from the Ukraine was that the Soviet Union needed to purchase capital equipment from overseas, and in order to do so needed to export more agricultural produce. Therefore, the quotas which were imposed on the Ukraine were constantly increased to a stage where they were simply not able to be met. Over a very short period, the total quota of grain demanded by the central authorities from the Ukraine was increased by a massive 2.3 times. Initially, there was an incentive given to peasants to join collectives because their quotas were three times lower than those for farms which were not collectivised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note that the Ukrainian harvest was only 27 per cent of the entire harvest of the Soviet Union, but the central authorities demanded that the Ukraine supply 38 per cent of the total grain procurements of the USSR; that helped to create a tragedy. When one looks at the response of the central authorities to the understandable failure by the Ukraine to meet the quotas, it appears to be a very similar situation to the Holocaust which occurred in the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the farmers were not used to operating on a collective basis, a very large percentage of the harvest was lost in harvesting. I have statistics here that are constant exhibitions of the horror that was imposed on the Ukraine during that period. The Communist Party sent out large numbers of people to the Ukrainian countryside to forage for grain to be seized. In fact, at one stage it had 40,000 of its members in the countryside, but that number increased to 112,000 as the party sent people out to try to extract grain, from ordinary Ukrainian peasants, to meet Moscow's very unreasonable quotas. Indeed, even the seed grain was seized. One does not have to be a mental giant to appreciate that if one takes the seed grain it is going to be absolutely impossible to sow anything like the amount of grain that is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have this situation where the grain crop declined and the amount of cultivated land was reduced. Then there was the reduction in coal output which reduced the availability of fuel. There were other problems with the railroads in the Ukraine and the metallurgical industries and the result of all of this was that the economy of the Ukraine fell into a very grave crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The communists called a conference. They brought along people from the Ukraine and people from the central government but, as was indicated previously, the sum total of that conference was that Moscow said, `We don't care how you extract this grain from the people of the Ukraine but you must do so'. There was a great tug of war over the harvest. People were going out there seizing the property of individuals to meet Moscow's unreasonable quotas. There was a reign of terror throughout the countryside. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union gave authority to shoot anyone who attempted to steal what it described as the socialist property of collective farms. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek an urgent review of state and federal natural disaster relief procedures and programs for all Australians who have been affected by natural disaster and for those who will inevitably and unhappily be affected in the future. In particular, I seek the review as well as urgent, additional help for the people and communities in the north-east, central highlands and Goulburn Valley of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 October 1993 a flood described by a state emergency coordinator as the worst natural disaster since Ash Wednesday swept into cities and districts of Wangaratta, Benalla, Myrtleford, Bright, Oxley, Euroa, Violet Town and Shepparton. Final estimates of damage to farms, homes, shops, factories and public assets have not yet been able to be calculated, but an estimate prepared by Emergency Management Australia, formerly known as the Natural Disasters Organisation, reveals that 10,000-plus people were affected, 6,500-plus homes, shops and factories were damaged, 6,500-plus people were evacuated, 4,000-plus kilometres of fencing were destroyed and 5,000-plus livestock were destroyed. An estimate at this stage of $200 million of total damage is yet to be confirmed but the figure is obviously very large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Crops and land damage have not yet been fully assessed but, in the Myrtleford area, 20 per cent of tobacco crops alone were destroyed. Hops and other crops were also devastated. The flooding was a catastrophe of unparalleled proportions. Some communities have recovered quite well; all are trying valiantly to overcome the aftermath and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would know the great spirit of the people who live in regional parts of Australia and how courageous they are in adversity. I would like to pay tribute to all emergency workers, volunteers and relief agencies from churches, Red Cross, CWA, service clubs, local government and government organisations who helped and are still helping so many of the victims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, cities such as Benalla are still in very serious difficulties although they are recovering. It is a pleasure to visit them and to see their brave faces. I know that my friends on the other side were there the other day and I thank them for going there. The October floods devastated the central business district of Benalla and many farms in the area. The social fabric of this community has been severely threatened because of the massive devastation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Myrtleford and Bright areas many hectares of valuable farmland have been devastated&mdash;some of the most valuable and productive farmland in Australia. Some farmers and their families have been left with a lunar-like landscape, with craters, rocks and debris strewn over what was rich farmland. The plight of tobacco growers, already the victims of state and federal policies to reduce smoking through excise but which totally ignore the need for a decent fair go for them to help cope and adjust to those government policies, is a matter of very great concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have farmers, small businesses and landlords who need special assistance and help, but so far many have not been able to bridge the gulf that exists in the state and federal programs. Despite the valuable assistance which has been given or promised to date, in particular by the state government, and which I would like to thank both Commonwealth and state governments for, there is clear evidence that the existing guidelines, that both governments work under and that have been used by state and federal governments in the past and in the present, are inadequate and need urgent review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I urge federal and state governments to immediately provide special assistance in the form of grants to enable farmers and small business to re-establish; to introduce more flexibility into aid programs, for example, to permit farmers and small businesses to apply the low interest rate loans that some of them have been offered towards repaying or reducing existing high interest loans; to agree to organisations such as skillshare and other relevant agencies being funded to enable the unemployed to help tackle some of the flood damage that is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal and state governments should be involved, in my view, from day one of the major disaster. I recognise the constitutional responsibilities of the governments, but they should be involved nevertheless from day one together, as partners. There is only one successful team, Mr Deputy Speaker, and that is a united one, one sharing all the challenges and all the responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government should amend its legislation to unshackle the Minister for Defence and permit the minister to make a declaration of major disaster. Under present federal law, such a declaration can only be made by the federal minister if there is death,</PARA>
<PARA>injury and major property damage. In our case, in north-east Victoria, thankfully, no deaths occurred but huge damage has. The federal minister says he cannot make a major disaster declaration because the criterion in his act, death plus damage, has not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disaster insurance needs to be reviewed. Many people miss out because of the act of God. Others can claim on their insurance because they are `lucky', because something else caused the water to enter their building. We should establish a national natural disaster insurance scheme so that everyone can have protection from the consequences of natural disasters. We should have a parliamentary committee re-examine all existing state and federal natural disaster insurance and programs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We should act now to tackle this problem. Emergency cash grants should be available to small business and farmers. Improvements are needed in providing immediate disaster recovery advice, for example, how to disinfect homes, treatment of carpets, et cetera. Lengthy delays in implementing scheme mechanics must be eliminated. In our case, several weeks elapsed before grant applications processes were introduced. Rural financial loans do not respond in every case to the real needs of small businesses and farmers. There is a need to recognise that special assistance is required. Volunteers helping disaster victims should not be precluded, as some were, I understand, from claiming special social security benefits because the application was late because they were out helping others and did not go in and claim for themselves first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government needs much more support and needs speedier and more flexible approvals for carrying out the massive rebuilding and restoration program of public property. Funds should be allocated, in my view, on a replacement cost basis and not on an historical restoration cost basis. Immediate seeding grants should be made to flood recovery committees. Uniform language should be used in the insurance industry so that people understand better the insurance that is offered to them. More education should occur anyway on what can and cannot be insured in Australia. More funding is needed to address medium- and long-term social problems, for example, the housing for elderly people affected by the floods, counselling for people involved and stress management. Reviews of flood and disaster warning systems are also required, in my view urgently, to eliminate some inadequacies that emerged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak here today on the motion moved by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman). I appreciate the concern which drives the honourable member for Indi to move this motion, supported by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). Going to the flood-ravaged areas of Victoria at a time close to the peak of those floods, and again during the subsequent wash-up, gave me a clear understanding of the needs of the people of Benalla, Myrtleford, Shepparton, Numurka, Nathalia and the other flooded areas in the Echuca and Wodonga regions. It gave me the opportunity to speak to the people of the flood-affected areas whilst they were dealing with the event and subsequently when they were trying to come to terms with it, both emotionally and financially.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the honourable member for Indi has also experienced the immediate and the after-effects of the flooding and is acting in the interests of his constituents when he puts this motion to the House. I think it is a concern that is shared with the people of that area by the honourable member moving the motion and by all members of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the past few years I have been involved in organising delegations from the New South Wales flood mitigation authorities to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to discuss flood problems in New South Wales and the role the Commonwealth may play in helping to mitigate flooding. In 1990 I organised for a delegation to meet New South Wales parliamentary Labor Party members whose electorates had flooding problems so that they could help in pushing for greater assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast majority of the New South Wales electorates with a substantial flooding problem are Labor electorates, and so it is a problem that affects not just Liberal Party or National Party electorates. My electorate of Page has some of the most serious flooding on the east coast of Australia. Lismore suffers the most dramatic flooding. Floods regularly inundate the main commercial centre, causing damage worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to business and interrupting agricultural activities in the surrounding rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most honourable members would be aware that I was a publican in a former life. The hotel that I own at the moment, which is a recent building in Lawrence on the Clarence River, becomes an island during flooding on the Clarence. In the previous hotel patrons would stand knee-deep&mdash;or thigh-deep&mdash;for their daily drop. On one occasion I recall serving a beer to a chap who was sitting in a boat in the bar. Everything surrounding that hotel was under water&mdash;cane farms, dairy farms, beef properties, homes&mdash;and the loss of personal effects and production capacity of the agricultural areas was massive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The residents always have an amazing resilience. Floods do seem to bring the community together, and although they may have suffered financial loss the community seems stronger as a result. On the Clarence flooding is something the residents have come to terms with. It happens regularly, so they just deal with it in the best possible way they can, but the recent flooding in Victoria was something different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 100-year flood, as the terminology suggests, does not happen very often. If it happened in my electorate base of Grafton, the town would be devastated. Levy protection there has given a false sense of security that leaves residents vulnerable. If we had the same type of 100-year flood that Victoria suffered, almost every home and every business would be inundated and the loss of personal property would be inestimable. It was this type of flooding or, more appropriately, the frequency of flooding which caused so much trouble in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Flooding of that magnitude just cannot be planned for adequately, and this government recognises the need to make sure every avenue of assistance available to the people of the flood-ravaged areas is delivered as soon as possible. That is why the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and the honourable member for Murray&mdash;the former Deputy Leader of the National Party&mdash;together with myself and a number of other members of this House travelled to those areas, along with the then member for Indi, and that is why I made a point of taking the Prime Minister's rural and regional task force on the first visit to that area to determine how effective government programs had been in providing assistance to the people in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is reasonable to say that whatever is done can always be done better. I think we can do better as a government. If presented with the same circumstances now, I am sure the program delivery from the federal government agencies would be better. As chairman of the rural and regional task force, I have recommended a number of measures which should be implemented by the government. I will outline those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government should allocate additional rural counsellors, perhaps on a temporary basis, in the flood affected regions to help local families return to stability and profitability. I believe that is partly being addressed through the appointment of a temporary officer at this stage. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) should investigate the possibility of introducing special disaster provisions, such that retrospective benefits may be paid to those who have been affected by natural disasters. This is also, I believe, being addressed through the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personal counselling services should be seen as an important part of the recovery process for those affected. Therefore, a commitment to providing adequate coun-selling services to those in need is essential. This may also be done through rural counselling schemes. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) should look towards the jobskill and LEAP programs for proposals that will assist the flood affected communities. I think that is also being explored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth should investigate the possibility of producing a readily available emergency information guide that would be suitable for people in these types of disasters, with details of what to do, et cetera. A meeting between the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and other relevant bodies should be set up so as to minimise further difficulties experienced during the summer months with the growth of algae in the local waterways around Benalla, due to the increased levels of nutrients which will be deposited in the waterways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy should investigate what assistance and funding could be directed to assist in the restoration and repair of damage caused to land and vegetation in the flood affected areas under the national landcare program. The Commonwealth should also look at ways to enter into discussions with the Victorian state government in order to ensure that the people of the flood affected areas receive the necessary assistance they are entitled to under national disaster relief arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the honourable member for Indi will recognise the importance and worth of these recommendations. I am confident that many of the concerns will be addressed. These recommendations, along with the report, will be given to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) today with a request that they be implemented without delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the benefits from the Department of Social Security is one of the honourable member's main concerns, and it is a realistic concern. People whose lives have been shattered by floods or any other natural disaster are hardly going to have a visit to the Department of Social Security at the forefront of their minds when they are getting their lives back in order. However, at present if they do not apply early they miss out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the national disaster relief arrangements go, that does put a threshold on state expenditure before Commonwealth funding comes in. I believe that type of mechanism is appropriate. It puts the onus on the state to prioritise the importance of disasters. It does this in monetary terms. As the major land and infrastructure managers, it is the states which are in the best position to assess the damage and prioritise it. Whether that is best done in monetary terms, as it is now, or whether some other mechanism could be found to do that effectively, I think should be explored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present arrangements, the federal government is automatically committed to massive funding if the states place importance on it. If, for instance, the $200 million mentioned by the honourable member for Indi were the figure that was spent under the NDRA, the majority of that would be federal government money. Of the $200 million, under the funding arrangements, in the vicinity of $120 million would be federal government money. So the question is: how should we prioritise? That is up to the states. It is done by the states in monetary terms at the moment. I think it is worth examination to see whether there is another appropriate method that could be used. At present, the priorities are with the states and it is their responsibility. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the mover of this motion, the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), and also the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), who visited the area along with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), for their concern over this devastating natural disaster which was caused by the freak rains in the north-east of Victoria on 3 October. The important point for many people in the electorate of Murray and elsewhere in that part of Victoria is that that disaster is continuing day in, day out in their lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were three segments to that particular disaster. Firstly, there was the north-east sector, which experienced very heavy rains, torrents of water, erosion, and the loss of stock, fences and many roads and bridges. Secondly, there was the city of Benalla, which was the main urban area affected. I am told that, so far, about 2,700 personal hardship grants have been made, which indicates the number of houses, particularly in Benalla, that have been affected. There have been 500 grants made to farms and homes in smaller towns, which shows the impact on those towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there was the electorate of Murray, where the floodwaters spread out over the plains of northern Victoria in one of the most intensively irrigated and farmed areas of Australia. There were no stock losses there but, if we take both the north and north-east areas, close to 1,000 farms have been affected, and about half of those severely. In the electorate of Murray alone, I would say that there has been a loss of income to farmers of at least $100 million, apart from any of the other losses. I know that the majority of those people were dairy farmers, but it has been indicated that many orchardists, tobacco growers, graziers and cropping farmers were also affected. Many of these people unfortunately have no future, or else their future is at risk because of the devastation to them and the fact that they have no cash flow now and are not likely to have any cash flow for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area devastated was three times that affected by the Ash Wednesday fires, the last great disaster of Victoria. That was of course not nearly the size of the area of the 1990-92 floods of Queensland and New South Wales, but the lost production would have been at least as great, because of the intensive farming in the area. The response of the Victorian government was swift, and I commend it for that. It introduced a state of emergency that allowed the Army to come in, and I commend the Army for the work it did, as I and others have commended all the other people such as the state emergency services, local government, state and federal departments, the thousands of volunteers, and even the CSIRO for the brochures it put out concerning how to cope with or re-establish a home that has been damaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the natural disaster relief arrangements were automatically triggered, because of the longstanding Commonwealth-state arrangement. There are two elements to that. Firstly, there are the personal and household grants, which are dollar for dollar, Commonwealth and state, from the first dollar. So far, there has been about $2 million worth of those personal hardship, temporary living expenses and rehabilitation grants, amounting to about $11,000 for each one, that have been distributed; and that amount could double. There has also been some provision of special benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is the element of business, both farm and town business, and the availability of the $100,000 four per cent loan. For community and voluntary organisations, the same procedure applies. So far, about 42 farms and 25 businesses have had their claims processed and approved, and over $3 million has been allocated. But those loans will have to go to hundreds of farms for them to have the impact that they should have. I note that the Victorian department of agriculture has provided $50,000 to help with financial consultants so that more of those applications can be successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally there are no grants for businesses affected, with the exception of the farm home. But farm homes do not generally go under floods, because the farmers have the equipment and the ability to make sure that they do not go under. In other natural disasters, there have been some grants for transport assistance for livestock and fodder. That money is not being provided in Victoria, and I believe it should be. There are also, as we have indicated, the special benefits. There is the question of the tax office, and of landcare, which the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) will address more completely; but all of us would support the importance of overcoming the erosion situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this motion is to emphasise the need for a review of the Commonwealth-state arrangements. The previous speaker has indicated some very important points in relation to that, as did the mover of the motion, the honourable member for Indi. The biggest problem is the bitterness that is created and is there now&mdash;I know it is not new, because the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who is at the table, is aware of this from the flood that he had to cope with a couple of years ago&mdash;in the business sector, which sees only loans being available to it, and very difficult to obtain loans at some stages, and grants being available to householders. Generally speaking, businesses cannot insure for a flood. So we have got people who are bankrupt, people with no cash flow, their livelihood at risk, able to get loans only; whereas there have been grants for householders, which is very important, but their livelihood is not at stake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been argued that this loan at four per cent is a concessional loan and that, over the five-year period of that loan, it about equals the $11,000 or so that is available for grants. I disagree with that argument. If the Commonwealth makes money available at about one per cent to the states and four per cent is charged, there is a normal lending margin, so there is nothing concessional in that. The obvious thing to do to bring equity to this, in my view, is to include the interest charge in the natural disaster arrangements and provide those loans at no interest. There is a precedent for this: in the exceptional circumstances provision of the rural adjustment scheme, where the Commonwealth and the state agree, no interest is charged, and I believe that would restore equity and a feeling of equity and fairness between the householder and the business person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The critical reality of the difference of treatment and the failure, at least as perceived by the people in north and north-eastern Victoria, is that there has been established a small business and farming flood trust fund, of which about $200,000 has been donated by business, by media people in the area and by individuals. That is separate from the Salvation Army appeal, which was also very significant, but for personal and household assistance. It is providing long-term assistance, for example, re-establishment of pastures on properties and so forth. That is what is needed, and the fact that that had to be set up shows the shortcomings of the existing arrangement. I do commend those people involved. I also make those points again about loans at no interest and including more clearly the self-employed and the business sector in the rehabilitation and temporary living grants, which quite often are refused to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Special benefit was provided very quickly by the Department of Social Security. I commend it for that and for the brochure it put out, but that is only available for two weeks. Here we are seven weeks later and there are people with no income, and I make two points. The first is that it should be available for a longer period. The second point, which has been made by previous speakers, is that there should be retrospective ability to apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On provisional tax, the Taxation Office says it will look sympathetically at readjustments because of the flood. I would like to see that stated more positively so that those affected know that next April they can make the guesstimate of what it will be and not have a penalty tax applied later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is infrastructure. Generally that is reasonable, and Victoria is up to about $21 million now with roads. But we have a problem. A community facility such as a cemetery is classed as a grant for any maintenance, but a football club room or a showground is not; it is available only for a loan. I believe community facilities should be in the grants sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point is levee banks. There is a tremendous problem here. They are within the natural disaster arrangements, so there is no argument on that. But no Victorian department will accept its responsibility so that people can go ahead and restore those levee banks, because of the legal liability that goes with it. That certainly has to be sorted out. I strongly support the motion that has been put forward that there is a need for an urgent review of the Commonwealth-state natural disaster arrangements with the lessons learnt from this particularly devastating flood. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I think that it is worth while pointing out to the House, and indeed to those who may be listening through the broadcast, that this is one of those occasions where, on all sides of politics, we collectively work together for the good of all our respective constituents. It is worth while pointing out that I represent the electorate of McEwen, which is adjacent to the electorates of Indi and Murray. The electorates which the three of us represent in this House all suffered damage caused by this flood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just your normal sort of flood. I know it has been said before, but I think it is important to stress that this is a flood of quite unusual characteristics. For example, in the Strathbogie Ranges, many of the higher areas are well-known aquifers where the water comes down the dry land as salinity later on. During this quite enormous rain, water entering the aquifers on the high ground of the Strathbogies actually burst out of the side of the hills. The water flow was so great that the area underground could not cope with this flow of water and some hillsides literally burst open with water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">King Valley is in my electorate; it is a lovely part of Australia. On all of the hillsides and the ranges around King Valley, ugly scars can now be seen. There has been enormous physical damage to the land. Things have happened there which frankly should never happen, in general terms, even in a flood. There are hillsides which are heavily forested. Of course, we all understand that, if we put trees on hills, we hold the soil together: we stop the degradation of the soil. In the King Valley, there are areas where heavily forested hills have literally been torn away. The forest is still there but there are enormous scars, which come down the hillside. It is beyond belief what has occurred there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The floods were so heavy in Benalla that they peaked at 1.2 metres above the highest recorded level. The locals say that they have never seen anything like it in their lives. The water literally came off the Strathbogie Ranges as a flood, as a wave of water, and just swept all before it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like everyone in this House, I am worried about the way the national disaster relief funding operates. What can be said to a farmer who has lost 100 dairy cows? That occurred in the King Valley. The farmer is looking at about $1,000 per cow replacement. He probably will not have the cash in his pocket to buy the cows. He is looking at a loss of income at the peak of the season. He was coming into the season; he had got his cows all joined; he was starting to milk; he was looking for a good cash flow. What happened? He lost 100 cows. He has now got to find $100,000 to replace his cows. He has got to get joined cows otherwise he is not going to get milk for the season. What do we offer him? We offered him a loan. The guy may already have a lot of loans. Nobody came along and said, `Can you afford the loan; can you get a cash income back?'. No. We just came along and said `Yeah. We will offer you a loan at 4 per cent'. Frankly, I find that a bit of a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again in the King Valley there is a case of a hop farmer. When hops grow, quite large posts are put up and the hops grow up them with trailing vines. It was a very good hop farm. All of the farm has gone. The topsoil has gone; it has just vanished. The farmer has got a clay base, where once he had hops growing on some of the best horticultural land in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to stress that this is damage that I have never seen before in my life. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) is right. I mention the landcare program and the need for us, as a federal government, to put in quite considerable funding to repair the damage. I point out that there are some farms in the area that used to have top horticultural land. The farmers are now looking at a metre or two metres of unproductive clay and silt sitting on top of their productive land. These are people who can no longer grow crops. They have got to get rid of the silt or turn it back over and get the land into productive value. We are not giving the sort of assistance that will enable these people to become cost effective and independent again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the recommendations we are making, as my colleague has mentioned, is for landcare funding. If I can stress anything to this House and to the government it is that we must get the land back into production and get more work done. We have areas where rivers have literally gone in different directions, where the banks have vanished. We now get these great masses. The best way to describe them is to say that they look like New Zealand rivers. It is unbelievable damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless we get landcare funding to start repairing this quite enormous environmental damage then I am quite fearful that many people in this area, frankly, will not survive. It is beyond the capacity of individual farmers to tackle the magnitude of the damage which has occurred to the environment. It is not just damage done to productive farmland but also to crown land and a host of other areas, and the government has a responsibility there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also join with other members in stressing that the social security department really has to have a good look at the way it operates in these areas. It is a nonsense to expect people in the immediate aftermath of a disaster like this to put their mind to going and seeking their entitlements through the social security department. It is inhuman and fundamentally wrong that when a person eventually goes to the department and puts in an application for the assistance to which they are unarguably entitled, and which the department does not deny their entitlement to, to then say to them, `I am sorry, you cannot have it backdated'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fundamental problem with the act. The act has to be looked at. We as a government have to make sure that the department has more flexibility in providing immediate cash outlays to people who are faced with this problem. I think also that LEAP and the jobskill program could be utilised very successfully here. They are all areas of fairly high unemployment. There are a large number of young people there who are quite anxious to start work. In fact, many of the unemployed there did work during the flood and many are working voluntarily on farms by assisting with fencing and other things like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we can utilise LEAP, get additional funding in for LEAP, and additional funding for jobskill, we can pick up many of the unemployed and get them working on landcare programs, on farm restoration works and on fencing, trying to get that land back into production again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) in his concerns for tobacco growers. They already have quite enough problems on their plate because of both state and federal government changes to the quota system on the import of tobacco leaf. I share with him the largest tobacco growing areas in Victoria. They are small holdings; very small holdings. They are farmers who know nothing else. They are often Italian. They know no other means of farming than cropping. They bought their farms on the basis that they had a quota off their farms going into a marketing board. Maybe the state was silly to allow this sort of farming to occur but nevertheless it is there, it is fixed into place and their farmland and their farms are valued on the basis of that quota and that marketing system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we change the quota system next year many of these people, frankly, are not going to survive. They already have this problem with the quota system changing and now we are not giving them sufficient relief to help them restructure and get back into other forms of agricultural production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also share the concern of the honourable member for Murray on the question of interest on loans. It really is a nonsense and yet I note the disaster agreement, which I have got a copy of, allows the states to add to the relief monies on cost or the cost of providing the money. I do not accept for a moment that it is going to cost four per cent of a loan to a farmer to provide that money. I really agree that there should be some arrangement where there should be no interest paid. What is the use of it, when they have already got debt on a farm, to get another debt and then charge interest on that debt? We are just basically saying to farmers that we do not really care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also accept that businesses are the big losers. The non-farm businesses are the major losers. They really get nothing and yet in Benalla businesses have written off their entire stock and they have had nothing given to them. I believe that is a very major problem. I regret that I have only got 10 minutes to speak and I note the yellow light is on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really think there is a need to look at this whole system and I am pleased that on both sides of the House that we have total agreement here.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)acknowledges the population drift from inland Australia to coastal and northern regions;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)should enunciate policy directed at stemming this flow; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)deplores the lack of empathy shown by this Government to the residents of regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The last release of the 1991 census figures and the last 12 years of quarterly interstate migration figures should send a chill down the spine of every Australian. There are two clear trends: the first is a continuing drift of population from the inland regions to the coast, and the second is a general migration northwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the first of these, there has been negative growth over the last five years in the Western District and in the Wimmera of Victoria, the far west of New South Wales and the south-west of Queensland. It is almost as disturbing to see that the Mallee and Gippsland of Victoria, the northern, north-western, central western Murrumbidgee and Murray areas of New South Wales, and the Darling Downs, Fitzroy, central west, Mackay, northern and north-west regions of Queensland are all growing at slower rates than the state averages. In other words, these areas are slipping behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally unnerving is the fact that for the last 50 quarters&mdash;I stress that this refers to the last 50 quarters, so it is not just a flash in the pan aberration&mdash;net migration figures from New South Wales and Victoria have been negative, whereas the recorded net migration gains to Queensland over the corresponding 50 quarters have been phenomenal, so much so that in the March quarter of this year 17,000 people net transferred to Queensland. If that trend continues, 1,000 people a week will be crossing the border. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth areas of the last five years are the Sunshine Coast, the Gold Coast, the Wide Bay-Burnett and the Cairns area of the state, with a spill over into the Richmond-Tweed area of New South Wales. While I concede that this northern push has elements of capital city migration in it, nevertheless the trend shows an unsettling disillusionment with life in many parts of Australia. I do not intend to dwell too heavily on this facet, other than to say that the trend was worse in the dying stages of the Kirner government in Victoria, the Bannon-Arnold government in South Australia, and was going the same way for nine of the last 10 quarters of the Dowding-Lawrence government of Western Australia. The trend shows that people are not insensitive to financial mismanagement, to public confidence and that they vote with their feet. Nevertheless, the more worrying trend is the slow denuding of Australia's inland and country regions. Years of struggle, government indifference and heavy indirect taxation on primary producers are taking a heavy toll, and this is reflected in the towns serving the inland areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a national scandal that 60 per cent of our population live in our five largest coastal cities. We celebrate the great Australian country and outback spirit in song, folklore, verse and literature, and yet the reality is that it is slowly diminishing. There has been a lot of rhetoric about decentralisation and regional development but little done about it. In fact, the uncaring side of government is, if anything, accelerating the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quote a few examples from my own state's initiatives. On 9 July this year the state government announced the closure of nearly one-third of Queensland's railway lines. As one might have expected, there was outrage throughout the state. I might be a cynical soul but I believe that there is great cause for cynicism. The transport minister over the previous year assured councils of these areas in writing that the lines would stay open. Then on 25 July, in the face of the outrage, the Premier announced a review task force but, before the task force could release its findings and to the great anger of those serving on it, articles appeared, leaked by one of the ministries, on 9 October saying which lines would close. On 15 November yet another set of lines was to stay open, to be mothballed, or to be given conditional continuance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit of a replay of the daylight saving debate in Queensland. The Premier was debating the pros of the case in the populous south-east Labor heartland while the Deputy Premier set out to woo the bush with the no case. At best, it was a two-bob each way exercise; at worst, it was a cynical manipulation, and so it was with the rail service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the federal dimension, albeit at arm's length, Australia Post has euphemistically changed the status of post offices. Some are APOs and others are licensed post offices. While only those with more than six staff will remain under the direct control of Australia Post, others will effectively have to franchise their services and survive on selling stamps and on other sales, providing mail services and post-office boxes, et cetera. If this is not sufficient to sustain them then, obviously, they will close or be tucked in the back of some store, a pale reflection of a once very proud service. In all this, the government walks away with clean hands while even the minimum requirements for communications in the country are not being met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I admire Telecom's technical achievements, its spirit of service could do with some finetuning. Many provincial centres the size of Bundaberg and Gladstone in my area do not even have a business centre. If this is the case in a provincial city, imagine how much more difficult it is accessing those few centres that do remain from country areas. This is in addition to the closure of the radio inspectors' offices of the Department of Transport and Communications, as my colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) highlighted earlier in the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DEET offices at places like Lismore have also been closed. Then there are the nitpicking Medicare rules which  say that something as simple as freezing a sunspot off a hand now has to be subjected to a pathology test. For many country people that will mean a trip to the doctor, pathology tests in Brisbane or a provincial city, and then another trip to the doctor. If it was a cost saving measure, what a farce it has become and what an impost it is on country people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government has closed no fewer than 25 courthouses in recent years. After they were closed the role of the clerk of the court had to be assessed. The government admitted that the decision was wrong and then it had to put in facilitators. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy was reduced by 900 employees, 174 of which were in the agricultural branch, many of them meat and stock inspectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two-man police stations were reduced to one-man stations and there is very little police presence in provincial and country areas at the weekends. I will not bore the House with the details of the Queensland Ambulance Service, because that could fill a whole debate. However, I will say that when I paid courtesy calls to ambulance centres during the campaign I did not find one happy centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which cries to heaven for vengeance was the expenditure by the state government of $45 million of trust funds raised by country ambulance committees. It can be imagined what that did to the morale of country communities. The list goes on like the litany of saints, sadly without any inspiring or religious dimensions. In all of this, the human face of government has been removed from a myriad of large and small country towns. It is about more than just the removal of a government office; it is about access, equity, facilitation and caring. It is little wonder that the challenge of isolation, be that relative or total, is becoming unattractive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can we arrest this? That could be the subject of a whole debate, but there are a number of principles, both at the human level and at the regional development level, that could be addressed. Some years ago, when the Queensland department of industry development had offices in Melbourne and Sydney, I asked what it was that attracted people to Queensland and to country areas. Was it the work force or the industrial land? The answer was no, it was the quality of life, culture and educational facilities. So that is one of the starting points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three initiatives currently under way: the IC inquiry; the Kelty task force; and, more recently, the regional and rural task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). What a pity that this task force was not a bipartisan committee of this House rather than just a political hack organisation. I hope, however, in fairness to that task force, that it will not mirror the former country task force, which was little more than a vehicle for the vilification of those who disagreed with Labor policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me outline the steps that need to occur. The quality and access of government facilitation must be improved. Greater emphasis needs to be given to educational and cultural activities. An employment generation focus and, above all, a commitment need to be delivered through a sense of ownership. Regions need to be devised based on the interdependence of a provincial city and its hinterland. Regional practitioner organisations, such as development boards, must be properly funded by state and federal governments. It is only through a sense of ownership of a mixture of government operations that programs will be implemented. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think everybody would acknowledge that population drift is nothing new; it is very much a fact of life in Australia. As we know Australia today, it has been developed by people from different societies who have moved to Australia for a range of reasons. Population drift has been going on continuously and is something that we have become accustomed to. People move to different areas for different reasons. Many people are forced to move because of their particular economic circumstances; they see opportunities elsewhere and they move to where the economy is generating these opportunities. Of course, many of our ancestors were forced to come here for no other reason than that perhaps they lived in very deprived circumstances and were perceived to have broken the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is mostly economic opportunity that creates the climate for people to move. In the early days it was land or gold that moved people to various regions of Australia. Today we have a totally different economy and different reasons for people to move. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) talked about the drift from the inland to the coastal areas. With an economy such as we have at present in which tourism is our greatest growth industry, it is natural that people are going to move to where the opportunities are. They will be moving north to Queensland, because the tourism industry is taking full advantage of the Queensland climate and it is only natural that people will drift to where the opportunities are occurring. On many a day in Victoria, when we look out and it is a bit cloudy and rainy, we might wish that we had the climate that Queensland has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the fact that people are moving is of major concern. It would be a major concern if those moves are not regulated as well as they could be by government or if some country communities are having difficulties because of the shift of population and are not getting the support they need. We certainly recognise that and the economics of what is happening in Australia today. If small country towns lose a  major industry, or even if they lose the school and the people from it, it might not be very long before the doctor or the chemist follows suit and then the people do not have the necessary services. There is a limit to how much subsidy can be put into certain regions and we must continue to allow economic forces to dictate to a certain degree where people wish to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also says we should enunciate policies directed at stemming the flow. I think the National Party for many, many years, when it was a partner in the coalition, used the power of numbers it had to persuade many Liberals to provide subsidies in order to facilitate the stemming of the flow, or to direct people to particular parts of Australia. That era is over, and I am sure the honourable member for Hinkler would recognise that, because behind those tariff walls we developed an economy which lasted us for about 25 years and then it ran right into a big brick wall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have to become part of a world economy and we have to develop the policies which relate to that. That is certainly occurring at the moment, and it is also part of why we have the drift of people. But you cannot stem the tide. There is no way in the world that bureaucrats and governments can make decisions expecting to stem the tide of change, because it will continue regardless of what governments try to do, particularly in an economic sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen some dreadful decisions made in the past in trying to adjust the economy and stem the tide&mdash;as the National Party people like to call it&mdash;by creating subsidised operations which have had detrimental effects not only eventually to the communities but also to the whole nation, when we have had to restructure the whole show. People do suffer then because the restructuring comes much faster than expected after the natural progression of change has been held up for five, 10 or even 15 years. When it does hit, such change hits regions very hard, as I know from the restructuring that is going on now in my electorate of McMillan, where behind very safe tariff walls we had industries and state electricity operations which were very fat and very soft and did not have to compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today it is totally different, and I know there are people from my area moving to Queensland and good luck to them, I say. If they can move to Queensland and find opportunities, in the long term, of course, it will be good for those families but it is a very difficult phase for anybody to go through. So we cannot expect to stem the tide. We have to realise that the opportunities are in other parts of Australia at the present time and we must assist those people as best we can to make the right economic decisions for their families and for their futures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hinkler deplores the lack of empathy shown by the government to the residents of regional and rural Australia. I would say that the dead opposite is the case. Those who do not face up to reality, of course, cause the problem. As one might expect, the Australian people make their decisions at election times and call upon those who have the policies that they see will rectify the problem. So it is obvious that the people of Australia since 1983 have considered that the policies put forward by Labor governments will best serve this nation and their best interests, in contrast to our coalition opponents who have had their go for a long time and created a lot of the problems in Australia. I think it is probably an overstatement by the honourable member for Hinkler to declare that there is a lack of empathy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that today the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) will be making an announcement in relation to rural health. A large national health unit is to be established in my electorate of McMillan, which will be the centre of a major program to encourage and to develop programs to bring the health services of Australia in the modern era to rural Australia. That unit will be working in with the Monash-Gippsland university, with other universities around Australia and with remote areas of Australia as far away as Alice Springs. It is proposed that that health unit will bring to Australians the sort of delivery that is required to have health workers who are prepared to be trained and to work in country and regional areas. It will be a major initiative to assist rural Australia and one that demonstrates that this government certainly does look at those sorts of policies and develop them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The restructuring over the years has been designed to lift off that veil of inefficiency and to develop an economy which faces and moves out into the national and international scene. We recognise the ongoing need for policy development, and we are doing that through studies, as has been mentioned. The Kelty task force has been moving all over Australia in relation to these issues. It has just been announced in the last week that the McInsey organisation will be doing extensive studies in four or five concentrated regions of Australia in order to further develop policy. The Industry Commission is also working on those issues. To say that there is lack of empathy is ridiculous because, whilst we recognise now that changes are taking place, there is further work to be done and we are expecting that a lot of effort is going to be put in in the next six months at the Public Service level, the government level and the community level in order to further develop policies which recognise that Australia has to develop its natural resources without subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the preceding occupant of the chair, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), the mover of this motion, represents an area which has Gladstone and power stations, while I represent the Latrobe Valley. One of the major issues in Australia is the need to look at those natural resources and how to use them effectively, because our competitors around the world are also moving in those directions. There is no point in building a Victorian power station ever again where the intention is to transmit its power hundreds of miles to a smelter while expecting to compete in other parts of the world in the production of aluminium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hinkler, of course, has a major advantage. He has a power station and a port; he has everything on the spot. So if there is a place in Australia where that sort of development should take place, the honourable member's electorate is probably one of the best situated for the development of natural resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just hope that the honourable member does not make the same mistakes as the National Party did in the past and that his colleagues do not decide to shift things away from where the natural resources are, as they have done in Victoria. The Victorian taxpayers have now coughed up something like $1,000 million over 10 years to try to subsidise a program to build a smelter hundreds of miles from a power station. This was done for political purposes, and not for good, sound economic reasons.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a concept does not do the community any good; it does not do the local communities any good and it is a thing of the past. If honourable members opposite ever want to get re-elected, they need to wake up to the fact that the Australian people no longer believe in the airy-fairy idea that they are going to get any benefits in the long term from subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government has a great record in this area of development of regional Australia, and it will continue. There will be moves. We do not disagree that there will be population shift, but we must do it correctly. When the population does move, we must provide acceptable services to towns in regional Australia over the periods when they are having difficulty&mdash;services the same as those expected in the cities of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to second the motion of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) in regard to population drift from the inland of Australia to our coastal regions and to the major metropolitan areas. I represent the electorate of Riverina, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and this drift is something that I am very alarmed about. Of course, before that I represented the seat of Riverina-Darling, which extended from the South Australian border up to the Queensland border.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It often amazes me that we have a continent that it takes about three or four days to drive across, yet most Australians live in urban or semi-urban environments within 200 kilometres of the eastern coast or in the south-west corner of Western Australia, taking up much of the good rural lands of Australia. In June 1990 it was found that 71 per cent of Australia's population lived in the state and territory capitals, plus six other large cities of 100,000 people or more. In fact, I think about 85 to 90 per cent of Australians are urbanised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of that has been that many smaller communities in rural Australia have started to fall apart. When one goes into those areas, there is nothing more melancholy than a shuttered-up building, whether it be a business or a private residence. The trouble has been that governments, both state and federal, really have given no incentive for this to stop. There are no policies to keep people in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) this morning saying we had to get into manufacturing, that Australia would be recognised for its manufacturing now as we get away from the farm and from the mine, but I would like to remind the Prime Minister that 64 per cent of our overseas trade is still based on mining and farming. Where do we find most of these miners and where do we find most of these farmers? In rural areas. While ever we have the ACTU ruling the roost, particularly with the new industrial relations legislation, there is no way that people, particularly in rural areas, are going to employ workers in the manufacturing sector if they do not have to. From my reading and from talking to people in my electorate, one would have to be a masochist to employ someone under those conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just recently the government has set up a regional task force that Mr Kelty is running. He is the secretary of the ACTU. He has been around to my electorate, and on the face of it the task force looks pretty good. I asked Mr Kelty whether he and his committee would come to Leeton because of the Letona cannery problem. I understand they are very busy and cannot get there at this time. Perhaps they may get there at another time. At the bottom, the reply says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This meeting was organised by the respective regional development organisations and the issue of future job creation in the region including the food processing industry were canvassed.</PARA>
<PARA>The Letona cannery does have jobs which will be lost, and it is no good talking about job creation when jobs are going to be lost. It just seems to be a waste of time to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In setting up this committee, the government really is being a little bit hypocritical, having increased excise on fuel. That one step alone has disadvantaged everyone living in rural Australia. It is a disadvantage to all Australia, of course, but mainly to those in rural areas. That one step alone has put back decentralisation by years and years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that we have had a drastic reduction in expenditure on roads. In some areas of rural Australia the roads are the only links because rail systems are being removed. Mining and farming areas need support. They need roads; they need rail; they need hospitals; they need banks&mdash;all these things that are gradually being put under threat in the drift of population towards the coast and to the major metropolitan areas. Governments need policies that will move people out of the major metropolitan areas into the country. Moving part of the CSIRO to Wagga was investigated but, because of one thing or another, the people would not go to Wagga. They are areas where governments can help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot afford to allow major metropolitan areas to continue to grow, mainly because of pollution, because of the quality of life. I do not have time to go into detail but Sydney, for example, will have to spend $10 billion on replacing sewerage infrastructure over the next 18 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Possibly the major factor in the social, economic and environmental life of Australia is the transport system. This is true of all industrialised countries but particularly Australia, given the country's huge size and low population density. Transport determines land use, the shape, size and density of urban areas, the types of dwellings we live in, the location of jobs, the levels of air and noise pollution, accident levels, patterns of rural development, the price of goods and the competitiveness of exports. It affects the efficiency of the whole economy and the social interaction and the wellbeing of virtually everyone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been numerous reports, seminars, announcements and legislative changes by state and federal governments over the last 25 years about the costs of urban sprawl and the need for high housing densities to reduce this sprawl, but all to no avail. Sprawl has continued unabated because the solution that it proposes is virtually unrelated to the problem. The overwhelming determinant is the transport system and as the system has moved to a largely private car based system then lower urban densities have been generated. There has been no land use policy related to transport and no mechanism to implement such policies even if they existed at either state or federal level of government. City motorists suffer extreme congestion and parking difficulties. Public transport services cover only a minority of urban areas and are generally regarded as unreliable, congested and often unsafe, and the urban environment steadily deteriorates. </PARA>

We almost seem to have reverted to late 19th century England where the mix of huge road going steam buses and small vehicles and an inadequate road system produced an horrendous accident rate. This eventually led to the Red Flag Act and a speed limit of four miles per hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales government seems to have almost abandoned any form of transport policy and in recent years has simply thrown the issue open and advertises, asking if anyone out there has any proposals. Local government, as a reaction to the many traffic problems, is spending millions of dollars handing out placebos to their residents, building all manner of hoops and jumps in a forlorn attempt to solve the problems of ever increasing traffic. The causes of all this anarchy and dissatisfaction are many but the fundamental cause is the lack of any relationship of cost to usage in the transport system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present transport system is a result of subsidy upon subsidy and distortion upon distortion. Transport infrastructure has been used as a means of job creation, welfare distribution and vote buying as are many road projects. When the New South Wales government decided some 30 years ago to introduce a subsidised school transport scheme, it cost a mere $3 million per annum. Today it is costing over $300 million per annum. In other words, the cost of it would build 20 new high schools per year. It has distorted school choice and is responsible for enormous peak hour traffic generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the lower North Shore of Sydney almost 50 per cent of the total peak hour traffic is related to education facilities. We have never resolved the need for a national transport policy and standards with our federal system of government. Whilst gains have been made in recent years the ports of Australia are, for example, to some extent museums to this failure, as is much of the railway infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an historical fact that roads have generally been free to the user in spite of their enormous costs. For example, the Gore Hill freeway in Sydney cost $43 million per kilometre for construction alone. It provides magnificent luxury off-peak travel for a handful of the Australian population. If people want a better road the procedure has been to organise a lobby effectively and they will get one at no direct cost to themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no effective mechanisms to determine funding between proposals, be they urban, rural or regional. Road funding has been largely by grants, and railways largely by loans, totally distorting the modal split of road versus rail. Even private toll roads generally receive massive subsidies by way of grants, loans and free land, with toll charges purely arbitrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent trend of building private toll roads also promises even more anarchy and traffic congestion in the future. Private toll roads create special interests whose economic wellbeing depends on high levels of traffic congestion. It will be in their interests to oppose strongly any proposal to reduce over-dependence on cars or to reduce congestion. Therefore, they can be expected to oppose any expenditure on public transport or any attempts by government to provide rational road pricing policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government economic policies relating to private cars generally promote over-dependence. Capital charges by federal and state governments mean that usage costs are relatively minor, hence distorting people's decision making. It would be much less distorting to eliminate sales tax altogether, for example, and replace it with a revenue neutral fuel tax of approximately 4c a litre. This would dramatically reduce the age of Australia's car fleet, create jobs, provide safer and less polluting vehicles and allow us to move towards relating cost to use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In rural areas, use is primarily related to fuel charges but in urban areas parking is the major determinant. Here again, most urban parking is heavily subsidised one way or the other. Retail organisations spread parking costs over all consumers, thereby transferring the subsidy from those who use public transport or walk to the shops to car users. Local state and federal employers often provide heavily subsidised parking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government massively subsidises parking stations, almost always ignoring land costs, therefore creating a transfer of funds to motorists from non-car owners. A constructed parking space in the inner and middle areas of Sydney costs, for example, in the order of $20,000 to $30,000, including land. Australian cities now have about 30 per cent of their total land given over to roads and parking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many studies have shown the hidden cross-subsidies between classes of road users, with overwhelming evidence that private cars heavily subsidise buses and trucks. The construction of new highways, with 450 millimetre deep concrete heavily reinforced, let alone the rapidly rising road maintenance costs, gives some indication of the extent of heavy vehicle subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these distortions and subsidies in turn affect sea and air transport in relation to land transport. These modes have many distortions and subsidies of their own. For example, in relation to Sydney airport, the costs of airport development pale into insignificance alongside the wider urban consolidation and environmental costs of the airport on the metropolitan area. However, these costs are not passed on to airline users or the airline industry, who thereby benefit from a huge subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this chaos will continue until governments and the public accept the principles that transport decisions must be made on a full cost-recovery basis and that all charges should relate to user benefits. That is not to say that subsidies should not be provided, but they must always be transparent and, preferably, given directly to recipients without distorting the transport function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one pretends that road pricing is easy. Countless reports the world over on road cost recovery and user charges show the difficulties. Nevertheless, a consensus is emerging that shows that light vehicles subsidise heavy vehicles and that rail and sea transport would substantially improve their economic position with even reasonable road cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is not helped by motoring interests which endlessly mislead the public by claiming that the motorists are excessively taxed. These claims are usually made by comparing levels of mainly fuel taxation and state charges to annual expenditure on road construction and maintenance. However, construction and maintenance are only the tip of the iceberg. When the costs of road accidents, hospital costs, 30 per cent of the national health system, noise and air pollution, policing and legal costs, environmental costs, distortions of land use and many other factors are considered, there is no doubt that petrol is hugely underpriced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these costs are again difficult to quantify but, both here and overseas, studies show that petrol needs to cost well over $2 a litre to approach full cost recovery. Nevertheless, the present situation of having the cheapest petrol in the world with one of the longest road systems and the least number of vehicles to pay for it, means that the road system will continue to be hopelessly inadequate. We will continue to have dinosaur car engines made here which cannot be exported, accelerating urban sprawl, among the world's highest consumption of oil, and a worsening balance of payments with increasing fuel imports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, let me say that I have an interest in this matter in that I am a member of the Fitzroy football club. I am a donor and a sponsor of that club. My grievance is against the way the game of Australian football is being managed by people who want to take it away from those who own it, the ordinary men and women and children of Victoria and Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian rules football is an industry worth about $2 billion a year. It is not just a game; it is big business. But, of course, that business is not owned by the commercial people who now want to take over control of the game. As I stress, it is a game which is owned by ordinary men, women and children, by ordinary families who put money into it. It has been hijacked. No longer do ordinary club members&mdash;those who go on a Saturday in Melbourne or other states, who stand in the rain, eat a pie and sauce, drink a tinny, follow their team and enjoy themselves&mdash;have control, or rights of control, over this great game. The hijacking is complete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About a year or two years ago, the AFL decided it would get rid of the Footscray football club. It tried very hard to get rid of the Footscray football club and it failed. More recently, it tried to get rid of the Fitzroy football club and, at this stage, it has failed. It is also trying to get rid of the Richmond football club and the North Melbourne football club. Of course Hawthorn, the premier club of Victoria, is also in financial difficulty. Hawthorn must now be on the chopping block. The AFL wants to run a commercial business with a game which is owned by ordinary people. It is time this was stopped; it is time that football was returned to the people who own it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the sorts of people who have taken over football in the last decade&mdash;people such as Dr Edelsten, Bob Ansett, Lindsay Fox, Alan Bond, Christopher Skase and, dare I mention the name, John Elliott&mdash;before I get accused of blackmailing or attacking the Labor Party, which I am not. These are the sorts of people who have moved into and have taken over the grand old clubs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went to my first game of Australian rules football when I was so young that I do not even recall how old I was. It was at the Brunswick Street football oval, the original old Fitzroy football club home. It was a great thrill for a kid to go with his dad and watch his local heroes. I recall that I used to eat dim sims in those days. They were heroes; they are heroes to many kids today. Yet this joy of youth is being taken away from them because of the commercialisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AFL is actually a private company; it is the Australian Football League Ltd. It is a company which is limited by guarantee. It is, theoretically, owned by the 15 clubs which now constitute the AFL; it is managed by a person called Ross Oakley. Oakley is so concerned about football that he rips off a salary of $400,000 a year. The late Alan Schwab was paid $300,000 a year. This is $700,000 of public money. This is money quite often put in by low income people and it is being ripped off by those who now administer this great game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, another example is Sydney where, quite foolishly in my view, Victorian people have tried to introduce a game alien to the state. It is a state which has always had a very low spectator base. The former South Melbourne club, now called Sydney, is in such a financial mess that it is being subsidised by Victorian football goers. I am led to believe that the present manager/coach, Ron Barassi, is being paid a salary package in excess of $300,000 a year. Close to $1 million is being paid out on just three people involved in this game, for their own self-interest, I would suspect, against the wishes of the vast majority of football supporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even worse than that, more recently&mdash;and this is where my real grievance comes into it&mdash;the AFL, without notifying clubs of potential rule changes on the transfer of players, did a deal with the Brisbane football club so that one of Fitzroy's best players, Alastair Lynch, could negotiate a deal with Brisbane without having to tell his own club. After the deal was made, the AFL announced the rule changes so that Fitzroy lost Alastair Lynch on a package which is publicly reported to be $1.2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what we call a sport in this country. There are an awful lot of clubs that are not in a position today to compete with paying a single player a contract package of $1.2 million. Alistair Lynch is one of the best footballers I have seen in my life; he is very skilful and a great footballer. But I worry about which direction the game is going when the controller of the game, the AFL, does a deal under the counter with Brisbane to try to boost Brisbane's capacity to take top players from clubs that are struggling in Victoria and then allows that to happen legally down the track. It stinks, quite frankly, and it does nothing whatsoever for football. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even worse than that, in order to get rid of clubs, the Australian Football League has done a deal whereby when a team like Fitzroy travels to play a club such as Adelaide, which has an enormous support base&mdash;it has a membership of around 38,000&mdash;the Adelaide members who attend on membership tickets make no contribution towards the central funding; none at all. So Fitzroy goes over there and Fitzroy does not get one penny of the gate receipts, not a penny, whereas, when Adelaide comes across and plays Fitzroy in Melbourne, it gets a share of the gate receipts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One sits back and watches the way this game is being administered and one says, `I am an owner of the game. I am just an ordinary bloke out there in the streets and me and my kids go on a regular basis', yet what I believe about the game, and what most Australian football supporters believe about the game, is that we are totally cut out from it. Why should these other owners of the game, as I call them, have the privilege at a home and home game of sitting in plush surroundings behind glass? I have been to some of these lunches the owners of the game now have, with starched tablecloths, silver service and waiter service. They sit back before the game starts with an excellent three-course meal and top wines. They sit up there in their plush facilities paid for by ordinary families, have these great lunches and then sit behind glass and enjoy the game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They do not pay for their lunches&mdash;not at all. It comes out of the money which ordinary people put into the gate down below while these people sit up in their new facilities, with their three-course meals on tablecloth and with silver service, and look down at the poor people below who stand out in the rain and enjoy the game. They look down at them and they do not understand that they are the people who pay for these privileges. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, said only last week, `Let Fitzroy go'. It is a nonsense, because if Fitzroy goes, North Melbourne goes, Richmond will go and Hawthorn is at risk. It is not just one club. The AFL is trying to make this game a commercial game owned by people, a purely profit seeking game, when it is a game which I own, we all own, and we should be worried about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to grieve today on behalf of rural and regional Australia and its growing estrangement from urban Australia. Canberra is the centre of the nation's national government and therefore it is well worth examining what attitudes and values pervade the place that has such an influence on the daily lives of my constituents. It has to be said that Canberra is an increasingly remote place. It is increasingly a world of its own with very few links and very little dialogue with mainstream society, especially the distinctive world of the countryside. It is little wonder Canberra's decision makers have next to no grasp of the needs of rural regions. The decision makers have hardly been scratched by the recession and the latest budget, with its huge increases in fuel and other taxes, only serves to strip away more resources from the countryside to bolster Canberrans' living standards. Canberrans and the Public Service mandarins who inhabit the place and dominate its social life and culture enjoy services and facilities rural Australians could only dream about, and the federal government is driving open the gulf wider and wider every year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs of running the Public Service have jumped by  six per cent this year, a year in which the rest of us have been lectured by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) about the importance of having to pay extra taxes to wind back the public debt. We see with our own eyes new Public Service buildings springing up around the place after Labor's election win. If the rural sector could just lay its hands on a small proportion of this largess, it could solve a lot of basic problems in the bush. But years into the rural crisis we are still fighting the same issues, working out how to improve the lot of the farm sector and rural business, and how to defend and preserve the interests of the rural community against forces which are diminishing its standing, its resources base and, more importantly, its morale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not pretend these are easy times for any people in the community, be they metropolitan or rural dwellers. I do not want anyone to think that governments can achieve miracles. Forgetting Canberra for the time, I do not believe we can invent some fantasy world where every rural community will be flush with services and never have need again. We are dealing with the real world. We have to do the best we can and keep alive our hopes that we can always do a little better if we work harder in the bush. That, after all, is what we are about in country areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message we have to get across to the nation and to the various governments of the day is that the countryside is unique. It is something altogether different from Canberra, from Sydney's sprawling west or from Melbourne's eastern suburbs, which all seem to dictate the political and policy debate. In rural electorates like Gippsland, 42 per cent of households earn an average annual salary of $25,000 or under, compared with a Victorian state-wide average of 24 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party seats, the prime rural areas of the nation, have populations amongst the poorest in Australia. In fact, the poorest 14 electorates in Australia, out of a total of 147, are all rural or regional. The federal seats of Mallee and Murray in Victoria, for instance, are among the seats that have the highest proportion of families on low incomes. Mallee has over 23 per cent of its families earning less than $16,000; Murray has over 21 per cent. Those percentages are approaching twice the national average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members are interested in looking at the nation's priorities, let us compare these figures with those for Canberra, the seat of decision making. While about only six per cent of Canberra's families have incomes under $16,000, the average figure for rural Victoria is 20 per cent. Canberra residents have average annual incomes of well over $50,000; rural Victorians on average earn around $22,000 less per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Canberra also has one of the highest growth rates in Australia with its population surging by 23 per cent between 1986 and 1991, but rural seats such as Wannon in western Victoria, Mallee, and McMillan in central Gippsland have growth rates of minus 1.4 per cent, 1.5 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively. Bendigo and Ballarat have average growth rates of around seven per cent only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One-third of all families in the national capital have yearly incomes above $60,000 but the average for rural Victorian seats is less than 10 per cent. Enough is enough! Somewhere, something has gone terribly wrong and, if country people think we have a problem getting the message through to Canberra, then maybe here is the reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must also understand that economic recovery, generally speaking, will be slower in rural regions than elsewhere. In view of the very limited commercial infrastructure in rural regions and its heavy dependence on commodity prices, the regional economy cannot expect a rapid return to health. This is a very different situation to the situation that the cities face with their wider and deeper commercial infrastructure. Cities have a vastly bigger pool of demand and may, in the future, recover quicker. We cannot and Victoria's rural areas are dealing with an altogether different labour market problem as well, in common with Australia's country areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average rise in unemployment across rural regions was just under two per cent between March 1992 and March 1993, but two-thirds of Victoria's 30 local government areas, the vast bulk of them rural, had an average rise of 4.6 per cent. Many rural areas are therefore still in an unemployment free fall and a huge slice of those who are jobless face a very long term of unemployment or else they will just drift off into the cities, further weakening the countryside's economic base in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we face this massive labour market and demographic problem, let us look at what is happening in Canberra. A week ago the federal government proposed that unemployed artists be paid jobsearch subsidies and allowances for up to two years without any work tests whatsoever. The plan makes a mockery of efforts to help the rural unemployed. There are 4,500 farmers on jobsearch allowances. Of these, 25 per cent, or 1,000 to 1,100, are located in Victoria. They are being forced to seek off-farm work and forgo re-establishment grants under the rural adjustment scheme just to qualify for benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural community fought tooth and nail to have unemployment allowances extended to the farm sector and now the government is giving them as a handout to city based artists. The sight of unemployed artists receiving the dole while free to pursue their own artistic interests is too much to swallow, but it is a sight like this that we have to get used to. We will have to get used to a few other things Canberra is cooking up as well in the future at the expense of the rural community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have presented a pretty despairing picture of life in rural Australia. We do face more challenges on more fronts than I can remember before. That is no cause for throwing in the towel; far from it. This is where rural communities come into their own. This is where the National Party and farm organisations come into their own and face the test for their right to exist and claim leadership of the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The communities and towns we represent have been through two world wars, droughts, depressions and every other challenge one can imagine, and they have survived. Every year brings fresh challenges to country towns and cities right across Australia but all rural communities have learned to fight back all the harder. Their self-help ethic, their sense of civic responsibility and the ever-present optimism of their community leaders are great prizes and they will ensure rural Australia forges on towards the 21st century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we ever needed reminding of where the great strength we have to have to keep pushing on against the tide comes from, we probably saw it all before our very eyes earlier this month when the Unknown Soldier returned after 75 years to be buried in his own soil in the Hall of Memory in the Australian War Memorial. We do not listen to what is being said about how we are all meant to be working to manufacture a new identity or whatever. We have got it all, symbolised in the one unnamed man entombed in marble. When it comes time, as it sometimes does for many in rural areas, to wonder whether the race is worth the candle and whether to battle to hold on against those who do not care or who do not understand that it is worth it, then there is a simple and timeless reason why we keep pushing on. The rural community may be hard pressed but it represents the traditional core of Australia at a time when tradition is ridiculed. It hangs on and it will hang on a good bit longer than those people and special interests which have currently turned their backs on the countryside. </PARA>

<PARA>Innovation encompasses all those activities necessary to produce commercial products and processes: that is, technology, development, design, quality, marketing and sales, training, management and so on. Innovation is critical to economic growth. It is only through firms understanding their customer demands better and developing an ability to respond quickly and accurately to those demands that sustained competitive success will be assured for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's scientific and technological capabilities are among its greatest resources. I note that, since the Nobel prize was instituted, Australia has had three Nobel winners in the sciences, and that the east Asian countries, vastly larger in population, have produced only six Nobel winners in the sciences. Obviously, the skills of Australian scientists and technologists do not translate into innovation unless they are applied in a commercial context. For too long, we Australians have accepted the European model of innovation. In this model, pure research&mdash;mostly funded by government&mdash;is developed by applied researchers and is commercialised in industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal government programs now reflect a new approach to innovation that takes account of the economic success of Japan and certain east Asian countries. The speed and cost effectiveness of the innovation processes adopted by these countries have been a major factor in their economic growth. Under the so-called Asian model of innovation, the identification of commercial opportunities leads technologists to set research requirements which define the necessary R&amp;D programs; that is, the commercial opportunities determine the R&amp;D, and not the other way around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reflecting this approach, the federal government has pursued a number of strategies, including programs such as the partnerships for development program for information industries and the factor F program that supports the pharmaceutical industry. These programs have put Australian researchers in direct contact with leading companies such as IBM and the pharmaceutical company Merck, Sharp and Dohme. These programs have helped Australian researchers direct their work to meet the needs of major world markets, and the programs have been essential for the success of leading Australian companies such as the Computer Power group and Amrad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A notable characteristic of Japan and other east Asian nations is that they have placed innovation and research and development to the forefront of their national priorities. Indeed, they have been able to reach, within their own countries, basic agreement by their political parties on their country's policy formulation and the direction of innovation and R&amp;D. That is not so in Australia. Honourable members will recall Fightback, the document that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) rightly described as `a 700-page suicide note'. To the consternation of his colleagues, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) still stands by Fightback, without the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback says nothing about the role of innovation in generating economic growth. Fightback proposed funding cuts that would cause terrible damage to industrial innovation in Australia. These cuts would include a $50 million per annum cut to tax revenue forgone through the 150 per cent tax incentive. In effect, Fightback proposes tightening the eligibility criteria for the concession.

An Australian firm, Interscan, has signed a contract in excess of $5 million to supply its premier product, the microwave landing system, to the government of Taiwan.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak here today on behalf of many parents in the Pearce electorate, and I am certain that I speak on behalf of many parents in Australia, who have voiced their grave concerns at a social security measure that they see as a threat to the integrity of their families. The measure is the youth homeless allowance. On the evidence, they are right to be concerned. The government has a duty to act. The youth homeless allowance stands as a warning on how a well-intentioned palliative can itself become a cause rather than a remedy of social dislocation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was argued that homeless young people should receive an allowance from the taxpayer rather than turn to crime and prostitution. The consequence, however, has been to make homelessness a superficially attractive option for children and to some parents. The human dimension is too easily forgotten. This should have been foreseen and, in fact, was foreseen by the former member for Richmond in May 1986 when the first amendments were made to the Social Security Act to make available the youth homeless allowance. However, it should have been foreseen by many others that a 15-year-old receiving $102 a week and living independently would consider that he or she has gained adult status and be the envy of many of his or her peers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any parent would know that adolescents can and do rebel. This is a natural part of the road to adulthood and coping with it is a natural part of parenting. The last thing that so many families need during this process is a taxpayer funded incentive for a child to leave home prematurely. For every child who does leave home, there are many others who threaten to do so and, in the minds of their parents, now have the means to make good their threat. Welfare benefits were never intended to erode family cohesion and the basis of discipline without which we cannot become self-respecting adults. It is particularly important that, as young adults, we learn that with rights come responsibilities and with freedom comes discipline. Social welfare payments were never intended to allow parents to abandon difficult adolescents by throwing them out of the home, in the knowledge that the state will pick up the tab. When this happens, the state, of course, must take action but resources would be better deployed to try to prevent such family breakdowns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make this speech today with concern for the officers of the Department of Social Security who must administer this policy. I have been assured that a great many applications for the allowance are refused, particularly in cases where young applicants refuse to allow contact to be made with their parents, or where children simply do not want to obey the house rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is too much anecdotal evidence, however, that indicates that, of the tenfold increase of 10,000 children receiving the allowance, many come from homes where there is no real abuse and where parents want to provide for them. The actual numbers of young people applying for this and the cost to the country were also foreshadowed somewhat by the former member for Richmond in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On evidence, the worst aspect of the administration of the allowance is the right to privacy. This is a sensitive area where children ought not automatically be given the same rights as adults. Although an independent adult authority is supposed to be contacted when a child demands that his or her parents not be informed of that child's application for this allowance, this does not seem to be a fail-safe process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right to privacy can be the right to tell lies that cannot be refuted. If it is exercised, however, because of real abuse in the family home, then it is equally wrong that the DSS officers are prevented from contacting state police and welfare officers. The system, in effect, allows for crime to evade investigation. Has anyone stopped to consider that, if a 15-year-old is fleeing a home where abuse is occurring, then other children may remain there and be subjected to the same abuse? The social workers from the department are only able to establish whether a child is homeless. They have no brief to interact with state authorities or to initiate family reconciliation. Counselling can be an abused word but it is terribly necessary to assist those families where there are genuine problems but equally genuine possibilities for solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have become a warped society if we think it acceptable that children as young</PARA>
<PARA>as 12 are paid $102 a week to live independently, if parents who wish to provide for their children have their role usurped by the state, if other parents are encouraged to abandon responsibility, and if government agencies promote the concept of premature adulthood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is becoming clear that many responsible people in the department know that the system needs tightening up, and we had in October an admission from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) that a review was being undertaken to make the granting of the allowance more stringent. This, however, is too important a matter to be left to an in-house inquiry. A review must talk with state welfare bodies, with youth workers and with parents, who should be given the opportunity to state how the granting of the allowance has damaged their families and the welfare of their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the International Year of the Family, Australia should respond by making a fresh start in the validation of the family and directing greater policy emphasis toward prevention of family breakdown rather than the repair of its consequences. This task involves a new approach to taxation as well as to welfare policy. More resources need to be allocated to lessen the number of family breakdowns and sole parenting. Dysfunctional families do not always need welfare payments but they do need education and they do need counselling. Sir Robert Menzies said 50 years ago that the family was the foundation of sanity and sobriety. His words are even more relevant to our current uncertain times, since it is by sharing and commitment within the family that we learn to relate to the wider community. It is a great loss for any young Australian to be deprived of the opportunity to develop as an individual within a forgiving environment. The future of Australia depends on skills learnt primarily within the family to solve problems, to promote harmony and to reconcile viewpoints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seven out of 10 Australians say that family life is the source of their greatest satisfaction. Unfortunately, sentiment is not always matched with commitment, when we have 300,000 single-parent families caring for 500,000 children depending on sole-parent pensions. The case for the importance of a strong family unit could rest on the economic argument alone. In a practical sense, the problem is that two-parent families have had a sevenfold increase in relative taxation since the 1950s with less benefits. Then, total tax on average weekly earnings was less than 10 per cent; now it is 23 per cent. There is a shrinking pool of two-parent families carrying an increasing burden. Of far greater importance is the human heartbreak and the social dislocation of a growing number of children and adults who no longer have the safety nets, the role models and the support of a cohesive family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we move toward the International Year of the Family in 1994, the evidence is abundant that this legislation does nothing to elevate the role of the family in our communities. Sadly, there are young people in our midst who need the kind of assistance this legislation provides. The government, though, must now act swiftly to reform the youth homeless allowance. A shift of emphasis is also needed to provide the necessary support to prevent family breakdown rather than reacting to a problem that has become the cause of great pressure on the family. This was made very clear also by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) when he addressed this legislation on 1 May 1986. He said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I too rise to support families because as a member of this House I am very concerned about some recent statements by a member of the Senate, Senator Julian McGauran, who I think has abrogated responsibility to families and to children with some of his statements. I think it is fair to say that I am ashamed that a member of the Senate in recent days has behaved as irresponsibly as Senator McGauran has. He has behaved like a Scrooge with cheap politicking that could well spoil Christmas for many children in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our society there is nothing more precious than the innocent joy of celebration of Christmas with children. The giving of gifts, the singing of carols and the gathering of families at Christmas are a very important part of a child's upbringing. I believe that Christmas should be above petty, cheap and dirty politics and I believe that in recent days Senator McGauran has spoilt Christmas for thousands of Australian children. As a member of this House, I am ashamed that Senator McGauran could play politics with the joy of Christmas experienced by so many children. I think it is fairly obvious that Senator McGauran has never been to a kindergarten and probably has never visited one in his public life. If he visited kindies and preschools in my electorate, he would find a high quality of care and centres that operate on basic values of decency and honesty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent guidelines, produced by the Commonwealth government with the support of the child-care industry and now adopted by the federal government, reflect the values of decency and honesty. Senator McGauran has set out on a deliberate campaign of lies to frighten people and to spoil Christmas for kids. I would like to quote from the guidelines mentioned by Senator McGauran. Principle 25 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experiences provided by the program should cover a wide variety of areas including music, art, movement, literature, drama and the natural environment, as well as many types of play such as water play, block play, woodwork, pretend play, food preparation and sand play.</PARA>
<PARA>Is Senator McGauran opposed to this guideline? Does he want kids to be locked up all day in a child-care centre watching television? Of course he should not. The fact of the matter is that the guidelines simply outline a very sensible and diversified program for the education and upbringing of our children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at a number of the guidelines we find no reference to the allegations made by Senator McGauran. Senator McGauran has alleged, for example, that boys will not be allowed to play with trucks and that Christmas carols will be banned. If Senator McGauran were to visit many of the centres in my electorate he would find children at kindy singing songs like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Little Red Wagon</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Wheels on the Bus</EMPHASIS> and so on, which are all very important parts of creative education in our child-care centres, and they are definitely within the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guidelines have been developed to encourage diversity and creativity. There is no mention in any of the material of the allegations that have been made by Senator McGauran. So it is fairly obvious to me that Senator McGauran has not had the benefit of the balanced program provided to our current generation of kids in kindy or he would not be behaving the way he has in the last few days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These guidelines have the broad support of the industry. They are nothing more than guidelines. What they simply put forward is best practice in kindergartens, and that best practice is currently the practice covered in many of the institutions throughout this country. As with any aspect of our society, there is always room for improvement. We have guidelines so that we can make the education of our children even better than it currently is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this vein, I would also like to talk about the work performed by another very important organisation in our community, and that is the organisation of nursing mothers. The Nursing Mothers Association of Australia and, in particular, the work of its Queensland branch, is very valued in my electorate of Lilley. The Nursing Mothers Association of Australia is a large and well-established organisation, with something like 14,000 members in a network of 526 locally based support groups throughout Australia. The Nursing Mothers Association provides breastfeeding information and counselling through something like 1,700 trained volunteer counsellors, who also provide general support for mothers in their parenting role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland branch of the association is the second largest branch of the national organisation. In Queensland, it has the largest telephone counselling service; it has about 110 groups operating throughout the state, with about 352 counsellors and 134 trainees. Apart from the essential core of paid staff at national headquarters, the work of the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia is essentially carried out by volunteers spread throughout this country. The Nursing Mothers Association of Australia endorsed the following statement from the joint World Health Organisation/UNICEF meeting in Geneva in October 1979:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Breastfeeding is an integral part of the reproductive process, the natural and ideal way of feeding the infant and a unique biological and emotional basis for child development.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to report that the work of voluntary counsellors and women such as Georgina Bloomfield, Bronwyn Carnell, Heather Chisholm, Marie Grey, Cathie Parminter, Anne Conway, Sherrill Sherwood, Frances Price, Jan Ayre, Julie Davis, Leigh Lance, Kathie McKeown, Jennie Barnard, Rosemary Lyall, Bev Steward, Joy Tomlinson, and many others in my local area is now being fully supported by the Commonwealth and state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This group has been the beneficiary of a grant under the national women's health program of some $38,000, approved over 12 months ago. That grant was used to establish a resource centre for counsellors and other health professionals as well as for mothers with young babies. Unfortunately, however, that funding for the Queensland branch ceased on 29 July 1993. No more funding is available under this program until March next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, following strong representations to the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, and the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, the Queensland branch of the Nursing Mothers Association has been successful in receiving an interim grant of $12,000 under the community organisation support program, so that it can continue its work until March of next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that both these grants reflect the priority that this government attaches to the work done by the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia. In a society which is becoming much more complex and depersonalised, the back-up of the Nursing Mothers Association provides an absolutely essential support for our families: our mothers and fathers and their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, the Nursing Mothers Association has also been active in supporting women who choose to combine child rearing with a career. Recently, the Nursing Mothers Association in Queensland published a booklet which targeted the needs of working women. The existence of the association means that a woman can simply pick up the phone and reach a trained counsellor nearby who can give her information on a myriad of breastfeeding topics. That is the value of the Nursing Mothers Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, if it were not for the existence of voluntary organisations such as this, the bill to the Commonwealth and state governments in other health related matters would be far greater. It is the work of volunteers and organisations such as this that makes our community a much more compassionate and caring one, and we should pay tribute to the work done by the hundreds of volunteers in organisations such as the Nursing Mothers Association. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) has conceded in some speeches in recent weeks what many people around Australia involved in education have been saying for some time, that the government's education policy is a mess. Throughout its period of office this Labor maladministration has poured money into higher education. Together, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out in his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> address, schools and universities have accounted for virtually all the growth in education and training since 1983. The number of 15-year-olds to 24-year-olds with university degrees has risen by 43 per cent over the period, while the number with trade qualifications has fallen by 11 per cent. And whose responsibility is this? It is the government's, of course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet our Prime Minister can tell us ingeniously that vocational education is the cinderella of the Australian education system. In the same speech delivered in Perth in October, the Prime Minister told his audience that the vocational sector lacked the resources and prestige of universities and often acted as an `add-on to a generalist school-level education'. He continued sadly that `this dismissal of vocational education' which persisted in some quarters had cost Australia dearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, but who dismissed vocational education? Was it not the same Labor government which was hell-bent on driving the Dawkins plan for making all the world a university, with his so-called unified national system of welding universities with the colleges of advanced education which had performed a vocational function with great efficiency? The Dawkins plan was driven by Labor's old chip on the shoulder mentality, where one deals with an institution that is perceived to be elitist by allowing mass access to it. This is called `satisfying demand'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While increasing the opportunity for, and the level of, education for all Australians is imperative, the trouble is that one can never satisfy demand, as the government has now belatedly recognised.

He pointed out that, while the OECD average expenditure on higher education represents 2.6 per cent of governments' budgets, Australia invests 4.5 per cent of government expenditure in higher education; Germany spends two per cent: and Japan just 1.1 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Beazley, to do him justice, is resiling from the middle class cringe displayed so abundantly in the educational policy of his predecessor, the present Treasurer (Mr Dawkins).

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are only so many places and it is not realistic for all year 12 leavers to aspire to enter a university.

<PARA>The assumptions that have driven Australia's education reforms in the last few years have been shown to be misplaced. In an EPAC study by Dr Leo Maglen of Monash University he makes a convincing case that education is not the investment in human capital that it was thought to be. Dr Maglen says that it is not education that makes future workers more productive but rather that productivity comes from on the job training and experience. Education he says is no more than a filtering mechanism which sorts trainees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expanding post-compulsory higher education then may have no direct effect on productivity and economic growth. In fact, if it outstrips the growth in jobs usually associated with that level of education it merely results in credentials creep, an ever rising educational standard that is out of kilter with the work done. To some extent education does provide a competitive advantage in obtaining employment but once higher education becomes widespread that advantage diminishes and the earnings differential also diminishes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While disadvantaged groups theoretically have greater educational opportunities, there is no evidence that this has been converted into improved economic outcomes and significantly changed income distributions. The study concluded that the `more is better' policy was wasteful and resources should be targeted at primary and secondary education for it is only here that there appears to be a link between education, skills and productivity. Dr Maglen argued that there should be more employment related training programs on the grounds that this has a much more direct impact on productivity than general education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 10 years in office the Labor government has only just realised that the overhaul of vocational training should have been its first priority. The reality is that the number of apprentices has dropped by 20 per cent since 1989 and industry has halved its intake of new recruits. The manufacturing sector lost 24 per cent of its apprentices between 1989 and 1992, the wholesale and retail trades lost 28 per cent and the construction industry lost 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vocational education and training in this country is still sitting among the cinders. That is why some $20 million allocated for training for the long-term unemployed in the current financial year has not been spent to create as much as one single new job skill or LEAP position. Why is the government sitting on this money which could be alleviating the sorry plight of at least some of Australia's one million unemployed? Even if these funds were allocated today, given that many of the places are provided by local government, it is unlikely that the places would be taken up before the end of January because of the Christmas break. Only the government can answer that, and I ask the minister for education to explain why the $20 million today remains unspent.

Particularly apparent is the use of analytical techniques and assumptions that really have relevance, if anywhere, only to business and industry and certainly not to the delivery of social policy. I will go through a few examples as illustration of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the Industry Commission recommends greater transparency and accountability in the delivery of public housing assistance to public tenants. I cannot really speak with any great degree of knowledge on the situation in other states, but I certainly know a fair bit about the circumstances in Victoria. It seems to me that in Victoria there already is perfectly adequate transparency in the nature of assistance provided to tenants and no lack of accountability on the part of tenants for the assistance that they receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that if we are to pursue this neoclassical, ideological approach&mdash;I suppose I could call it that&mdash;to its logical extent, then on issues like the basis on which tenants can apply for priority, for example, disability, particular crisis circumstances in their families and whatever, it may be suggested that the rest of the world has a right to know the details about such issues on the basis of this principle of transparency. It is also a worry that the existing stigma that tends to attach to people living in public housing will be exacerbated by increased emphasis on these notions of transparency and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second recommendation, which again is illustrative of the tendency of the Industry Commission to approach such issues with an economic rationalist industry approach rather than a social policy approach, is that the functions of management of property and management of tenancies should be separated in the provision of public housing. For example, in a major public housing estate the functions of owning and administering the estate, buying or selling the property, ensuring that it was maintained and the like, would be done by a property manager in one department of state government. The functions of administering tenancies&mdash;being the landlord for the public tenants&mdash;would be administered by another department, a welfare department, rather than the current situation which is that these two functions are combined within a single housing related department. The name keeps changing in Victoria but the basic approach remains the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This recommendation reflects the current obsession amongst the economic rationalist community for taking public sector organisations and cutting them up into little bits whenever there is some degree of dissection potentially available and trying to separate the various functions. That may in certain circumstances have some degree of logic, but certainly in this situation it has no logic at all. If it were implemented, what would occur is that the property decisions would be more market driven and hence people would tend to drift further out into the outer suburbs, where amenities are less and land and property are cheaper; the need for a return on investment to government would dominate decisions further; tenancy problems would go down the list in order of priorities; and the classic area which would be of great concern is the ability of tenants to get reasonable maintenance on their properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one goes around the housing estates of inner Melbourne and talk to tenants, one of the first complaints that one will be hit with time after time is the inordinate amount of effort that is required to get very simple maintenance done. This was so under the previous Labor government. The situation is worse now under the current Liberal government and, if the responsibility for maintenance was in the hands of a property manager one step further removed from the tenancy manager with whom the tenants were dealing, the situation would only get worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then have the recommendation from the Industry Commission that rent rebates should be based on equivalent market rent values. I concede that there is a need for some form of benchmark to ensure that there is some degree of equality of assistance being offered to people in different  circumstances so that we do not find some people getting substantially more assistance than others who in effect are in the same circumstances, and that therefore some market reference does have a degree of significance. However, it is extremely dangerous to take this principle too far, because for obviously reasons it is difficult to find any market that is comparable, for example, with a 20-storey high-rise block of flats in an inner Melbourne suburb. There are no 20-storey high-rise blocks of flats in the private sector. There is nothing that is directly comparable with the housing stock that is being leased, and it is extremely difficult to determine the boundaries of any market that one may wish to use as a basis for comparison&mdash;what the area would be, how far one would take it, what the different groups of people in the market actually constitute, and whether it forms a market that is suitable for the basis of comparison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation by the Industry Commission would in effect lead to the dismantling of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement which, in spite of some weaknesses, has served this nation well for many decades. The recommendation is in effect that the Commonwealth would provide money via the states for rental assistance only, subsidising rent for low-income people, and the states would retain the responsibility for capital investment in public housing. This would be a recipe for a very substantial reduction of investment by the states in public housing. It would mean that the Commonwealth's commitment to public housing would go straight into the pockets of private landlords, and it would also mean that in the longer term we would have a much more wasteful use of public money because there would be no public asset left at the end of the day after the expenditure of this money. By contrast, the approach that is currently in place does mean that we have a durable asset which continues to benefit new generations of public tenants as a result of the money that is expended by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further recommendation focusing on the importance of pushing out from public housing public tenants who have had a change of circumstances and who are now in a better income situation. Clearly we do not want to have a situation where millionaires are living in public housing with assistance from the public purse, so there is some need for some pressure of that type. However, we should be very mindful of the need to avoid creating yet another poverty trap, a disincentive for people to get further employment and earn further income, because of the risk that they may as a result lose their home and have to move out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, it is very important that we do not allow public housing estates to be turned into ghettos where only people on social security benefits are living. It is very important that there is a good social mix of people, including people who are in the work force. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This data released yesterday is just one of a series of data which is being systematically released by the bureau, indicating what I think is a strengthening economy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, we have more information released today on company profits, where company profits have recorded their ninth consecutive quarterly increase and are now at the highest level since this particular series commenced in 1985. Part of the reason why we have this indication of strengthening business investment is due not only to business perceptions of the economy but also to the underlying conditions within the economy&mdash;inflation at a 30-year low, interest rates at a 20-year low and the specific action the government has taken through its general investment allowance, the special investment allowance and the new company tax rate of 33 per cent. This demonstrates that the government's initiatives in One Nation, the investing in the nation program and subsequently have been important in encouraging business to make its investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am releasing today the fifth quarterly report of the Development Allowance Authority, which reveals that a total of 56 projects were registered during the quarter. This brings the number of total projects registered to 121 and the total capital value of projects registered to date in the order of $27 billion, with plant accounting for $22 1/2 billion. We have seen the DAA systematically going through the applications every quarter, registering a new large number of investment proposals and today cynicism and scepticism oozes out of every pore of the opposition whilst it grizzles about the fact that the economy is doing better and there is clear evidence that investment is beginning to pick  up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investment has been one of the missing links in the Australian recovery.

I look forward to the outcome of this work and to see whether something useful may come of it because I am quite sure we could engender a cooperative attitude between the Commonwealth, the states and local government. At any rate, the honourable gentleman has made his interest in the subject abundantly clear over time and, as a consequence, the area of the federal seat of North Sydney and the immediate area are so much the better for his having been around.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for her question. The question went to assistance being provided through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say by way of preface to the honourable member that we recently published the Burdekin report dealing with the issue of mental illness. In responding to that report, I have tried to make it clear that, if we are going to deal with the issue of mental illness more effectively in this country, then we are going to have to change attitudes and culture so that we are able to overcome some of the prejudice and some of the stereotypes that are associated with mental illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those prejudices was that we would not expect people who had had a psychiatric illness, people who had been mentally ill, to be rehabilitated or to be able to make it back into the work force. I discovered that the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service did not particularly concentrate on providing a service for people who had been psychiatrically ill. So about a year ago the government established something like 11 units of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service around the country particularly focusing on the needs of people who had been psychiatrically ill. It is to the results of those units that I want to refer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A total of 72 per cent of clients who complete the program provided by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service get jobs. That is a success rate of around 78 per cent, with a very difficult client group in an extremely tight labour market. We are also finding associated with that group something like a 70 per cent reduction in rehospitalisation. That is, the number of people who have had a tendency to move between the community and go back into hospital is very substantially reduced where people have been through that process of rehabilitation offered by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is particular significance, in view of the government's interest in employment and the green paper, for these results. They show that a case management approach, as it has been developed and, I think, practised highly successfully, can be of very considerable assistance to those who are out of the work force and to the long-term unemployed. I commend to my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training the results of these pilot studies because I think they are of very much broader significance. If we are going to be able to have success&mdash;I think we have demonstrated through projects such as JET that we can have considerable success with people with serious disabilities being able to return to the work force&mdash;a case management approach is extremely important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by making the point that in these experiments the results have been quite arresting, quite outstanding. They certainly provide a great deal of food for thought, as the government will be considering over the next few months both the issue of mental illness arising out of the Burdekin report and also the green paper and its subsequent white paper on employment.</PARA>

When the minister personally approved a grant of $49,000 for the Eastern Suburbs Maitland Cricket Club in the electorate of Paterson, was she aware that the club had no ground; that no development application or building application had been lodged; and that the paddock being used by the club as a practice ground was near an old local gasworks and is now being checked by the Environmental Protection Authority for possible contamination? What role in the application was played by a member of the cricket club, Mr Tony Keating, the endorsed state Labor candidate for Maitland and now a staff member of Mr Bob Horne, who won this, the most marginal of all Labor seats at the election held after the announcement of the grant?</PARA></TALK.START>

As a consequence, as I said yesterday, the government, when considering Mr Black's interests, agreed to make it clear that Mr Black could have enough of the voting stock, and the stock of the company, to indicate that he could control it and to give the group, therefore, the cohesion and commercial direction which it had lacked for some time in the flux created by the takeover of John Fairfax and Sons by Mr Warwick Fairfax.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have noticed that it is the habit now of the government to ensure that the appropriate minister refuses to respond to matters of public importance. Today it is the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) who is to respond instead of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). But yesterday, very significantly, when the MPI was proposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on the matter of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) not only allowing for an increase in ownership of the Fairfax group by Mr Conrad Black&mdash;a foreigner&mdash;but also doing so on the condition that the Fairfax newspapers provided more balanced reporting, the Prime Minister refused to respond to that matter of public importance. In a cowardly way, he waited until question time today, got a backbencher to ask a dorothy dix question about it and then spent 10 raving minutes abusing, denigrating, breaching standing orders and inventing positions of the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Prime Minister is culpable on this issue and will always be held culpable because not only did he increase foreign ownership but also he increased that foreign ownership on the basis of a condition: that the Fairfax newspapers should provide more so-called balanced reporting. That, frankly, is a measure of the morality&mdash;or should I say a measure of the immorality&mdash;of the Prime Minister in public affairs in this country; that is a measure of his imperial grandeur, regardless of the consequences for the nation and regardless of the consequences for the people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is relevant to the matter of public importance before the House today. I will explain why. One of the characteristics of the Prime Minister is his tendency to say things which are untrue. He has been doing that this afternoon. On 12 February 1991 in this very chamber the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are very few governments in this country that manage their financial affairs more soundly and tightly than the Labor Government of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely risible. It is yet another example of a Prime Minister who can never be trusted to tell the truth. This is a man who, when he became Prime Minister, said that he would resist the temptation to gild the lily and has since poured all the gold he can find over any flower that blooms. The fact is that he is a Prime Minister who will never be trusted by the people of this country. The fact is that he is just one of a group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) yet again demonstrate that she is not worthy to hold the office of minister of the Crown in this country. It is a matter of shame to the Labor Party that it should continue to prop up such a totally incompetent minister. Indeed, she is one of the most incompetent Labor politicians in this country. Another is the Premier of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many honourable members will be amused to hear that this very morning the Premier of South Australia blew a hole in the government's national fiscal strategy. Way back in April of this year, Mr Arnold produced a report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting the challenge</EMPHASIS> in which he outlined how he would reduce the state debt of South Australia to $7 billion by 1996. But Mr Arnold, not being any more truthful in his activities than the Prime Minister, gave what I think everyone would agree was a quite extraordinary interview at a press conference yesterday. Remember, he stipulated back in April that his debt target would be $7 billion by 1996. He was asked yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What's your target 1997 in real terms?</PARA>
<PARA>This, of course, is a year later than 1996. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our target in 1997 is about $7.8 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>Journalist:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I take it you meant $6.8 billion because you were hoping to reach $7 billion the year before that.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Arnold said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well I think the figure is about $7.8 billion after the three years.</PARA>
<PARA>Journalist:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thought it was $7 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Arnold said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Um . . . I think it's $7.8.</PARA>
<PARA>This went on until the journalist asked, `Do you really mean $7.8 billion? Is it nominal? Is it real?'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, actually I think you're right. It was $7.8 nominal and $7 real. No I'm sorry . . . in my mind . . . my mistake.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on and on with this blithering nonsense which ended up with him saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oh well I'd have to come back and see those figures.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he did not have a clue what his deficit reduction strategy was. But today the Premier of South Australia released the South Australian Treasury's forward estimates. Do they show that he has been telling the truth over the last few months since April, that the South Australian government will reduce the debt to $7 billion by 1996? No, they do not. The figures show that the real debt by that time will not be $7 billion but nearly $7.6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, today we learned that there has been a $600 million blow-out in the South Australian government's debt reduction strategy&mdash;exactly the same amount of money as `Pork-barrel Paul' poured into the South Australian budget during the last federal election. In other words, the $600 million that went to South Australia from Canberra is chewed up today by the South Australian government blowing out the debt by $600 million by 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Arnold was immediately thrown on the defensive, rushed off and tried to explain this misleading information. Firstly, he said that state Treasury told his office last week that the debt would blow out by $600 million in 1996. But this information was passed on to him not last week but on Tuesday of this week, the day before yesterday, late in the afternoon after his notorious press conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we do know that the federal government and the federal Treasury knew last week all about this blow-out in the state government's debt. That information was transmitted to the federal Treasury last week and no doubt it passed that information on to the Treasurer and to the Prime Minister. So we can conclude that those people in Canberra had been sitting on this information, and only a fool would believe that Mr Arnold did not know his debt figure had blown out by $600 million last week. The reason why this debt will blow out has to be described as little short of extraordinary. He says that debt has been redefined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and that redefinition has `taken place in very recent times. This happened after the August budget'. They were his words this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this question of the redefinition of debt by the Australian Bureau of Statistics was decided at a Premiers Conference&mdash;and I thought this man was the Premier&mdash;in May 1991, to be applied from 1 July 1993. There was even a press release that went out from the Treasury on 11 July 1991 explaining how this redefinition of debt by the Australian Bureau of Statistics would take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So for Mr Arnold to come out today and say that there has been a redefinition of debt very recently is for Mr Arnold to not tell the truth. Mr Arnold is not telling the truth about this blow-out in state debt. This is a blow-out of $400 per head for every man, woman and child in South Australia, and Mr Arnold apparently was not told about it by his office for a whole week. Nobody is going to believe that; nobody on earth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the miserable saga goes on. Mr Arnold claims that the reason for the blow-out in state debt is also the State Bank sale price has apparently been overvalued. It has been made clear to Mr Arnold for months now that his determination to suck $160 million out of the State Bank to fund his election bribes will, of course, reduce the value of the State Bank. One would think if he knew anything about money, business or economics he would have taken that into account. But apparently he did not. His claim today that the State Bank cannot be sold for as much as he originally proposed is simply a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that throughout the whole of this saga we can conclude one thing about Mr Arnold: Mr Arnold is not telling the truth. Mr Arnold is telling South Australians porkies about the size of the debt of that state. The sooner South Australians get rid of him the better, because then at least in that state we can have honest government&mdash;even if we have to wait two years to get honest government at the national level as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State Bank, of course, has been the great saga of South Australia. It has caused devastating damage to the state, and its collapse is entirely the responsibility of the state Labor government. The Prime Minister went to Adelaide on 8 November and while he was there he claimed that the present South Australian government had no responsibility for the collapse of the State Bank. The fact is that eight out of the existing 13 ministers were in the cabinet between 1989 and 1991 when 200 questions were asked in the state parliament about the problems of the State Bank. Those eight out of 13 ministers appointed the board of the State Bank and they also approved a doubling of the capital of the bank to enable the bank to go on the absurd spending spree that it ended up embarking upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, at the end of all this, the state government then had to indemnify the whole exercise&mdash;to provide indemnity of $3.15 billion to bail out the State Bank. But the bailing out of the State Bank is not finished yet because, out of that $3.15 billion, there is only $113 million worth of indemnity left. There is only $113 million left to finance two years of substantial losses by what is known as the `bad bank' over the next two years, and also to finance the Remm centre disaster to which the State Bank lent $740 million&mdash;which the bank values now at $205 million and is more likely to be worth something in the vicinity of $100 million to $150 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we know about the State Bank saga is that a further bailout of the State Bank is almost inevitable. A fifth bailout of the State Bank of South Australia is almost inevitable because $3.15 billion is not going to be enough. The federal government should continue to monitor very closely the impact of all of these things on the finances of South Australia. As a matter of fact, I think it is possible that it is, but the federal government is deliberately covering up these issues in order to help the Arnold government skate through to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do honourable members remember what the federal government did during the Victorian election campaign when the Victorian government exceeded its Loan Council limits? The federal government knew all about it; the Treasurer knew all about it. He deliberately did not include those figures in the budget papers. But he knew what was going on in Victoria and he was prepared to cover up rorts by the Victorian Labor government to help it through an election, which of course it lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government is covering up for Arnold as well. It is covering up for Labor in South Australia. It is covering up for its mates. The simple fact is that a fifth bailout of the State Bank is almost inevitable. The state government has passed information to this government about the blow-out in its own medium-term debt strategy, and the federal government is deliberately covering up that information, and has done for at least the last week, in order to help the Arnold government across the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that in the end nothing is going to save the state Labor government in South Australia. No cover-ups by the Prime Minister, no cover-ups by the Treasurer and no degree of confected argument by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer is going to do anything to save the Arnold government in South Australia. Those people have ruined South Australia, just as the federal government is imposing ruin on this country  through debt and unemployment. The electorate of South Australia will take it out on the Labor Party on 11 December. I very much look forward to casting my own vote for the Liberal Party on that day. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anyone who has had a look at the terms portrayed in the matter of public importance and who has listened to the speech just made would have to wonder whether there was any relationship. There was not. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) gets up and talks about truth and honesty in government. A couple of weeks ago, I came in here and had to straighten him out on one of his own press releases in which he sought to misrepresent the fact that millionaires paid less tax than people on incomes of $40,000 to $50,000 a year. Having done that, there was no apology or anything from the honourable member for Mayo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all right for him to get up here and spit a few untruths. In fact, I notice that a new word called `Downerism' is getting about Parliament House. It is not unlike the word spoonerism. If a couple of letters are transposed in a sentence we get the word `spoonerism', but the word `Downerism' means that if something is repeated often enough it must be true. To add flourish to it, it helps if those words can be repeated. I remember after the budget the words `vicious' and `vindictive' were used. In fact, I think the same words kept coming up in about six or seven different interviews on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS>. `Downerism' is up and running around Parliament House and out there in the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the terms of reference of the matter of public importance, we see that the honourable member for Mayo did not even touch on the subject. This government has the best record of any government in recent times in looking after the budget deficit and the fiscal strategy. In this year's budget it sought to bring the budget deficit down to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the opposition's role in that? I think it was signalled fairly early by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) when he said when we get back to parliament it is going to be war in the trenches in terms of what those in the Senate are going to do. With a very responsible budget in terms of looking at the fiscal outlook, what was the role of the opposition to oppose it? In actual fact, if honourable members want endorsement of the federal government's strategy on the budget deficit, we have only to look at the 3 September edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>. On page 23 it quotes Mr David Beers:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the leading ratings agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's, is stunned by the negative reaction in Australia to the budget. "I kind of wonder what people are talking about," comments David Beers, director of the agency's international finance department in New York. "From our standpoint, which is rating bonds, we don't entirely share the pessimism about this budget. We think it is important that it has taken some steps to bring the deficit down to a more sustainable level over a period of time. The comments that people are making are of apocalyptic proportions, as they often are in Australia, about things that are relatively on the margin," he says.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beers says that from the bond market's perspective, the projected reduction in the Australian budget deficit was perhaps the most important initiative.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on he made this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is often forgotten that the government has a pretty good record during the past few years of reducing spending as a proportion of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, he is dead right. In fact, it was the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he was Treasurer&mdash;we will all remember this&mdash;who achieved the first budget surplus since the early 1950s. In the 1987-88 budget the surplus was 0.7 per cent of GDP, in 1988-89 it was 1.7 per cent and in 1989-90 it was 2.2 per cent. So during the good years, the growth years in Australia, the government actually ran budget surpluses&mdash;the first postwar government to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us compare those achievements, now that we are midway through our current term of office, with the budget deficit of 3.4 per cent that the coalition government achieved in 1977-78. This year, this government introduced deficit reduction legislation which, as I have already pointed out, was opposed by the opposition, yet today it proposes a matter of public importance relating to the damage done to the national fiscal outlook. The simple fact is that in the budget this year we went about repairing the national fiscal outlook. I did not hear one word of criticism, one word in anything the honourable member for Mayo said during his 15-minute speech anything the federal government had done wrong in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as though we are the only country in the world that is taking steps in this direction. The United Kingdom government has set itself a fiscal target of reducing the public sector borrowing requirement to 4 1/2 per cent of GDP in 1996-97. With regard to the United States, we all read about and saw on television the trouble that President Clinton had in getting his budget deficit reduction strategy through the House of Representatives and the Senate. His aim, of course, was to get the budget deficit down to 2.6 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. So the figures of 4 1/2 per cent in the UK and 2.6 per cent in the United States do not even come close to what we are going to do. As I said, ours will be about one per cent. In fact, over four years, the budget deficit will be cut by $8.5 billion, from a prospective deficit for 1996-97 of $14.9 billion to $6.5 billion&mdash;all done without help from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public sector will directly contribute $17 billion to the improvement in national savings over the three years to 1996-97. Of course, that was all glossed over by the honourable member for Mayo, who did not lay a single glove on this government about anything. If one listened to what he had to say, it seemed he was more content to roam around South Australia. I have been in this place long enough to know that, whenever a state election is in the offing, people in this place think they can get up and make a few statements about that particular state. I suppose the second speaker in this discussion from the opposition side will also be from South Australia and will get up and make some mindless comment about how bad things are in South Australia. I notice there are a couple of opposition members from South Australia in the chamber. It will be very interesting to hear what they have to say. I doubt whether their comments will be much different from what we have already heard. This is a national parliament. I thought the attack today was going to be on the national government. Of course, there was not a word about it. </PARA>

One of the gauges as to how well the economy is doing is how many questions are asked in this House by those opposite about the economy. The one question asked today by the honourable member for Mayo about the economy was the first question we have heard for at least three weeks. When there are no questions asked about the economy, we know it is doing pretty well. It is not a bad barometer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not about the federal government; it is nothing to do with the federal government. Our record stands unchallenged by the honourable member for Mayo who spoke for 15 minutes here today and said absolutely nothing about the federal government. It is all about good old South Australia. It will be interesting to hear what the second speaker has to say because not much more juice can be squeezed out of that lemon; the honourable member for Mayo has been over it already. It will be very interesting to turn on the television up in my room and see what the second speaker has to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to just after the budget when the honourable member for Mayo had to get on TV. We all remember how he floundered on television when there were a couple of questions about the fact that he wanted to see a lower budget deficit. He agreed with the government about a lower budget deficit but he opposed the means to achieve it. When he was asked on national TV, `Well, how are you going to achieve it?' we got the inevitable answer, `Well we're going to cut government spending'. The question that automatically flows from that&mdash;`If you're going to cut government spending, where are you going to cut it from?'&mdash;was met with a stony silence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have read out the sorts of savings that we are talking about in reducing the prospective budget deficit from $14.9 billion to $6 1/2 billion. If the opposition is going to make those sorts of savings by cutting government spending&mdash;remembering that government spending as a percentage of GDP has been cut by the government back to the 1950s levels&mdash;it would be very interesting to get a list from the honourable member for Mayo of the sorts of spending cuts that he would introduce to come within cooee of getting where our budget reduction strategy would be in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this government that has brought together for the first time a coordinated effort by the federal government and state governments in having a national fiscal outlook. The national fiscal outlook seeks to coordinate the budgets of all the states and the federal government to achieve a common goal, and that goal has been achieved by this government. That will stand as one of our proudest achievements because that will go on into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another very important area is national savings. It was this government that set up the inquiry under Vince FitzGerald to have a look at national savings and report to the government. The report made the key point that movements in public sector saving are an important determination of national savings. The government accepts that proposition and has done something about it. The FitzGerald report also highlighted the need for coordinated efforts among the states and the Commonwealth in identifying the scope for efficiency savings through pursuing budget quality&mdash;through a coordinated benchmarking by program area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, it is the national government working with state governments to try to improve the budgetary situation for all governments in this country with a common objective. That common objective is to make sure that we improve national savings and that we do not put too much of a call on public savings when the recovery gathers pace into 1996-97. The government's budget strategy does that by giving the economy a $16 billion stimulus this year to aid recovery and make sure that recovery keeps going and accelerates through the year to a prospective three per cent annualised in the second half of the year. We believe that in the out years the economy will be expanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget deficit is being run this year for a very good reason, but by 1996-97 we will reduce the call on public savings by the federal government because by then the recovery will have gathered pace and there will be a need not only to repair national savings, but a need then for the private sector, as it expands, to have access to these funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just go through the speech by the honourable member for Mayo on the matter of public importance. His references to untruths, gilding the lily and all those things are fairly hollow, given his personal performance and that of some of his colleagues. In this matter of public importance today he raised a national issue and did not lay a glove on it. He did not speak about it. He spent the first five minutes of his address to this House talking about the MPIs from yesterday and the day before&mdash;and who was speaking on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we hear that sort of rambling at the start of a matter of public importance we understand that there is not much behind it. We listened to the honourable member for Mayo&mdash;I kept listening and had my pen out, ready to write down what he would say about what the federal government has done&mdash;but he did not lay a glove on us; he did not talk about the federal government. It was all about South Australia. That is the opposition mentality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the honourable member for Mayo did not address the subject of his matter of public importance, and given the point I made today&mdash;that it was not only the government's view but that of Standard and Poors&mdash;it can be seen that there is nothing behind this matter of public importance. The government's budget strategy is the right one for Australia. It has been endorsed and passed, and it will do the job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a sandbank in a heavy tide erodes, so the government in South Australia has declined since the announcement of the failure of the State Bank. That decline has seen a number of important departures&mdash;an exodus&mdash;from a number of vocations in South Australia. For instance, former Premier Mr Bannon will study at Flinders University next year. It may be that he should have undertaken that study before he took on the stewardship of South Australia as premier. The Managing Director of the State Bank has departed South Australia for other states&mdash;and was barred from returning for the recent Australian Grand Prix.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These events have had a great effect on South Australia and the national budget because the federal government, in a desperate attempt to shore up the declining Arnold administration, has made available $600 million to in some way bolster the enormous public debt.

He held that position for a sufficient time for it to be stated about the incoming director of the MFP:</PARA>

This man oversaw the failure of the State Bank while in the premier's office, went to the MFP to give it guidance&mdash;and his successor said he had never seen so much bloody poppycock&mdash;then was choofed off by Mr Arnold to teach South Australians to manage and develop public policy.

He committed the opposition there to vote against tax measures that were not only part of the budget but are integral to the government's deficit reduction strategy. By opposing the increase over two years of the petroleum excise and the change to wholesale sales tax rates&mdash;except of course on luxury cars&mdash;and removing the existing concessions for those able to accumulate long service leave and annual leave, the Leader of the Opposition would increase the deficit in 1993-94 by almost $1,400 million and by over $3 billion in 1996-97. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer would increase the deficit in each of the next four years and leave the deficit in 1996-97 over 50 per cent higher than the government proposes. Perhaps the honourable member for Mayo, the shadow Treasurer, could explain how that will result in lower interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy of this year's budget has been based on the enhancement of growth in the short-term through a mild fiscal stimulus this year and a progressive tightening of fiscal policy in the ensuing years. There is a medium-term strategy of deficit reduction and it is crucial to our prospects of sustained economic growth. Without it, the deficit would continue at high levels, thus ensuring a higher level of government demand for domestic savings and damaging the balance of payments outcome as we continue to finance our activities with other nations' savings. It would also generate increased interest rates, so providing a growing disincentive to economic growth. In a nutshell, that is the opposition's policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's deficit target of around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97 requires discretionary measures to raise $9 billion by that year. However, in the aftermath of the budget the government made a number of amendments which will reduce the amount of $9 billion by some $360,000 million in 1996-97, thus leaving us with a deficit of 1.2 per cent of GDP compared with 1.1 per cent originally contained in the budget. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry into the Midford Paramount case and related matters investigated the failed prosecution of a Wollongong based shirt manufacturer, Midford Paramount, and revealed significant failings in Commonwealth administration. This of necessity resulted in a report to the parliament which was critical of both the Australian Customs Service and, to a lesser extent, the DPP. While the committee may have anticipated that these agencies would not agree with all of its recommendations, it did not at any time foresee the gratuitous comments that would be offered by the DPP in the Finance minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DPP's comments, if read in isolation, would present a reader with a false view of the committee's inquiry and report 325. Therefore, to ensure that the parliament and other interested parties are presented with a balanced view, the committee has prepared this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DPP's criticisms appear to be based on selective quoting and a failure to read the entire report, contain simple errors of comprehension, and demonstrate a lack of understanding of basic fundamentals such as public accountability, the role and functions of parliamentary committees and the presumption of innocence. The committee is disappointed at the comments made by the DPP for they indicate that the director has learnt little from the Midford case or the committee's inquiry. Given the breadth of the committee's inquiry, it is significant that the DPP chose to make no comment on the vast majority of the report even though he did not confine himself to findings relating to the DPP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Needless to say, the committee is firmly of the view that report 325 stands on its own merits as a thorough and balanced document. I commend this report to the House. </PARA>

I also seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table these reports of the Australian parliamentary delegation which visited Colombia from 26 September to 3 October 1992 and attended the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference held in the Bahamas from 4 to 10 October 1992. The delegation comprised Senator the Hon. Kerry Sibraa, President of the Senate as leader of the delegation; Mr Wilson Tuckey, MP, deputy leader; Senator Bruce Childs; Senator Gerry Jones; and, for the CPA conference, Senator Shirley Walters. Mr Kieran Schneemann, delegation secretary; Mr Fred Peppinck, senior adviser to the President; Mrs Jenny Tuckey; Mrs Judy Childs; Mrs Rita Jones; and Dr David Walters comprised the rest of the party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit to Colombia was the first by an official Australian parliamentary delegation and reciprocated the 1989 visit to Australia by a parliamentary delegation from Colombia. The delegation visited Bogota and the old Spanish fortress city of Cartegena. Unfortunately, a visit to Cali to look at agricultural research had to be cancelled at the last moment. The delegation met with the President of Colombia, Dr Cesar Gaviria Trujillo. In fact, I have to say that I was amazed at the informality when he first came into the room. I think we were wondering whether or not the President had arrived, he was so informal and relaxed. But that added greatly to the discussions we had which were very informal, but otherwise very productive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That meeting was in addition to meetings with a number of ministers, and in all meetings there was free-ranging and frank discourse on economic growth, foreign investment, drugs and security, and Colombia's increasing Pacific focus. In most meetings we were able to refer to, and provide copies of, the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Australia and Latin America and indicate that Australian public and private enterprises were awakening to the potential for expanded trade and joint venture operations with Latin America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opportunities for exports from Australia that were apparent to me have been drawn to the attention of people within my electorate and my state. I am hoping that they are progressing. There were some quite surprising opportunities in terms of what Australia might provide and what Australia might learn, particularly in the area of produce of the sea and of course aquiculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Colombians expressed disappointment that we had not yet established an embassy in Bogota, but the delegation records its appreciation of the excellent job which was being done by the Honorary Consul for Australia, Dr Dario Cardenas Navas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation was surprised by the relative strength and increasing sophistication of the Colombian economy. While Australia and Colombia have cooperated closely as members of the Cairns Group, it is also clear that Colombia can become a formidable competitor in both the agricultural and mining sectors. We were also extremely interested to meet people who have been to Australia and picked up our technology in the solar area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think most of us have visions of places like Colombia as lush tropical jungles. But, quite surprisingly, we were told by a gentleman we met who is actively involved in this area that there are in fact very large areas which he called the `Australia of Colombia'. These areas are quite arid and offer subsistence living to the people who live there. Technology of the type available in Australia in the solar area&mdash;even simple windmills&mdash;is being used to lift the living standards of those people. We had discussions with this gentleman and others who had been to Australia and recognised Australia as a leader in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would like to thank our hosts in the Colombian parliament&mdash;the then President and Speaker&mdash;for the warmth and generosity of their welcome. I would like to thank Ambassador and Mrs De Stoop who accompanied the delegation, and also Ms Maggie Pinsent for the excellent translation work done for the delegation. I would also like to record my personal thanks to our principal guide from the Senate's public relations department, a young lady whom we all got to know by her Christian name, Ampoora. I cannot add from memory her rather lengthy surname. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation also attended the 38th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference in the Bahamas. Prior to the conference, the Bahamas had been subject to two major upheavals. In August the Bahamas had its first change in government for 25 years, and four days after the elections Hurricane Andrew badly devastated a number of the Bahamas islands. In recognition of the need for costly reconstruction programs by the Bahamas authorities, the CPA executive committee proposed the cancellation of the traditional conference tours, which had been focused on the quincentennial of the arrival of Columbus in the New World. The funds were redirected to assistance to people who had been disadvantaged or had suffered injury or loss of property in the hurricane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference heralded a different format from that presented in previous years, with greater emphasis on panel discussions within a single conference theme. This was one of the major recommendations of the report of the working party on the CPA and the future, which had been chaired by Senator Kerry Sibraa since its inception at the New Delhi conference in 1991. Senator Sibraa presented the report of the working party to the General Assembly and it was accepted in its entirety. The chairman of the executive committee expressed the association's thanks for the work done by Senator Sibraa and his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The draft constitution, which had also formed part of the working party's report, was presented to the General Assembly. But the proposal was lost when it did not receive the required two-thirds majority of the votes cast, although it did receive over 50 per cent support. I do not think that particular proposal is lost. The simple fact was&mdash;and Australians participated in this process&mdash;that there were some concerns about the potential effect of the constitution expressed by nations from different parts of the world. I am sure it will come back to the next conference in a slightly amended form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference also saw the appointment of Mr Arthur Donahoe as Secretary-General to succeed Dr David Tonkin. Senator Sibraa also retired as a member of the Executive Committee (Australian Region) and was replaced by Mr George Gear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, addressed the conference on developments in the Commonwealth, making particular reference to Commonwealth efforts in South Africa and the increasing focus on election monitoring. Chief Anyaoku also attended the now traditional Australia-New Zealand function in honour of the host branch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation would like to express its thanks to the Australian High Commissioner to Jamaica and the Caribbean, Mr Peter Rodgers, and Mrs Rodgers as well as the fine support work done by Ms Virginia Brueckner. I also thank officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Relations Office for helping with the delegation's program. I thank Kieran Schneemann and Fred Peppinck, the workhorses of the delegation, who looked after so many of the more administrative details. As officers of this parliament, as usual, they did a wonderful job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are considerable opportunities for closer exchanges with Colombia on education, social policy and federalism. Our parliamentary ties are both close and warm and the bestowal of the Extraordinary Order of the Grand Cross&mdash;in gold&mdash;by the Colombian Congress on Senator Sibraa was a reflection of the high esteem in which the Colombian parliament holds the Australian parliament. I have left this particular paragraph until last because that bestowal was certainly the highlight of the visit. Australia can be very proud of the serious manner in which the Colombian Senate attended the presentation of this order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate was full&mdash;all members were present&mdash;and a choir from the military academy rendered both the Australian and the Colombian national anthems. In fact, the singers had a better knowledge than I of the two verses of the Australian national anthem. It was sung with great ability. The delegation was very proud to be present because this presentation was a very true recognition of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation was also very pleased to hear how concerned and interested Colombia is in maintaining its embassy in Australia and is also concerned that some day Australia reciprocate. Colombia is very interested in Australia and recognised the delegation in the highest possible fashion through the presentation to Senator Sibraa. I was very proud to have been present. I commend these two reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pity that the change in Australian society is such that, if one dares to disagree with some of the politically correct thoughts, one is branded a racist. If one says something out of the mainstream about Aboriginal affairs, multiculturalism or Asian migration, open debate is inhibited and one is immediately attacked for not agreeing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make passing reference to the fact that a couple of weeks ago I asked a question of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) about Aboriginality in this legislation, the Native Title Bill. The question was not answered and, quite frankly, I was subjected to 10 or 12 minutes of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally reject any allegation that I am racist; but I do believe that we should have one law for all Australians. I believe in equality for all Australians before the law. I am totally opposed to any form of prejudice or apartheid. I believe equally strongly that, as a caring and compassionate society, we must look after the needy and those suffering disadvantage in our society&mdash;a situation in which Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders find themselves. They are disadvantaged in housing, health, education and employment; their life expectancy is lower and they are disadvantaged in infant mortality, disease and infection. But I do believe that, in the interests of equality, all Australians should be looked after on the basis of need, not race, skin colour or creed. Unfortunately, Australian society is going down the wrong track of institutionalising discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Democracy in this country is alive and well. We are very fortunate to be among the few countries where democracy is practised. The vast majority of the 174 member countries of the United Nations do not exercise democracy at the same level that we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say quite definitely and specifically that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are, in many ways, in dire need. I refer briefly to the disgracefully high level of diabetes among Torres Strait Islanders. Equally, it is a great shame and a disgrace that, three years after ATSIC was created, the Torres Strait Islander health policy has not yet been created, let alone implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, help is desperately needed for the small children in the Macleay Valley in my electorate. Something like 94 per cent of Aboriginal children between the ages of three and six years have been identified as having the disease otitis media&mdash;glue ear&mdash;which means they have hearing difficulties. This means that the six-year-old kid starting school is about three years behind in socialisation and language development. When these kids start school they cannot hear, so they cannot understand what is being said and they cannot learn. Therefore, one has a continuation of the stereotype that Aboriginal people are dumb, stupid and cannot learn. That is not the case. This situation is artificially created by a medical condition which we tend to ignore. So we have to go much further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Life expectations of Aboriginal men and women are much less than other Australians. Aboriginal men and women have a life expectancy of 20, 25 to 30 years shorter than other Australians. It saddens me desperately when I stop and reflect that most Aboriginal males born the same year as I are already dead and gone. It is a sad reflection on our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the opportunity of speaking with a great many Aboriginal people and organisations in Queensland, the Torres Strait, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Time and time again one is told by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that they do not believe that we will cure their problems just by throwing money at them and, quite frankly, I agree. We have to go beyond just throwing money at the problems in the hope that they will go away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know the accurate figure, but we already spend $2 billion on Aboriginal affairs&mdash;$1.3 billion from the Commonwealth, the rest from the states. That is $2 billion in entitlements of Aboriginal people over and above that of other Australians to health, education, unemployment benefits, pensions or so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I firmly believe that the road to success for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is education. We need to have an incredible emphasis on education, and I do not mean just teaching kids the three Rs. I have been to Lockhart River in North Queensland, to Thursday Island, Badu, Yorke and Darnley, and quite a number of other Aboriginal areas around Australia. It needs to be education in the wider things; in health, for instance&mdash;not just in ordinary, perceived academic education. It has to go much further than that. The present legislation really presents a situation where we all need education. It is not clear. I believe it will create more problems than it will cure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present legislation is not understood by the vast majority of Australians, either of Aboriginal or European origin. It is being rushed through this House. It was introduced on 16 November&mdash;only last week&mdash;with three days debate this week, and it will be put through this House and carried, of course, on the numbers tonight. I do not believe that this is enough time for the people of Australia to consider what is in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly there has been nowhere near enough consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I understand that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) talks to five people as his advisers. They seem to be&mdash;and I do not say this in a pejorative sense&mdash;professionals from the Aboriginal industry, and I do not know how many of them are on the public payroll. But Aboriginal people all around Australia are complaining about the lack of consultation. I refer to that three-day meeting at Eva Valley with 300 Aboriginal leaders from around Australia: they have not even been consulted, as far as I understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask: why the rush? If we accept that there have been 200 years of injustice, it is up to us to get it right. After 200 years I do not think we can possibly attempt to believe that we can solve this in that amount of time. As a parliament we have to act with responsibility, and rushing the legislation through is irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to get it right this time; we really do. Getting it right means no relaxation of the Racial Discrimination Act, except as needed to validate past grants. Getting it right means that compensation should be paid on a non-discriminatory basis, and that is certainly on just terms with the amount determined by a court if there is any dispute. Getting it right means acceptance that native title exists, and this is central to the coalition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting it right means that governments will be responsible for compensation payments for extinguishment of native title&mdash;not individual Australians, not land-holders. Getting it right means that settlements can include, in addition to or as a substitute for cash, substitute land title or interest in other land, or the provision of services and facilities and any other benefit agreed with the claimant. Settlements need to be flexible to meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting it right means provision for all governments&mdash;state, federal and territory&mdash;to legislate to validate past land titles and prevent invalidation of existing titles. Getting it right means acknowledging that states and territories have the right to set their own deadlines for lodging compensation claims. Getting it right means that government funded assistance should be available on an equal basis, not only for native title claimants and compensation claimants but also for the respondents. Natural justice certainly demands that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting it right means having the Commonwealth reimburse the states and territories for compensation payments made for extinguishing native title associated with validating past grants. Getting it right means that Commonwealth legislation should be put through to enable the states and territories to confirm the Crown's ownership of mineral and petroleum deposits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting it right means protecting the existing rights of public access and enjoyment of public places, foreshores, beaches, national parks, recreation reserves and stock routes for all Australians. Getting it right means providing equally for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander aspirations, national development, jobs, economic use of land and further development of Australia's mineral, pastoral and other industries. Getting it right means fairness, justice and equality for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that in my opinion present day Australians should feel no guilt. I personally reject the guilt industry. The government of the day and individuals over the past 200 years have done dreadful and horrible things. There is no excuse for that. The standards of behaviour in Australia at those times were no different to the standards of behaviour elsewhere in the world. That is not an excuse. The fact should be that none of us, white Australians or Aboriginal Australians, should feel any guilt for the past. The sins of the fathers should not be visited on the children. In terms of feeling no guilt, I have shot no-one. My Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander friends have never speared anyone. None of us should feel any guilt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, we cannot live in the past; we have to go forward and we have to go forward together, not in antagonism. We have to go forward together in harmony and, dare I say it, with a degree of love for one another. This is the way we have to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are moves among some Aboriginal organisations&mdash;among some active people&mdash;that there should be a separate nation state. I do not believe that that is in the interests of Australia. It is totally remote from reality, and I for one reject it. At the same time I must say that I have no particular doubt at all about the justification for providing some form of government for the Torres Strait which may be similar to Norfolk Island. I have no quibble or quarrel whatsoever with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians, both Aboriginal and white, have been misled by the rhetoric of the Prime Minister. Of course, his rhetoric is crafted by his own desires and his own ambitions. He wants to see himself as the great statesman, the great legislator, the great bringer of justice to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the father of the republic. In reality, he is only the great destroyer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe in Australia, and I take great pride in our country, in our nation and in areas of activity such as the parliaments. I take pride in what our forefathers did in putting this nation together. I think our system of federation is spot-on. It has worked very well for nearly 100 years, since 1901&mdash;and our federal system is effective, and it works. Brand me as a states `righter', but I am opposed to centralising more power in Canberra. I believe that power should be decentralised. I am opposed to the creation of the new, complex system of bureaucracy which will be created to deal with administrative and legal problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some Aboriginal people will be left out in limbo. I realise that I must finish very shortly to enable my colleagues on both sides of the House to have adequate time. But it should be pointed out that where there is an Aboriginal community, and a minority of people living there are from that area and, because of injustices in the past, other people have been moved in, those people who have been moved in cannot claim native title where they are living now because they do not have that long-term association. They cannot claim native title where they came from because they have been moved from there, so they are in limbo. I believe that this legislation does not address that particular point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I want to make is that there has been very limited mention of the land compensation fund. I believe that Australians everywhere have the right to know what is going to happen. We have been told that in February there will be a social justice bill. Who knows what will come out of that? Australians have the right to know. It has been suggested already by the responsible minister that compensation could take hundreds of millions of dollars. I do not want to be a scaremonger, but I have heard rumours and reports that it could be not hundreds of millions but many, many billions of dollars over the next 10 to 20 years. The matter of compensation has to be dealt with and made public. When we are considering this legislation, the overriding care of all of us should be that we get fairness, justice and equality for all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the Native Title Bill. The calibre of the debate surrounding this bill is a reflection of the importance and magnitude of what the bill represents for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and for the peoples of Australia in this, the International Year for the World's Indigenous People.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Native Title Bill recognises that native title existed and the traditional terra nullius doctrine was, indeed, invalid. It is regrettable that what our forebears did not understand they pushed aside, refusing to acknowledge the intrinsic relationship between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and their traditional lands. Their relationship with the land was not the traditional European concept of land ownership. It was not the way of Aboriginal people to sell their land for a fast dollar, nor was it their way to sell off valuable productive agricultural land for housing development because it was worth more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the Aboriginal people the land was part of them and played a vital role in their way of life, their society and their culture. The Aboriginal people do not take their land for granted as modern society does today. The land played the role of guardian to our early inhabitants, providing them with food and shelter. It looked after them and they looked after it for thousands of years. Their land usage practices may be described today as sustainable agriculture or environmentally friendly practices. Within clan areas, most, but not all, were nomadic, taking advantage of particular areas depending on climatic cycles and thus the productivity of nature. That was until white settlement 200 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to give members a history lesson but merely wish to emphasise the special relationship the Aboriginal people had with their traditional areas. My electorate of Richmond, now one of the fastest population growing electorates in New South Wales, once sustained coastal Aborigines, who lived on plentiful fish supplies and bush foods. It is difficult to envisage this now travelling through the bustling towns of Ballina, Byron Bay, Murwillumbah or Tweed Heads. Time, together with what could be described only as barbaric and inhumane actions by Australia's early settlers, changed this relationship forever. The establishment of settlements and missions, combined with rapid early development on the eastern seaboard, ended the lifestyle of the Aboriginal people. They were moved off good lands to make way for farms and highways and were relegated to remote areas, areas that they were unable to live off, hence the beginning of dependence on white society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not their choice; it was a decision forced upon them.

<PARA>If honourable members think for a moment about that definition, they will realise that it really is a significant statement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This public and legislative recognition of native title and its importance will go a long way towards rectifying many preconceptions that exist in our community regarding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

That was, simply: is it in the interest of all Australians, indigenous or non-indigenous? The answer is unequivocally yes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recognition of the rights and interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in land and waters under their traditional laws and customs is in the national interest.

The division in this country is being perpetuated by such statements.

The Native Title Bill is not, as the opposition would have us believe, a `land grab' or a `free-for-all'. It is simply a recognition under common law of the traditional rights and interests of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. It is not a vehicle that will open Australia up to farcical land claims, nor is it a bill that will end Australia's mining or agricultural operations. There are many examples of mining operations on traditional Aboriginal land where the local Aboriginal people and the mining company enjoy a very harmonious relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is quite specific in its guidelines and how it will operate.

Two of our nearest neighbours&mdash;New Zealand and Papua New Guinea&mdash;have also dealt with the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Native Title Bill, I believe, compares very favourably with the New Zealand situation. The bill is quite specific. It recognises native title and puts into place a mechanism that can establish the existence or non-existence of such title. Some 150 years after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, the issue of native title in New Zealand is still unclear. The Treaty of Waitangi was signed by a crown representative and over 500 Maori chiefs in 1840. There were two versions: one in English and one in Maori. Only 39 chiefs signed the treaty in English; the majority signed the treaty in the Maori language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The treaty in English ceded to Britain the sovereignty of New Zealand and gave the Crown the exclusive right to pre-empt such lands the Maori people wanted to sell. In return, the Maori people were guaranteed full rights of ownership of their lands, forests, fisheries and other prized possessions. The treaty also promised them the rights and privileges of British subjects, together with assurances of crown protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear the Maori text failed to convey the proper meaning of the English version and the treaty negotiations failed to clarify the difference. The Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which they believed guaranteed them and their tribes the right of undisturbed possession of the land they owned in return for handing over supreme political power to the British Queen. As they understood it, the chiefs ceded the right of governance, not the power or sovereignty over the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New Zealand government has established five principles by which it deals with issues arising from that treaty. The principles are consistent with the Treaty of Waitangi and with the observations made by the courts and the Waitangi Tribunal, which was set up in 1975 to deal with issues arising from the treaty. The problem lies in the original treaty. Unlike the Native Title Bill, the Treaty of Waitangi was not clear in what it meant for New Zealand's Maori people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Papua New Guinea has also dealt with the issue, but under contrasting circumstances to that of Australia and New Zealand. Papua New Guinea achieved self-government in 1973 and independence in 1975, when it ceased to be an Australian external territory. Ninety-seven per cent of the total land area in Papua New Guinea is customary land, that is, land owned under traditional or customary title by nationals. Only 3 per cent of the land has been alienated from its traditional owners, the bulk of which is owned by the government. Only a fraction is owned by private leasehold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land owning groups in Papua New Guinea are typically clans or sub-clans which are defined by lineage, with the patterns of entitlements within groups varying to some extent in different areas. Basic ownership rights seem principally a function of effective possession and control, established formerly, and sometimes currently, by force, if necessary. Historically, effective possession and control of land passed back and forth among different groups involved in tribal warfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Papua New Guinea, disputes over ownership of customary land are frequent and extremely difficult to resolve, as there are over 700 tribes in the country, which have few or no records of land ownership. No interests in customary land are presently registered, although two abortive attempts have been made to introduce a registration system in that country. The complexity of the customary ownership issue was never addressed adequately by the two land title acts in that country. According to section 81 of the Land Act 1962-73:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A native has no power to sell, lease or dispose of native land otherwise than to natives in accordance with native custom. A contract or agreement made by him to do so is void.</PARA>
<PARA>This is subject to section 16 of the Land Act, which permits the government to purchase or lease customary land if the native owners are willing to dispose of it otherwise than to natives in accordance with native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Papua New Guinea government also has powers in relation to compulsory acquisition for prescribed public purposes and in accordance with prescribed procedures. Section 56 of the PNG constitution prohibits non-nationals from acquiring freehold interests. Government land is normally made available and allocated for development through 99-year leases in that country. Interests in vacant land are advertised, with all tenders reviewed by the Papua New Guinea Land Board, which makes a recommendation to the Minister for Lands. If the minister disagrees, the matter is referred to the National Council Executive. The complexities Papua New Guinea faces in relation to customary ownership and land tenure are far greater than exist in Australia over native title and current land tenure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise both of these examples as a comparison with what Australia and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities will be achieving with the passage through both Houses of the native title legislation. The native title legislation makes the recognition and determination process of native title clear, with the formation of the Register of Native Title Claims, the National Native Title Register and the National Native Title Tribunal. These bodies, together with state bodies, will ensure that claims and determinations are dealt with fairly and equitably. There will also be avenues for compensation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as well as a land acquisition fund, which will form part of the Native Title Bill's social justice strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Native Title Bill will also give us an opportunity to put the past behind us and look to the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision of the High Court of Australia in Mabo v. State of Queensland (No. 2) is undoubtedly a landmark. It raises for resolution many questions relating to the rights of the indigenous peoples of Australia and the relationship of indigenous peoples to other Australians. The decision presented a unique opportunity for achievement of greater unity among Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actual decision is more limited in scope than some of its supporters make out. The basic proposition for which the case is authority is this: where an identifiable group of indigenous people has had a traditional connection with particular land, and the group has maintained that connection from the time of European settlement, the native title held under the law and customs of the group, by reason of that connection, will be recognised at common law, unless the title has been extinguished. Although there are arguments about the reasons members of the High Court gave for reaching the decision, I believe the basic principle for which the case stands is correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court has been subjected to criticism for engaging in judicial law-making in its decision. Many of the critics have demonstrated a lack of understanding of the functions of the High Court. Others have really been criticising the decision of the majority that this was a situation where the court was able to overturn a longstanding assumption in relation to the law rather than a situation where the court should leave the matter to the legislative process. For my part, I reject the criticisms. However, this is not the occasion for explaining my reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early May this year the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) appointed a task force from the shadow ministry to develop coalition responses to the High Court decision. I was pleased to be included. I relished the challenge of the undertaking and have participated in the endeavours of the task force with some enthusiasm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force has sought to consult widely. It has met representatives of various interest groups, some on several occasions. The task force has also visited remote parts of Australia to consult indigenous communities. Among places visited were the Torres Strait islands, including the Island of Mer; Cape York; the Gulf of Carpentaria; and in Western Australia, the Kimberley and the Gascoyne. The communities were all most hospitable. Their understanding of Mabo and their aspirations in respect of it varied enormously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The working out of a response to Mabo was never going to be easy. That has been recognised on all sides from the time the decision was handed down. It is understandable that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders would seek to maximise claims to native title under the judgment. It is understandable that the mining industry would seek to ensure that native title claims would not inhibit prospecting, exploration and mining. It is understandable that pastoralists would seek to minimise the impact of native title on pastoral leases. It is also understandable that people not directly affected would be expected to have a range of views in relation to native title, from total support to total opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also evident from the outset that the resolution of Mabo would involve the Commonwealth, on the one hand, and the states and territories, on the other hand. The Commonwealth has legislative power and responsibility in relation to the affairs of indigenous people. Power arises under section 51(26) of the constitution which authorises the Commonwealth to make laws for the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court has interpreted this power as encompassing more than mere power to control or protect people of a race if such a need arises and more than a power to control or protect people of a race in their dealings with others. The power enables the Commonwealth not just to protect the people of a race but necessarily extends to the making of laws to protect the cultural heritage of the race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth also has power under the external affairs power, section 51(29), and a responsibility to fulfil Australia's obligations under the International Covenant on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. This responsibility has resulted in the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Under article 1(4) of the convention and section 8 of the act the Commonwealth, in effect, has power to take special measures in certain circumstances to ensure that the human rights and freedoms of people of a race are of the same nature as those of other people of other races. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As against this, responsibility for administration of land has historically been a responsibility of the state governments and more recently of territory governments. This historical position is reflected in the absence of direct legislative power in the Commonwealth on the subject. The states and territories have each developed their own land administration regimes. The administration of the waste lands of the Crown, as crown land used misleadingly to be described, was organised under the land acts of the colonies and since federation has been an important part of state legislation. The Torrens system of land title registration has replaced the common law system of title in the most developed areas of all states and territories and a related system of registration is used for the agricultural and pastoral areas not under the Torrens system. Each state and territory has developed its own regime for regulating mining. There are basic similarities between the systems, but there are significant differences between the different jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of land for the use and benefit of Aborigines has had different histories in the different states and territories. Aborigines have been provided with extensive lands in Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory, but this has been done in different ways. In the Northern Territory and South Australia, it is under land rights legislation. In Queensland, it is under a system of deeds of grant in trust known as dogits. In Western Australia, it has been through setting aside land for Aboriginal use by way of reserves or under trust. In New South Wales, there is a fund for the acquisition of land for Aborigines but they hold comparatively little land. In the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Tasmania, there is either no Aboriginal land or virtually none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The optimum approach to the resolution of Mabo would take into account the constitutional and historical responsibilities of the respective governments. The Commonwealth has a role to ensure that the rights of indigenous people are respected and that their cultural heritage is, in the process, appropriately protected. The states and territories have a duty to continue to provide efficient and economic systems of land management. The optimum result would be one under which the Commonwealth actions in protecting the rights and culture of the indigenous people do not unnecessarily intrude into or burden the land management regimes of the states and territories. The optimum result would also be one under which the maintenance by the states and territories of economic and efficient management of land use does not prejudice the rights or heritage of indigenous people. A sensitive balancing of interests is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To achieve the optimum result, a number of things would have to be done. First, there would have to be cooperation between the Commonwealth government and the state and territory governments. Secondly, there would have to be wide consultation with the various interest groups. Thirdly, there would have to be detailed negotiations in which the interests of all affected groups were taken into account in an effort to achieve maximum consensus. It would require patience, skill, tolerance and sensitivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could never have been thought seriously that the task of achieving the best result in the interests of all Australians would be easy. The initial reactions of the different governments and the different interest groups presented, as a starting point, polarised positions. Identifying appropriate representatives of interest groups also presented problems. But the challenge was there for the Commonwealth government. For all Australians, it was imperative that the greatest possible effort be devoted to achieving a result which all Australians, or at least as many Australians as possible, could support. It was always inevitable that there would have to be compromise to achieve any sort of result. However, the compromise should not have penalised any interest groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the biggest obstacles to be overcome was the need to avoid the issues becoming politicised. If party politics intruded into negotiations of such a sensitive nature, achievement of the optimum result would be impossible. A suitable model was available. In 1990-91, the Commonwealth government and the federal coalition agreed to adopt a bipartisan approach to Aboriginal reconciliation. This resulted in legislation&mdash;the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991&mdash;which continues to this day to be supported on a bipartisan approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened in the resolution of Mabo has not been done on a bipartisan basis. It has not been done on a basis of cooperation between the various governments. The consultations and negotiations have not been conducted on the basis of taking into account all interests. On the part of the Commonwealth, it has not been done with patience, tolerance or sensitivity. The results have been that Victoria has introduced its own legislation and New South Wales has tabled its own version. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What may be foreseen is that the uncertainty and division will grow. If this bill is passed, it will be challenged as unconstitutional. I do not accept the confident assertion yesterday by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) that the bill is valid. There are reasonable arguments that parts of it are invalid. Assuming that the Western Australian bill is passed&mdash;and that seems likely&mdash;it seems as if that also will be challenged. If both bills are passed substantially in the form in which they are being debated, and survive challenge on the basis of basic legislative power, very complex questions will also arise as to the extent to which the Commonwealth legislation will, by virtue of section 109 of the constitution, prevail over the Western Australian legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very sorry state of affairs and causes me profound disappointment. Even if an optimum cooperative result were achieved, there would be a continuing need in the working out and implementation of both Commonwealth and state legislation for a bipartisan and sensitive approach. The prospect is that the working out and implementation of such legislation as survives challenge will be conducted in an atmosphere of division and confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the blame for this result can, in my opinion, be placed on the Commonwealth. Most of the responsibility for ensuring that there was an appropriate national response was with the Commonwealth. Because the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had such a dominant role in the negotiations for the Commonwealth, he carries particular culpability. The Prime Minister has spurned a bipartisan approach. The Prime Minister peremptorily terminated negotiations with the states&mdash;negotiations which showed every sign of being fruitful. The Prime Minister has, since then, sought to go it alone. In this bill, the Prime Minister seeks to impose a solution on the states. The bill constitutes a repudiation of our federal system of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to think that it is not too late to try again. Regrettably, it looks increasingly likely that returning to the negotiating table is no longer an option.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In theory, at least, the whole of Australia could be read as a musical score. There was hardly a rock or creek in the country that could not or had not been sung.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By singing the world into existence, the Ancestors had been poets in the original sense of poesis, meaning `creation'. No Aboriginal could conceive that the created world was in any way imperfect. His religious life had a single aim: to keep the land the way it was and should be.

He sang the Ancestor's stanzas without changing a word or note&mdash;and so recreated the creation . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">White men made the common mistake of assuming that, because the Aboriginals were wanderers, they could have no system of land tenure. This was nonsense.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of Outback Australia was arid scrub or desert where rainfall was always patchy and where one year of plenty might be followed by seven years of lean. To move in such landscape was survival: to stay in the same place suicide. The definition of a man's `own country' was `the place in which I do not have to ask'. Yet to feel `at home' in that country depended on being able to leave it. Everyone hoped to have at least four `ways out', along which he could travel in a crisis. Every tribe&mdash;like it or not&mdash;had to cultivate relations with its neighbour.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for Bruce Chatwin&mdash;honourable members will now notice the change in style. Aboriginals were excluded from the 1901 constitution. As recently as Australia's sesquicentenary celebrations of 1938, Aboriginals were listed under the heading `fauna' in at least one official publication.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am deeply concerned by the degree of misinformation and misplaced anxiety caused by some irresponsible and alarmist reactions to the 1992 High Court of Australia decision in Mabo v.

It needs to be stated over and over that there is no possibility of existing land tenure in Australia's cities and settled areas being disturbed, wild ambit claims by some Aboriginal groups notwithstanding. I regret that the recent Mabo speech on television by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) referred to the fears of dispossession by white landowners without taking the opportunity to emphasise that they had no basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the High Court decide? It rejected the concept of terra nullius and recognised the validity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land tenure under tribal law and lore before 1788 and its continuation since under very limited circumstances. Those limited circumstances require continuous occupation by Aboriginals. This applied in the Murray Islands, the subject of the Mabo case, where the facts were not in dispute. Even the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) says that if he had been sitting on the High Court&mdash;an unlikely prospect to be sure&mdash;he would have found in favour of at least some of the plaintiffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where occupation has been interrupted, the land has been subject to a Crown grant and alienated, for example Parliament House, farms or houses generally, held by freehold or leasehold title, the Aboriginal claims are no longer valid. The validity of Aboriginal claims to unoccupied crown land, where no title has ever been issued or ownership claimed, remains uncertain. Of the seven High Court judges, three thought there was a moral claim by Aboriginals in the absence of occupation, three thought there was not and one judge did not rule on it. However, as he rejected all the Mabo claims, he could be regarded as one of the `not' supporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that some ambiguity has arisen between the passage of the Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act 1975, binding on the states, and the Mabo decision of 1992 where the states had made Crown grants over land where Aboriginals may have been able to claim native title. To the credit of the opposition, it must be said that on two matters it is correct. First, as I understand it, the opposition accepts the Mabo judgment and does not seek to overturn it by referendum or legislation. Secondly, it accepts that the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 is a fixture and will not be overturned. So far we have no disagreement. </PARA>

Canada began to recognise Indian land claims in the 1860s but, again, the process of concluding treaties was protracted. In the 1850s, the British Colonial Office warned settlers in Australian colonies that the justice of Aboriginal land claims would need to be recognised and negotiated on. We have taken 140 years to follow this advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be emphasised that the High Court's Mabo approach is not very different from the common law doctrine of adverse possession; that where an occupier squats on a piece of land without challenge for 15 or 30 years, depending on the jurisdiction, he or she is entitled to title as against another owner. Admittedly, that adverse possession does not run against the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quality of the Mabo judgment was outstanding. The present High Court is of international standing&mdash;and I can be quite bipartisan. Of seven justices, four were appointed by Liberal governments. It has been a characteristic of the High Court from its earliest days&mdash;as with the US Supreme Court in cases ever since Marbury v. Madison in 1803&mdash;to apply the principles of the common law, as they interpreted them, in a spirit of justice in areas where the circumstances of the case required it and where the legislature was silent. This occurred in our High Court with the harvester case, the engineers case and the Egon Kisch case, to mention only three. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who suggest that the High Court is acting in a novel way and acting illegitimately in declaring the law, reveal a profound ignorance of the court, its history and function. I also draw attention to the role of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Jamaican death sentences case, as recently as October 1993 when it acted in exactly the same innovative way. In Mabo v. Queensland two justices, Deane and Gaudron, have been attacked because in their joint judgment they used the term `unutterable shame' when describing crimes committed against Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They used the phrase in one sentence. The context was this: quite early after settlement, the attitude of some early governors was quite sympathetic towards and cooperative with Aboriginals and there was some, admittedly limited, recognition of Aboriginal land tenure. A century later a much tougher line was taken. The Aboriginals were sometimes described as `vermin' and there was some sympathy for our very own `final solution'. There were campaigns to extirpate them. There are people still living who were involved in the massacres of Aboriginals as late as 1928 in Western Australia. This does seem to be a matter of `unutterable shame'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to face up to the question of the moral responsibility of the white European community for the Third World conditions in which many Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders live. They of course have to take some responsibility themselves too; but they have a dramatically shorter life expectancy than whites, they have high rates of infant mortality and they have a susceptibility to illnesses which are no longer regarded as life threatening for most Australians. That is not to say that we should become paralysed by guilt. We have to examine our collective moral responsibility in context. If we say: are we entitled to feel pride in the achievements of Australians, in the wonderful and heroic things that have been achieved, even where we were not personally or directly involved, I would say yes, we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians generally felt a strong sense of empathy at the return of the unknown Australian soldier from World War I, a sentiment expressed in the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 11 November. I shared that feeling at Villers-Bretonneux at the exhumation ceremony which I attended on 2 November. I did not fight on the Somme in 1918, but I felt pride at the courage of those who did and paid with their lives. So my feeling was both legitimate and vicarious. But, if we are entitled to feel legitimate, vicarious pride at good and great things in our past, what of the bad things, the dark stains? Surely it follows that, if there has been genocide of Aboriginals, forcing tribes off their land, poisoning their waterholes&mdash;events which we have tried to eliminate from our collective memory, matters that are shaming even to recount&mdash;we ought to feel an affliction of the conscience. Pride and guilt are opposite sides of the same coin: we cannot have one without the other. But it is part of our rather slow process of national maturation, of recognising or redefining who we are. I am not into a guilt trip, but I do understand the context of our history, its tenderness and harshness, its shining lights and dark shadows, its pain, grief and bloodshed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill deserves an urgent passage. It is not a perfect bill. We could all think of ways in which it could be improved. I should add too, before I close, that there have been some very important speeches in the course of the debate, including speeches from honourable members of the opposition&mdash;the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge), the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) and the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall)&mdash;who indicated, I thought, very real sympathy not for the form of the bill but for the principles behind the bill. We can all think of ways that the bill can be improved, but it deserves speedy passage, because I think at this stage what would be intolerable would be to have a further period of delay. But the speedy passage of the bill should be followed by careful consultation with the states to ensure that there is a national approach to the issue of native title which does recognise the striking differences in land tenure in each state, both a product of geography and history. To have eight jurisdictions in this complex area&mdash;six states and two territories&mdash;would be intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I close by imploring the two Greens in the other place, if they are listening to this on their crystal sets, to let the bill pass and then play a constructive role in making sure that the legislation works and brings about justice for all and a mood of national reconciliation&mdash;a fresh start in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs.

It is a major industry in Western Australia and Australia-wide. It may not be an industry that contributes the kind of wealth generated by the giant mining companies in our state, but it is without argument one of Australia's most important and thriving industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's Native Title Bill asserts that the legislation would extend to each external territory, to the coastal sea of Australia and of each external territory and to any waters over which Australia asserts sovereign rights under the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973. After all, the concept of terra nullius applied to the ocean in the same way as it applied to the land mass. Furthermore, amongst the bill's many definitions, native title is defined as the communal, group or individual rights or interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in relation to land or waters. Rights and interests are further defined to include hunting, gathering or fishing rights and interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told that native title is derived from traditional laws and customs of indigenous Australians. One of those traditional customs, of course, is fishing. There has been as much talk about sea rights as there has been about land rights in recent years. No doubt this debate will come to the fore again in light of the legislation being discussed in the House in the present few days. This issue has already been highlighted in a report by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> in June this year which described the desire of the Meriam people to claim sea rights following their success in the High Court with the Mabo case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 16 June the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper reported on an address to the Indigenous Peoples' Sea Rights Conference by a law professor from the University of Western Australia, Richard Bartlett. Mr Bartlett warned that `Mabo style native title rights over Aboriginal fishing grounds could be easier to prove than land claims'. Another participant in that conference, Mr David Allen, from the Northern Land Council in Darwin, was reported by AAP as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the response to such recognition will be even more aggressive than the response over native title to lands . . . Not only would commercial fishing interests be affected but it would touch the hearts of all recreational fishermen. There is, in the inland continent of Australia, a deep tradition that the sea and its resources belong to no-one, and that in a curious way the sea is the ultimately enduring terra nullius.</PARA>
<PARA>On 22 October, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> took up the matter in an article entitled, `Sea Rights: Mabo's Second Coming', saying that the commercial fishing industry, which has been largely overlooked in the Mabo debate and which is already under pressure to reduce quotas, licences and conserve fish, was fearful of the notion of indigenous groups exploring their rights to saltwater country. It also referred to the Northern Territory Aboriginal Land Rights Act which allows Aboriginals to fish within two kilometres of their land and provides for sea closures, which have seen amateur and commercial fishing interests unite to fight the applications for closures. The draft report from the Resource Assessment Commission of December 1992, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Coastal zone inquiry</EMPHASIS>, stated in its fourth chapter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the relationship of Australia's indigenous people to the coastal zone is qualitatively different from that of other Australians. It is a relationship based on a tradition of long ownership, stewardship, utilisation and cultural significance.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not propose to argue on that point; rather, I support the traditional usage rights of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and I support Richard Court's Western Australian Land (Titles and Traditional Usage) Bill 1993, which passed through the Western Australia parliament last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Referring back to the report, I am interested to observe the revelation that approximately 120,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people currently live within 20 kilometres of the Australian coastline&mdash;roughly half of Australia's total indigenous population. In Western Australia, more than 20,000 indigenous Australians live within 20 kilometres of the coast&mdash;or 16 per cent of the total population. In the metropolitan areas of New South Wales and Queensland it is true that most of these people are not living traditional lifestyles, although they may well argue that their traditional bond with the land and sea has been maintained. Here I refer to the Dreamtime legend or dreaming tracks which encompass beaches, reefs, oceans and estuaries as the linchpins of special myths about hunting, fishing and gathering. These practices may have ceased in the metropolitan zone and closer regional areas, but as any indigenous Australian would tell us the dreaming is forever; the myths are permanent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is not certain is whether those practices alone can constitute a basis for a native title claim. A more concrete example, however, would be that of the people of northern Western Australia. A great deal of that area is earmarked for land rights claims already. These people continue to rely on the coastal estuarine environments. These areas are of cultural and economic importance as traditional hunting and fishing traditions endure, and the groups' rights of traditional usage should be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other examples. In New South Wales, the Aboriginal Legal Service has already lodged a claim over parts of the state's south coast, and it has foreshadowed more of the same on the northern coast. The Utemorrah claim, which recently went before the Western Australian Supreme Court, seeks sea rights for the deepest oceans beyond the farthest reefs in the north-west of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to statistics provided by the Western Australian Fisheries Department and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, the Western Australian fishing industry in 1992-93 had a total gross production value of more than $366 million&mdash;a very healthy share of the nation's $1.4 billion fishing industry. In Western Australia the fishing industry&mdash;involving fish in the strictest sense of the word&mdash;was worth $22 million. This sum is small fry when compared to our lucrative crustacean, shellfish and mollusc production values of more than $230 million and $33 million respectively. Other forms of aquaculture, including pearling, contributed around $81 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What strikes me as potentially alarming is that two of the most valuable of these species&mdash;abalone and rock lobster&mdash;can be harvested from those reefs which exist in relatively close proximity to the shore. Some key locations are the Abrolhos Islands, Geraldton, Jurien Bay, Cervantes, Lancelin Ledge Point and Fremantle. In general, however, the area stretches from the Murchison River in the north to Bunbury in the south-west. In addition, salmon catches, which are used mostly for canning, yield around 2,000 tonnes per annum with a value of around $1.8 million and constitute a significant proportion of inshore and beach fishing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders may well have hunted and gathered at some point in history from the same areas in which these commercial ventures now base themselves, collecting a rich and diverse range of marine species to complement their staple diet. This tradition is still strong in the Torres Strait Islands, in particular, with many of these people already involved in commercial fishing activities. Again I argue, where the custom is still being practised, the groups' rights of traditional usage ought to be preserved in the legislation, as is the case with the Western Australian legislation proposed by Richard Court and passed last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pressing question which is weighing heavily on the minds of some fishermen is whether these traditions, along with the Dreamtime legends, reasonably constitute the ongoing relationship with the land or sea deemed as being a necessary foundation upon which to lay claim to native title. I am aware that one of Western Australia's most prominent organisations in the fishing industry, the Western Australian Fishing Industry Council, also views the matter with concern and is hoping to clarify the uncertainty as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is certain is that many indigenous Australians have already expressed their concern, as evidenced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Coastal zone inquiry</EMPHASIS> report, about the competition between commercial and subsistence fishing and commercial entry to traditionally owned marine estates. Just what the effect of native title legislation will be in this situation is unclear. If widespread sea rights similar to those found in the Northern Territory's legislation were founded, it would be a blow to commercial fishermen and charter boat operators, who could stand to lose their livelihood if they were lawfully excluded from the area on the grounds that access to these important resources were being granted on a non-discriminatory basis. It would also anger a great many of the recreational fishermen of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Prime Minister stated in his second reading speech that the Native Title Bill would ensure the validity of legislative regimes governing offshore economic activities such as commercial fishing ventures and petroleum exploration, he has not gone as far as to say that those industries themselves would be protected. He has stipulated that environmental and health controls and fisheries regulations will persist to keep native title land fully within the reach of Australian law, but he does not say that the rights of existing commercial fishermen will be protected. Many of these controls are imposed by way of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, which right now can enforce exclusions from fishing areas at any time without compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was never envisaged that this legislation would be used for any purpose other than to meet scientific, biological or environmental access requirements. The fishing industry certainly never envisaged that it may eventually add weight to native title claims, including exclusionary access by Aboriginal groups. The effect of combining this act with the possible claims arising under the native title legislation, which only may confirm existing rights, is a significant worry for the fishing industry, which feels it could be about to lose out in a big way&mdash;a loss that could be without compensation; all in all a double whammy for recreational and commercial fishing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt the real test will come as sea rights battles emerge. Native title legislation can only evoke the same kind of anger from fishermen and associated exporters that it has from mining leaseholders, and pastoralists in some cases. I also argue that Australians are just as passionate about the ocean, perhaps even more so, as they are about the land. It is as integral in our lifestyle as the great Australian dream of owning a family home on a quarter-acre block in the suburbs. I am not simply referring here to a family trip to the beach but to the richness of the ocean's resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>, recognition of sea rights would involve `a conceptual leap for white Australians accustomed to the notion that the sea and its resources are common property over which no-one has priority or exclusionary rights'. I agree strongly that there is a widely held belief that the ocean and its resources are there for the use and enjoyment of all Australians. Where traditional usage of the ocean continues, it should be respected and protected. But, as in the case of mining and pastoral industries, the importance of key industries should be acknowledged to ensure a brighter economic future for Australia. In addition, by leaving land management, including coastal management, in the hands of the states it would be more beneficial for Aborigines to play a greater role in marine resource conservation and management. This would satisfy one of the main concerns&mdash;that indigenous Australians, as traditional users of the land, are not consulted on matters pertaining to fishing and tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, as a Western Australian member of the House of Representatives, naturally I have a considerable amount of concern about the effects of the native title legislation on the opportunity for Western Australia to participate fully through its mining and pastoral industries in the economic recovery of this country. There is an overwhelming opposition in Western Australia to the intent, to the thrust and to the nature of the native title legislation, as proposed by the government. Richard Court's answer to the native title decision by the High Court was to propose his own legislation&mdash;legislation which is being supported by mining, pastoral and other industries within Western Australia as being a sensible answer to the problem of managing the effects of the Mabo native title decision by the High Court and other aspects of land management within the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only urge the Prime Minister on behalf of my constituents, who include a number of commercial and recreational fishermen, that it is imperative that his legislation should not be used to override the legislation of the Western Australian parliament. Land management is a right of the states. I can only tell him that if he tries to override the legislation in the Western Australian state parliament, he will get one of the biggest fights of his political life and, in my view, it will probably be one of the great conflicts of modern political history. If that is the case, it will be a tragedy for Australia&mdash;a tragedy of immense proportions. I can tell the minister who is present at the table, the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker), that in Western Australia there is overwhelming support for the Western Australian legislation and overwhelming opposition to the legislation of the Prime Minister and the party of which he is, of course, a member. </PARA>

The second is to validate titles purchased in good faith by all Australians and corporations in ignorance of native title but rendered invalid by the Mabo decision.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of the peaceful path of reconciliation, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has chosen to take the politically opportunist road of conflict and division.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My distasteful job in this debate is to respond to the opposition's disgraceful and un-Australian amendments to a bill that cries out for bipartisan support. I suppose that we should have realised just how low and despicable the Liberal's approach would be when the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) was appointed shadow spokesman on Mabo. Appointing a man who had publicly reviled our High Court judges for making the decision, and calling for a referendum to reverse it, was not a positive step towards consensus or reconciliation. His jackboot style and intellectual limitations had a most negative impact on the negotiation process. The Opposition's final policy of total opposition to this bill and abdication of responsibility to state governments would come as no surprise to those who listened in horror while the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) labelled Mabo the `guilt industry' and proclaimed Aboriginal people as lesser human beings because they had not invented the wheel. We could only expect the worst from the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), who was supported by his leader in an unprecedented attack on the integrity of our High Court and in making most offensive remarks about Aboriginality. Indeed, the debate has been characterised by the most odious racist comments from the Liberal Party politicians since the abolition of the White Australia Policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a former Liberal Prime Minister, John Gorton, declaring Aborigines to be thoroughly inferior to whites. Marshall Perron, another Liberal leader, also maintained Aborigines to be unworthy because he believed they were unhygienic. Former Liberal leader Bill Hassell stated that the Mabo decision was illegitimate, illogical and racist and that native title represents racial discrimination&mdash;a view echoed by many opposition frontbenchers, including the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) and the honourable member for Barker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Decent Liberals, like Ian Viner and Ian Macphee, distanced themselves from their former colleagues. Fred Chaney condemned the Liberal Party for failing to recognise that Aboriginal people are entitled to some respect and for regarding them as a subspecies. He accused his former colleagues of treating Aboriginal people like kangaroos: seeking to move them on whenever there was a competing use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, it was inevitable that the opposition would oppose this bill root and branch, and would do its best to have it defeated in the Senate. We know that the real reasons relate to the opposition's inherent attitudes of class superiority, its leadership crisis and its desire to appease extreme elements within the mining industry. However, this debate requires us to examine the few phoney reasons that the Leader of the Opposition has advanced in his amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His first amendment argues that there is no need to recognise or protect native title because the High Court has already done that. That is a fatuous proposition because the High Court has periodically changed its opinion on vital issues. Its judgments are not set in cement. Anyway, what has come over the Leader of the Opposition and his redneck crew, who only two weeks ago were crowing in this House about the doctrine of the supremacy of parliament and demanding that we legislate to remove uncertainty in the mining industry? This bill is necessary to express the view of the legislature on a permanent resolution to this great issue and to provide the act of public recognition so necessary to the process of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment argues that the Racial Discrimination Act suffices to protect the interests of native title owners from state and territory governments. It has always been possible for state governments to extinguish native title, if they do so in a non-discriminatory way. The real question here is whether they should be allowed to do what Richard Court's government seeks to do, and that is to extinguish all native title in a racially discriminatory fashion. This is the sort of final solution strategy dear to the hearts of the extreme Right. Indigenous Australians should never forgive the Liberals for opting to complete the process of their dispossession which the High Court so graphically condemned as the darkest aspect of the history of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment represents hypocrisy of the worst kind, particularly in the light of the admission by the Leader of the Opposition that, despite his media protestations to the contrary, the Racial Discrimination Act would be amended if he ever became Prime Minister to ensure the validity of past titles. This amendment is unadulterated cant and deserves to be treated with contempt by this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment argues that land management is entirely a state responsibility. That argument certainly has no validity in fact, nor have the courts ever given it support. Anyway, there is no suggestion in the bill that the Commonwealth government is invading the states' land management responsibilities. Ours is a co-operative scheme. Many of the specific powers of the Commonwealth government have the incidental effect of constraining the way states manage land. The most obvious example is the Racial Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Mabo decision, the High Court allowed the Racial Discrimination Act to intrude into the land management responsibilities of the Queensland government by invalidating a Queensland act extinguishing native title in the Torres Strait. The Franklin Dam case is another example of the Commonwealth government successfully intervening to modify land management in Tasmania. Moreover, Australia's ratification of the international conventions on racial discrimination and the covenant on human rights give us ample scope under the external affairs power to pass this bill. Under this measure, land management will remain a state responsibility but the states will manage native title land according to the principles and guidelines established by the Commonwealth parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth amendment is the most dangerous of all for Australians because it proclaims the false proposition that federal laws are unnecessary to facilitate the validation of past grants. The opposition's about-face on this issue over the last week has been truly breathtaking because, for the past 14 months, along with the mining lobby and the states, it has been vociferously demanding Commonwealth validating legislation and predicting dire consequences if we did not get on with that job. Well, what has changed? What Damascus Road revelation has turned these small-minded conservatives around on this point of law? In three days of debate we have not heard one word of explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's legal advice is that only the federal government can guarantee retrospective validation of past grants. The government's legal counsel are convinced, as are many other eminent lawyers in this country, that the Court bill breaches section 10 of the Racial Discrimination Act and is accordingly invalid. The Leader of the Opposition acknowledges the likelihood of that eventuality because he promises to amend the RDA if the Court bill fails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this bill is lost in the Senate, there would follow a period of great uncertainty and inertia in resource development while the Western Australian act awaits hearing in the High Court.

Financial markets could become very nervous about the status of existing securities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having listened ad nauseam to the mining lobby about sovereign risk, loss of jobs and companies moving overseas, I am stunned that it has now grabbed on to the opposition's coat-tails and decided to gamble all on the validity of the Western Australian bill. Perhaps it believes that our bill will pass anyway. I would imagine that it is now having second thoughts as the Greens hold us all in suspense, indicating that they do not favour this bill because they believe it is pro-mining and disadvantages Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens want us to embark upon an exercise of further consultation with Aboriginal communities around Australia. Having once spent two years on such an exercise, I can tell them that, once initiated, that exercise could end up taking a long, long time. CRA with $1.75 billion at stake on the Cape York peninsular must be beginning to get concerned as to whether it can convince its financial backers that secure title can be achieved. MIM should be feeling concerned about its $300 million investment in the McArthur River mine. Indeed, virtually all prominent mining corporations in the north of Australia will have a king-sized headache if this bill does not become law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having dismissed the Leader of the Opposition's puerile policies, I must now turn to this bill's greatest challenge&mdash;to gain the support of the Western Australian Greens. Like all dedicated environmentalists, I have a great deal of goodwill for the Greens but I must say that, while I do not doubt their sincerity, Aboriginal people must be filled with anguish by their tactics. Some time ago a very decent Liberal came to me with a draft of what the Greens now call their holding bill. I explained then that the bill would be a disaster for Aboriginal people because of its fatal flaws. It is in reality a Trojan horse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first fatal flaw is that it prevents laws passed after 1 July 1993 from extinguishing native title, but not laws already on the states' statute books. Some months ago an attempt by the New South Wales government to use its Crown Lands Act to convert all crown leases to freehold title was narrowly defeated in the upper house. Nothing in the Greens' bill would stop Richard Court taking executive acts permitted under his government's existing laws to convert all unused crown land to freehold, so extinguishing all native title in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second fatal flaw is that it is arguable that a Commonwealth bill which would simply validate, as opposed to modify, the Western Australian Land Titles Act passed through its parliament today is, in effect, a Commonwealth acquisition and must be paid for under the just terms and provisions of our constitution. If this view is correct, the Greens' bill would provide an irresistible incentive for Richard Court to wipe out native title because the Commonwealth government would be paying for the compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third fatal flaw is that the Solicitor-General has expressed the view that the Greens' bill is of doubtful constitutional validity because it would not attract the support of either the race or the external affairs powers. No doubt the legal advisers of the states would be giving them the same advice. The Greens' holding bill should be consigned to the dustbin. Instead of bagging the Aboriginal leaders who are horrified by their position, the Greens should start listening to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that this bill represents a compromise. Miners, pastoralists, state governments and Aborigines all had to give some ground in the lengthy negotiations to produce the bill before the House. However, it was a principled, balanced, workable compromise; an honourable settlement that all Australians will be able to look back on with pride. We do not pretend that this measure is a panacea for the problems of indigenous Australians. It is going to have little immediate effect on those Third World conditions in health, education, housing and employment; that is Australia's shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, like Michael Dodson, I passionately believe that social justice for indigenous peoples will not be achieved by paternalistic authorities simply throwing more goods and services at Aboriginal people, but by the provision of inalienable rights. The High Court's recognition of native title has stirred up a hornet's nest in the bastions of privilege in our nation because it represents a change in thinking that has entirely recast the social landscape of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The human dignity inherent in owning land, so treasured by Australians, can be shared by black Australians. The recognition of their unique identity will inevitably lead to their children enjoying a better life of choice, a better life of opportunity, that has been denied by the pernicious doctrine of terra nullius to previous generations. In achieving dignity for Aboriginal Australians, we also provide for the dignity of all Australians who will find it a lot easier to hold up their heads in pride after this bill becomes law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would urge the opposition to review its position. Those opposite should seek to take a bipartisan approach to this issue&mdash;an issue which, above all others, deserves a bipartisan approach. They should not relinquish responsibility to state governments around this country, but accept, as their predecessors have done in 1975 and at other times, the responsibility that the people of Australia gave this parliament in 1967 by a majority of over 90 per cent&mdash;the highest winning percentage that a referendum has ever had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also urge the Greens in the Senate&mdash;I know there is a great deal of pressure upon them; I know there is a great weight on their shoulders&mdash;to listen to Aboriginal people. If they truly believe, as I think they do, that the interests of Aboriginal people should be advanced and improved by this measure, I urge them to listen to the people who are talking to them, such as the leaders of the Aboriginal communities. I know there are a few Aboriginals within Australia who have a different point of view&mdash;there will always be a few individuals in any community with a different point of view&mdash;but the overwhelming majority of Aboriginal leaders are telling them to get on and pass this bill. I urge them to do so. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I pointed out, there are very material differences between the situation here and that in Western Australia. Firstly, we have had three days of debate here as opposed to one evening's debate in the Western Australian Legislative Council. Secondly, this is not the House of review; this is the legislative house where the government programs its legislation. The bill will proceed from this place to the Senate where it will reside until at least the middle of December and be extensively discussed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the house of review in Western Australia, the Liberal Party keeps justifying its massive malapportionment on the grounds that it has a voting strength of 3 1/2 to 1. It justifies this weighting of rural districts in Western Australia by saying, `We know how to use a house like this. We stand back independent as a house of review. We allow our house of review to deliberate at leisure, unencumbered by guillotines, to consider what is produced by the majority in the governing house&mdash;the governing chamber'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very specific reasons why the Liberal Party, for the first time in the 100 years existence of the Western Australian Legislative Council, moved a guillotine in that place as opposed to its Legislative Assembly&mdash;basically because it has no confidence in the legality and constitutionality of its bill. One of the reasons why we are able to complete this deliberation here is that the government has no amendments to move to its lengthy legislation in the native title area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That contrasts with the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia where the government moved 20 pages of amendments in an attempt to establish some vague level of confidence that, at the end of the day, it might come up with a potable product. Of course, that government has been unable to do that and is, therefore, utterly embarrassed. The last thing it wants with a non-potable piece of legislation is the Legislative Council to pick it apart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that one of the members of that Legislative Council has been suspended for four days and, therefore, is not voting on this occasion. In all probability, were he there we might indeed have some degree of deliberation in that house of review. The great constitutionalists opposite always  tell us about this beloved deliberation&mdash;until it is inconvenient for them to do so. After 100 years of justifying its rotten boroughs in the Western Australian Legislative Council, with its 3 1/2 to 1 malapportionment, the opposition's colleagues in Western Australia are finally and totally exposed for the rottenness they have displayed in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will get another hour or so to debate this bill. Already twice as many people as there are members of the Legislative Council in Western Australia have spoken on this bill in this chamber. There has been very substantial deliberation in this place, and there will be more deliberation in the Senate before this is concluded because we have confidence in this bill; the Western Australian government has no confidence in its legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition completely opposes this declaration of urgency, and we oppose most of all the stench of hypocrisy coming from the other side of the parliament. We oppose the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of this country who had the unbelievable gall at question time today to say that we were trying to gag question time. That was the most blithering piece of hypocrisy we have heard in this parliament today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a couple of weeks ago that man got up in this parliament and wanted us to believe that the Native Title Bill was of monumental importance to the future unity of the Australian community. He laced his second reading speech with exhortations to national unity and to national decency. He asked that all Australians come together and recognise the importance that the Mabo decision represented in the life of this country. He invited all of us to have a sense of our oneness as members of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is the most hypocritical part of this whole debate, because if ever there has been a man who has headed a government, who has been a wounder and a wrecker rather than a healer and a builder, it is the current Prime Minister of Australia. He is the most divisive leader this country has ever had. He is the man who has the urge to spoil all of the parliamentary form, and he is doing it again and again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today he is denying at least eight people on this side of the parliament the opportunity to speak on a piece of legislation. This is the man who talks about unity and decency; this is the man who talks about Australia being a decent place in which to live. If ever there was a person who has tried very hard not to make it a decent place in which to live, it is the current Prime Minister of Australia. By this motion and by his whole handling of this issue&mdash;and it comes to a climax with the jackbooted tactics in the parliament tonight&mdash;he has further divided the Australian community rather than bring it together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have to look any further than a succession of opinion polls on Mabo to realise that his handling of Mabo is rejected by the great majority of the Australian community. On two occasions a poll has shown that that is the situation. Yet the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has the nerve&mdash;and this is the most galling piece of hypocrisy in the exercise&mdash;to say that the Western Australian parliament is running for cover; that the Western Australian government is worried about the constitutionality of its legislation. The Prime Minister ought to worry about constitutionality! If he was so dammed certain of the constitutionality of his bill, why is he retrospectively extinguishing rights of the Western Australian parliament? If he is so certain that his bill will successfully run the gauntlet of the High Court of Australia, why is he retrospectively wiping out rights and wiping out powers of the Western Australian parliament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian government has presented a fair and reasonable bill. If he does not want to believe us on that, he ought to at least believe the word of Sir Ronald Wilson, a former justice of the High Court, a former head of the Uniting Church, the head of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and the deputy chairman of the Council of National Reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final parliamentary atrocity of this little guillotine exercise is that the Leader of the House will not effectively allow any committee stage of debate on this bill. He will not allow any kind of rational examination. It is typical of the jackbooted parliamentary tactics that he and the Prime Minister have used throughout the entire eight months since the last election. If ever there was an example of the authoritarian streak which is the characteristic of this Prime Minister's approach to Australian politics, it has been demonstrated by his divisive and disruptive handling of this issue and by the jackbooted, arrogant tactics he has used to get the legislation through this parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Three electorates cover more than 60 per cent of australia's land mass; the three biggest electorates of kalgoorlie, the northern territory and grey. Many of the potential native claims&mdash;some have already been made&mdash;are in these electorates. The fundamental differences between these electorates and urban electorates are location, lifestyle and outlook.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight, I remember my constituents, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, and my heritage as a regional Australian. I think of the creation of a nation the world has come to know as Australia. I think of the Burma railway, the New Guinea campaign, Gallipoli and those people who fought there and at all other battlefields for Australia. I think of my children and my children's children and the children of Aboriginal heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not underestimate the difficult and great task that confronts us as a parliament in advancing fairness and opportunities for all Australians, particularly Aboriginal Australians and the native title issue. My work on the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and my work in the electorate of Grey have given me a wider experience over recent months. Five per cent of my electorate is Aboriginal land granted by the Tonkin and Bannon governments. That granting of land began 20 years ago. The Arabunna people currently have a native title claim on another 15 per cent of my electorate. Coupled with the World Heritage listing of Lake Eyre, honourable members might begin to imagine how many of these people who have lived in these regions for many generations might feel. Never&mdash;I repeat never&mdash;let it be said that a home on a pastoral lease is not someone else's home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About five per cent of Aboriginal people are potentially able to be beneficially involved with the real intent of the High Court's native title finding. There is one main way that revenue can be created and that is from wealth creation by people creating real development. Access to land in the most sensitive way possible is the main basis of development. Revenue is the main resource from which benefits to Australian society can be sourced. Regional people&mdash;my constituents&mdash;understand this simple reality. My constituents have lived, worked and socialised with each other&mdash;Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal&mdash;for many generations. As regional Australians we are stereotyped and denigrated by many in the media and many of our political opponents. Yet we have been the closest to the Aboriginal people for many generations and we share in many ways some understanding of Australia's urban dominant culture. The comfortable cliches of the ignorant and the politically correct roll off the tongue as many confess that they have had little or no contact with Aboriginal people. In enterprise development, the education and health issues are offered some crocodile tears and almost forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I briefly touch on racism throughout the world. I recently plucked up the courage to ask a black African woman, who had recently emigrated to Australia, about racism. I think she helped me as much as anyone to understand whether I was racist or whether I was somewhere in between various shades of that description when she described to me the racism between tribes and between various groups in her own country. As far as she was concerned, as a black African woman, racism in Australia was negligible in comparative terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my work on the standing committee, it has been my privilege to meet many Aboriginal people throughout Australia and share our mutual concerns. There are some absolutely outstanding and wonderful people and they can only be filled with a sense of positive confidence about our future based on their capacity, commonsense and respect for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great irony to me that no land in urban Australia is under claim, where obviously some of the best land in Australia has been used for development and recreation by the overwhelming number of Australians. Could it be that once again regional Australia has been asked to carry the heaviest load? I give three simple examples. In the Northern Territory, where I understand that 40 per cent of the land is controlled by Aboriginal people, there have been 270 applications for mining and 43 applications have been approved. In the non-Aboriginal lands, there have been 3,000 applications and 2,000 applications have been approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia recently, I had the privilege of travelling through the electorate of Kalgoorlie with the standing committee. The great thing happening in this little town  was that the Aboriginal people had got together with the local authorities and were helping people home from the hotels. That was just a practical little thing and they could not get one dollar of government support. The only support they were getting was from the local government which provided them with a bit of petrol. In my electorate of Grey, I am reminded of the people of the Pitjantjatjara. All they were asking for one day was basic shelter for the elderly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not one Aboriginal constituent of mine has mentioned the native title issue to me in a positive sense. They have approached me about access to Aboriginal land by Aboriginals who are not regarded as part of certain lands. The only public Aboriginal comment I have observed in my electorate is from an Aboriginal who was strongly in favour of one Australia encouraging development for the benefit of all. It could well be that, in practical terms, one of the greatest impediments to Aboriginal enterprise development on their own lands is the indirect tax burden of fuel excise and all other transport costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my maiden speech I proudly mentioned Benno Murray, 103 years of age, an Aboriginal constituent of mine and a veteran of Gallipoli and World War II. I acknowledged the earliest known inhabitants, the Pangkala people in my region and proudly mentioned some of the Aboriginal names which predominate in my electorate. The states are the traditional land title administrators. Many in this parliament would abolish the states. Reconciliation has been occurring for many decades, and for many Australians that will continue in the future. Many other Australians&mdash;non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal&mdash;have reconciled in their own personal way over the generations. The parliament, the executive and the High Court should never presume that in all their deliberations they provides the only answer. I hope that we would never be that arrogant. In the hearts and minds of Australians there is a fairness which makes us amongst the most tolerant democracies in the world. We should never underestimate or undermine the commonsense and goodwill of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our future is what we make it. I am an Australian. Australia is my country. I will always try to serve my country and seek to represent the regional view with the practical experience available to me. I am proud of my heritage in the knowledge that the future always has the potential to be creative. I, from humble beginnings, who can still remember life without electricity, access to only basic education and only one generation removed from the tent and the pug and pine, believe we have many challenges ahead of us which, with strength and practical commonsense, we can overcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am proud to be an Australian and proud to be part of a government which has embraced a strategy which enriches the lives of all Australians, the question of justice for all. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his second reading speech on the Native Title Bill talked about the basic facts of history. To deny them is to deny history. Our past is our present, and our present is our future. For us all it is a matter of acknowledging the past, being part of the present and, more importantly, looking to a future in which all Australians, irrespective of religion, culture or economic substance, are part of this great land and are treated equally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To all of us who grew up in suburban Australia&mdash;as I did in the 1950s&mdash;Aborigines were unknown. We did not meet them, mix with them or know them. Only through our history books did we know something of them; but the history we were reading was British and there was certainly very little about Australia, other than that Australian history started with Captain Cook&mdash;which we now know to be false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not until I went, as a young teacher in 1969, to Mareeba in North Queensland that I was able to see at first-hand that our first Australians were fringe dwellers in their own country. Racism there was rampant. Very few of the children attended school and very few Aboriginal people had any role in the community. That was a product not just of dispossession of the land, but also of dispossession of their identity&mdash;not being part of a community. Having lost the sense of identity and community, those people were pushed to the fringes of our society; and we turned against them and poked our fingers at them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also taught in the Northern Territory for quite a number of years. Those Australians who have not been there or to outback central Australia need to understand that the way some people are living shows us they are Australia's Third World. Part of the problem is land dispossession, people being moved at gunpoint to join others. As I talked to people I learned with horror about their history. While I, as a young student in the 1960s, had been taking part in all sorts of demonstrations, people in central Australia had been rounded up&mdash;not once or twice, but three times&mdash;at gunpoint and taken to Aboriginal settlements because it was believed that would be good for them. It is a very salutary lesson for all of us&mdash;and for me it was a salutary learning experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heart of that is the land&mdash;who one is, the language one speaks, where one comes from and where one is going. If the whole issue of Mabo does not raise these very central and crucial issues for all of us in the community, it has failed. The whole issue in the Mabo debate is the recognition that all Australians should be treated equally. We are all entitled to justice. After all, we are one of the richest countries on earth. Those of us who happen to live in towns and provincial cities throughout Australia have a high standard of living. Yet the very first Australians do not enjoy such benefits. Their health and education have slipped dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mabo and the Native Title Bill do not endeavour to turn those things over and change them overnight but recognise that all of us have to know who we are and where we come from. Those of us who have grown up in families can trace our family trees; the Prime Minister went back to Ireland recently to his own family. For the 40 per cent of Australians who were not born here it is important to know where they come from. Surely for the first Australians it is equally important to know who they are and where they come from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal people of my age are only now beginning to know who their mothers are and where they might have been born. It is horrible. It is unimaginable for those of us who have been cocooned in Australian society that people&mdash;perhaps believing at the time they were doing the right thing&mdash;could have done such horrible things and dragged children screaming from their mothers and so on. We would not allow it now. We cannot change the fact that it happened; but we can accept that it happened and create a society in which it will not happen again and in which everybody will be treated fairly and equally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the whole question of land and the kind of possession people have of it, we all need to understand that the way we possess land and the way we have possessions is viewed somewhat differently by very many in the Aboriginal community. I am reminded of a school in Alice Springs called Yipirinya, a school for children of fringe dwellers. They speak three languages. It started when a group of parents felt that children needed to be able to walk in both cultures. In my electorate, 40 per cent of the people I mix with every day were not born in Australia and their children are more than able to walk in two cultures and two languages. Why is it any less appropriate for first Australians to be able to walk in two cultures and two languages?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Yipirinya school that is exactly what parents set out to do. They believed that language was important. I think all of us would acknowledge that. It enables us to communicate, be informed and imbue a part of culture which is important for all of us. At Yipirinya the children speak three Aboriginal languages and are taught by Aboriginal teachers. Having mastered their own language they move on to English&mdash;a step across. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Models such as that acknowledge that children can grow up bilingual. It is important for us to preserve such models and look at things in a very different light. People on the other side of this House sometimes seem to think it is perfectly acceptable for us to have community languages for people who come from Italy, Romania, Israel, Iran, Greece, Turkey, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia or any of the other 148 countries which Australians now come from. It is somehow acceptable for them to preserve their own language. The government provides funding for those community language programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it seems that our first Australians should not and must not preserve, develop and work with their own language. Language is part of the tie to the land. It defines where they live and the groups in which they move. Some languages, because they are spoken by very small groups of people, are very sophisticated. I can think of one language group which has 14 forms of address, depending on whom one is speaking to. Some of us would find this extremely difficult. We are not talking about the historical view of simple people doing simple things, but about people who have a very sophisticated understanding of their environment and whose relationships with each other, and those developed through their language, at times are incredibly complicated and sophisticated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tied into this legislation are all those kinds of things which are very much about Australia and Australians, about who we are and where we are going. We have heard a lot of talk about the relationship between Aboriginal communities and pastoralists, pastoralists and mining companies and of all of those groups to government and to the Australian populace in general. Somehow, it has always been deemed to be all right for pastoralists who acquired land in all sorts of ways to achieve respectability but that that is not all right for those people who were there and had land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is room in this great land for all of us&mdash;pastoralists, mining companies and certainly the very first Australians. There has to be room because we are all here as part of a great democracy which is committed to justice&mdash;justice for each and every one of us, irrespective of who we are and where we come from. It is somewhat frightening to hear people talk about the need for further discussions and debate. Indeed, it is said that perhaps some people do not understand the nuances of legislation. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that almost all of the laws and legislation passed in this House often is not understood by the vast majority of the Australian populace and, I would hasten to add, sometimes not even by some of the honourable members in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I hear people suggest that groups should travel through northern Australia to discuss legislation with isolated communities, I wonder what kind of paternalism or view of the world they have. I find it quite extraordinary. It is also quite ridiculous, given that northern Australia is currently in the middle of the wet season. One would find it difficult to travel through that countryside at present. This is apart from the fact that the first language of very many people there is not English. Once again we see a kind of paternalism: it is all right for us to tell people what to do if they happen to be Aboriginals who obviously could not understand or would not know about the legislation. I would have hoped that the Australian community would have moved further down the track to raise issues of fairness, concern and justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government speaks for all Australians. It consults with organisations and groups in the communities. We talk to people. We do not talk to each and every person we know. A member in this House represents on average 70,000 people. We do not discuss issues on every piece of legislation with each and every person in the community, but we do go out and talk to people. We have a sense of what people think, feel and know. The same thing has happened in consultations with this Native Title Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heart of the legislation is a High Court decision. I find it quite extraordinary that people are now suggesting that we should be having a referendum on this High Court decision. We do not have referendums at the end of murder trials and we do not ask people whether they agree with particular court decisions. At times there have been court decisions which very few of us have agreed with. There have been some recent cases where judges have made comments about women and about the way women have been treated. While there were outcries, there were certainly no calls for referendums on those court findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to be bound in this democracy by the rule of law, then we must abide by the High court's decision. It has ruled quite simply on the law of native title. For those of us who abide by the law, the law is the law. People who do not like this decision may not like other laws, but we have not heard them calling for referendums on those. This nonsense that somehow the rule of law applies in some instances but not in others seems somewhat absurd. I find it even more extraordinary that the people who purport to uphold the rule of law&mdash;the more conservative groups in our society&mdash;suddenly find that, when the law is not to their liking, it is somehow defective. They cannot have it both ways. At the heart of this Native Title Bill is the issue of the rule of law and, more importantly, the translation of that law into action. Quite properly, that is what governments and democracy are about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had many discussions on the government's application of this law. Sure, not everybody is happy, but not everybody is happy every day of the week with the laws that are made. Honourable members, sitting in their offices, hear people complain about the laws as they pertain to a whole range of issues&mdash;social security legislation, the local CES office, a whole range of educational policies, health policies, defence policies or any other kinds of policies. But, quite properly, people are elected to make laws, they are elected on policy platforms and they are elected on questions of a philosophical basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This great party, at its core, at its heart, has always stood for a sense of justice, equality and equity. Nowhere are those principles more clearly shown and defined than in the translation of the High Court finding on Mabo into this Native Title Bill. It has shown that each of us in Australia has a role to play in questions of social justice and in determining the present and the future; that each of us needs to look to our past and to our history&mdash;not to deny it, not to pretend it did not happen, nor to feel guilty about it. It is not a question of guilt but simply an acknowledgment of the fact that these dreadful, degrading, outrageous, wicked things happened to individuals in our community. Many of us who stood by did not know they were happening or did not care or simply thought they would all go away. Those things do not change, but with this Native Title Bill there is an acknowledgment that they are part of our history. Social justice, the question of the acquisition of native land title, the issue that Aboriginals were the first Australians, that they are very much part of modern Australia and that they bring with them a very long history, a proud culture, a wealth of languages, music and art are all things which together make for a very diverse and very interesting Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We pride ourselves on being enormously multicultural. What greater success can we have than bringing about a reconciliation of those very first Australians with modern and multicultural Australia so that, together, we can work to build a proud and just society. The economic benefits that European settlement has brought to enormous numbers of us through education, health programs and freedom enable us to participate in this great society and great democracy. Through this Native Title Bill we will see justice for all. It will be a first step along that path. All of us look back on a past of which we are not proud but which we can no longer deny. We look forward to a great future when Australians can hold their heads high in a just and free society in which the first Australians can be recognised for who they are and what they were&mdash;the first Australians. </PARA>

Yet before dinner we saw the extraordinary circumstance that the opposition and this House are to be denied full and frank debate on this matter. Worse still, we are to be subject to not being able to examine the bill clause by clause in the committee stage, which is what such an important bill demands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also interesting to hear the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) talk about how the High Court decision has to be accepted and about the futility of putting it to a referendum. Yet only a few years ago the High Court, in a similar case known as the Bushell case, found in favour of a veteran being able to receive certain pension entitlements because of a certain circumstance&mdash;and immediately the department and this government acted to try to reverse that court decision. So it is a lot of humbug for the government to come in here and talk in terms of a High Court decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also humbug for the government to suggest that the opposition is doing other than agreeing with the decision. We agree with the decision because, after all, the decision was that native title exists. In the amendment we recognise that there is native title. We also recognise, through that decision, that compensation has to be paid. That is quite all right. We also look at it from the point of view that it was a decision made for the Murray Islands in the Torres Strait and that it was a discrete case on which the judgment was made. To suggest that we can take that case onshore and apply it in that form is not nonsense, but there will be difficulties in implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we find wrong with this particular legislation is that it goes far beyond the Mabo decision and sets up an elitist situation in which many people in Australia will be disadvantaged. I speak here from the point of view that my electorate of Dawson has 3,224 indigenous Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders&mdash;the 17th greatest amount of any electorate in Australia. I also have in my electorate South Sea Islanders, who are not included in that figure. They are classed as ordinary Australians, and, at 3,500, number more than the indigenous people. These people have been denied and deprived for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 30 or 40 years, Australia has seen a revelation in the manner in which whites and blacks in this country have come together. There has been reconciliation. The Aborigines have been able to retain their traditions and customs and yet act as Australians. Now we have this bill which, unfortunately, I believe is not going to do anything at all for those people who have been underprivileged, including my South Sea Islanders; they will not benefit from this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that two claims from my electorate are currently before the High Court. They have the prospect of removing any certainty of investment and any certainty of tenure until they are heard. Those are two cases from my electorate alone. Goodness knows what the number is right throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Uncertainty was created by the decision in the first place. We have to admit that. I came across further evidence of uncertainty when at a seminar today I met a representative of one of the mining giants of Australia, Mount Isa Mines, who said that the company has the capacity to produce the gross domestic product of Australia in just one week. In other words, it provides one-fiftieth or two per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. It is also looking at the marvellous investments that could still be made if there were certainty, but it is plagued with this uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest and best mining companies in Australia has said that, with this uncertainty, there is no chance of people being prepared to risk capital, and so investments cannot be financed. It is interesting that this mining company is in the state of Queensland. We heard the Premier of that state, Mr Goss, loudly disclaim some of the earlier moves that were made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this regard and force certain actions on him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather interesting that we have been told we have not got time to debate this bill in full. It has been only within the last month&mdash;even less than a month&mdash;that any definition has been given to the manner in which it might be transacted. The Prime Minister has made backflips of a standard for which he could have received an Olympic gold medal without much trouble at all. He has changed positions from one to the other, and now is saying, `Time for discussion has passed. Let's get on with it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at some of the statistics that have been brought forward from very recent polls. Of the 1,200 people polled around Australia, 76 per cent said that people should be treated equally in terms of land title, with 20 per cent supporting different rights for native title holders. From these statistics we can see the level of concern among people about this legislation and the Mabo decision. Eighty-six per cent of those polled would be concerned if existing property titles of other Australians were put at risk; 85 per cent would be concerned if employment opportunities were reduced; 82 per cent would be concerned if economic development were delayed; 81 per would be concerned if mining investment were discouraged; and 78 per cent would be concerned if the Mabo decision resulted in large areas of Australia being claimed under native title by Aboriginal people. That is what the people of Australia are talking and thinking about. For us to think that after three or four weeks we know everything and are prepared to transact this now is beyond belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that Mr Goss came into this argument roaring like a lion. But, although his state probably is second only to Western Australia in terms of how much it has to lose under this legislation, nothing is being said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still talk amongst people that a referendum should be called on this subject. I happen to agree with that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in that we do recognise native land title; there is no need for any further legislative action; and any legislative action should rest with the states, not the federal government. I have never believed in centralisation of these types of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this legislation is an overkill for one particular reason: the government has a guilt complex and has tried to rush into this. It is not a guilt complex that I share. This legislation is an overkill and I am certain that further decisions of the High Court will be required to interpret it&mdash;and, goodness knows, there are a lot of people who have some doubts about the first decision. To say that we are going to commit further decisions to the High Court in this matter is beyond belief. It will be an absolute bonanza for the legal fraternity if these things are argued backwards and forwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate a lot has been said by the government about Richard Court's legislation in Western Australia. I have to say that Richard Court has it right. He recognises native title and has moved to make sure that the leases already granted are validated. But he then turns immediately and says that, if a lessee leaves and a compensation claim is lodged, it will be taken through the courts and just compensation given. That is a fair flow which will give certainty to industry to keep going, knowing that the only impairment will be compensation paid at the other end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation fouls up that certainty. We now have a dual train of application that will stymie applications for mining or any other types leases into two courts, and it will be a month of Sundays before any decision whatsoever is made. If people took the hype out of this argument and looked at what was there, they would agree that perhaps we are looking at something that is more of an overkill than anything else and that we should be trying to improve and build on the past 30 years in which, as I have said, there has been great reconciliation with the Australian people. We should try to build on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, as I understand it, within the context of this debate, people have taken the opportunity to cast racist slurs. I remember a question I was asked by a colleague of mine about Aboriginality. A lot of people want to know what Aboriginality is. Also, in the context of this bill, they want to know what tribality is&mdash;how long a person has belonged to a tribe and accepted the traditions of that tribe. As far as I know, the bill is entirely silent on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the original application of `Aboriginality', as I understand it, if I were accepted by an Aboriginal community and were prepared to accept Aboriginal ways and live with that Aboriginal community, I could be classified as an Aboriginal. I believe that definition&mdash;not only of `Aboriginality' but also of `tribality'&mdash;is very important and should have been considered in the preparation of this bill. Instead, there will be great confusion, unnecessary delay and controversy as these things are decided through court channels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking about racial implications, it is important to remember the claim made by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) in his speech yesterday. He claimed that 99 per cent of the land owned by blacks in Queensland is reserve land, yet 90 per cent of the people on those reserves are not indigenous to those areas. Imagine what will happen with a claim for native title when the indigenous 10 per cent are recognised. What is going to happen to the 90 per cent who are not indigenous?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people care to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, question No. 717, which I put on notice, sets out in quite vivid detail the difficulties that exist within my own electorate where members of one tribe of Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders are fighting against others. It is the old saying about `divide and rule'. Those problems exist in our present society. How much more racial will things be for the 10 per cent who have a land claim when 90 per cent do not? Goodness knows where this will end up. That sort of situation should have been looked at. There are also real problems in Ayr, where racial tensions are greater than ever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, because the time for debate has been cut short, we will not have any significant time in which to debate the major issues. However, I want to say that I am concerned about government funds being made available for the acquisition of land. I am worried about the level of compensation; there is no figure on that. I am concerned about access, not only to land, but also to sea frontages and offshore areas and about who will have access to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, I support the amendments because they are realistic. They put power back where it belongs&mdash;the states&mdash;and allow the Commonwealth to come in as an assistant and not a hindrance to what is proposed by them.

I appreciate all the help I have had from Mr Cox and I am embarrassed that I find myself, through my own stupidity, in a position where I cannot do as I have so often stated I would. I know that this has caused embarrassment to Mr Cox and I deeply regret that. But, quite clearly, it is my own fault and no blame attaches to Mr Cox in any way, for I know that he has gone out into the community, seeking support for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have painted myself into a corner whereby, if I do not vote for this legislation, I will be expelled under rule 7 of the Labor Party, thereby invoking all the plenary powers. While I am sure that Labor Party rules are like the law in general&mdash;the embodiment of everything that is excellent; it has no fault or flaw&mdash;I find that they are something of a movable feast. On the occasion of the ATSIC legislation I was actually asked by the then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs not to vote; rather, I was to be given the opportunity to speak. It is the reverse on this occasion: I have the opportunity to speak but I am compelled to vote. I do not fear my expulsion; it would be a situation into which I got myself. However, it would be very embarrassing for people in Western Australia, some of whom have supported me for 20 years, and would hand a victory to elements in the Labor Party in Western Australia who, for a long time, have been seeking my expulsion. I do not intend to give them that privilege; nor do I intend to resile from this fight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, at the best, this is silly legislation; at the worst, it is desperately dangerous legislation. The bill is certainly very complex and difficult to understand. Let me give an example which will show that neither the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) nor the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker) understand the bill. Both ministers have made reference to my having a conflict of interest because I hold shares in a mining company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My shares in Cambridge Gulf are well documented; they were declared in my pecuniary interest schedule on 18 August, very shortly after I bought them. That mine has tremendous potential. I believe that it will provide employment to Aboriginal people in Wyndham and earn billions and billions of dollars in exports for this nation. But this mine is in the sea&mdash;a dredging operation&mdash;a fact that both ministers should have known because all ministers were briefed on this matter. Because that mine is in the sea it is not affected by this legislation because clause 25(i)(ii) limits the operation of this bill to the low water mark. There never was and never could be a conflict of interest. It is clear that either the ministers did not know this&mdash;which means that they did not understand the bill&mdash;or they were being reprehensible and irresponsible with the truth. That is something that they will have to decide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let there be no doubt, the complexity of this bill will inevitably lead to litigation and delays as we seek out who has title and who has not. I have anthropological and ethnological advice from Western Australia which says that it is possible, under the terms of the High Court decision, that nobody will be entitled to native title&mdash;not one single person would succeed. However, that would not stop the litigation and the inevitable costs that would flow from it&mdash;costs which would be borne by the taxpayers.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, while we pay the costs of those who are litigating, people defending themselves will find it much harder to meet their costs. It is true that there is a clause in the bill which says that money can be made available for this defence; but, believe me, it will be very hard to get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objections from the Aboriginal people I speak to, I think, are fairly sound. They say that, under the present regime, they can negotiate with mining companies at their own pace. Now they will be hurried. There are schedules to be met. They say that some companies, unethically, will obfuscate, delay and force them into arbitration. I think this is quite conceivable; it could happen. There is no doubt that the process is going to be complex. It is going to set Aboriginal against Aboriginal, black against white, and black against black and white&mdash;there is no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say here and now that I believe the High Court ruling was irresponsible. It was a ruling from a rogue High Court. But let us look at what was actually said. One judge, Mr Justice Dawson, got it right. He said that native title existed but it had no status in law. I think that was a very accurate description. Three judges said that it applied to the Murray Islands; three judges said it applied also to the mainland. So in terms of judges saying it applied to the mainland, there was a four to three decision saying it did not. Yet we have seen the government rush into legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The common law is not about social justice; the common law is about the good governance of a country. If we make the common law a vehicle for social justice, we are going to run into enormous difficulties because what is just for one will be unjust for another. I believe common law should be changed only very gradually. It should be a process of evolution. But here we have a High Court that has stood it on its head. For 200 years we have had fixed law and the High Court stands it on its head. A responsible government would have said, `Thank you, your honours'&mdash;and then legislated to extinguish native title, as we thought it was already extinguished, and paid compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Shock! Horror!', I hear. The truth is that native title has been extinguished for most of Australia and for most Aboriginal people. It would be entirely equitable to extinguish it completely and agree to pay the compensation. If the compensation were paid according to the High Court terms, the payout would be negligible. The costs to the taxpayer would be negligible. There would be no time delay because things would go on without the inhibitions that will now obtain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that I have supported Richard Court. In fact, what Richard Court has done is follow the recommendations I made long before the Western Australian parliament came to its decision. I think Court is in fact wrong to give any form of title. We should simply have stopped at eliminating it and paying the compensation. This is a view that has wide support from Aboriginal people because they do not want other Aboriginals making claims on their land. My communities are saying now that they are going to put into their constitutions bans on any more excisions on their properties. They are going to change their constitutions to lock up voting in their communities so that outsiders cannot interfere, because they fear the influence of other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also fear the legislation for other reasons. They believe the money that the government has said it is going to allocate for its social justice pact&mdash;a sum so far undeclared; a sum which the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) says we will need additional taxes to pay&mdash;is going to be paid through ATSIC and, we are told, through other Aboriginal organisations, for which we read `land councils'. My Aboriginal people know that if this is the case they will not benefit from the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is $2 billion a year going into the Aboriginal industry today. The Aboriginal people are not the beneficiaries of this money, and they know it. If there is to be any social justice in this nation it should be in the proper application of that $2 billion. This is what Aboriginal people want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a few words to say about racism. Very early in my career in this House&mdash;in about 1982&mdash;I served on the Aboriginal affairs caucus committee. It was a fairly tedious task. We had a visit from some Aboriginal people from Sydney who were concerned about the Aboriginal Arts Board and what they saw as the illegal use of $2 million&mdash;there was $2 million missing. After listening for a while, I said, `If half of what you say is true, some of these people should be in gaol'; whereupon the chairman, former Senator Ruth Coleman, jumped up and said, `I'm sick of your racist statements. You can't put these people in gaol. They're Aboriginals'. I said, `I don't care whether they're Aboriginals. If they're crooks, they should be in gaol'. To a person, this Aboriginal group jumped up and said, `That's what we think'. That senator's statement was the most racist and the most patronising that I had heard in a long time. The word `racism' is bandied about today. It is used to humiliate and to try to stop people expressing a point of view. I have devised a description of a racist: a racist today is anyone who wins an argument with a multiculturalist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is going to cause enormous conflict. If we had goodwill and reasonable people, it is possible that the bill could work. I remember when the Northern Territory land rights legislation was put through. The minister concerned assured people that not more than 10 per cent of the land would be claimed. Look at the map today. The truth is that there are no people of goodwill out there; there is no goodwill in the Aboriginal industry. They have an insatiable appetite and that appetite is for power; it is for sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stood for election in 1980. I toured the Kimberleys in 1979 and I was advised to talk to an influential Aboriginal person attached to the Kimberley Land Council. He told me he would go out and support me if I was prepared to back sovereignty&mdash;an independent black state in the Kimberleys. I told him where to get off. I read him the riot act and I said I would not have a bar of it. As it turned out, the state government had an election two weeks before the federal election. The Aboriginal people voted at the state election and they did not bother about the federal election. So the outcome was indecisive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal people say to me that they are frightened of sovereignty. They know. They hear these stories. They do not want a black state. They say, `We are Australians. We want to be part of Australia. We don't want what other Australians don't get'. That is not a view we get in the cities. These are Aboriginal people out there trying their damnedest to make things work. They are being inhibited by the operations of ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have criticised ATSIC before. It is a bureaucracy of monstrous size. When we scrapped the Department of Aboriginal Affairs it was monstrously overstaffed in Canberra. It had about 125 employees. Now there are over 600. What should have happened is that we should have put people out into the state capitals and then out into the provinces. We did not do this. We have created this monster bureaucracy which gobbles up money at an unprecedented rate and seems to actively deny Aboriginal people the ability to become self-sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I only wish that I was in the position of stormy Normie Foster in relation to this bill. If my vote would make a difference, I would cross the floor on this legislation. But, unfortunately, it does not make a difference. It is more important, I believe, that I stay within the Labor Party to counter those existing elements which I think are very destructive; those elements which I understand have been rejoicing in Western Australia about my imminent demise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the end of the story by a long way. We have not yet got this legislation through the Senate. It may be possible that, for once in their lives, the Greens will do something useful. If they can lock this up in a committee for any length of time, I believe public opinion will steamroll this bill and it will be consigned to the garbage bin of history where it belongs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel extremely humiliated about the statements I have made. I have had to make these judgments and I make them on behalf of the people who have supported me, not on my own behalf. It is a humiliating experience. I think those who know me would have to concede that I am generally a person of my word. In this case, I have certainly proved to be less than that. It is with no pride at all that I will be sitting on this side of the House in the division. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to parliament: redevelopment of CSIRO site at Prospect, New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed work, recommended by the public works committee, involves the redevelopment of a site at Prospect, New South Wales, for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO. The project is consistent with the CSIRO's accommodation strategy which aims to progressively consolidate CSIRO research activities on a limited number of sites within major regional centres to facilitate collaborative research, share scarce and costly resources, and reduce operating costs and overheads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project involves the construction of a 2,200 square metre, two-storey laboratory and administration building; a 500 square metre animal house and associated yards; a research laboratory-amenities building, and poultry sheds in a compound providing a facility for poultry research; a 250 square metre, 126-seat lecture theatre; extensions to the existing library and post mortem building; alterations and upgrading of existing buildings; and associated demolition, roadworks, car parks, landscaping and site services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in July 1993. The committee tabled its favourable report on 17 November last recommending the redevelopment at an estimated cost of $11.6 million at August 1992 prices. In addition, the committee recommended that the government give consideration to transferring the Wool Research Development Corporation's equity in the site at Prospect to CSIRO. I thank the committee for its report and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The proposed work, recommended by the public works committee, involves the upgrading of Mount Wellington broadcasting facilities in Hobart, Tasmania, for the National Transmission Agency. The project is consistent with the aims of the National Transmission Agency to provide the public with ongoing access to reception of the television and radio services of the ABC and the SBS, and providing capacity for the introduction of new services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal involves construction of a tower consisting of a 70-metre tapered concrete shaft supporting a 60-metre steel frame upon which is mounted several transmission antennas and a protective fibreglass radome. The work also includes alterations and upgrading of the existing transmitter building, demolition of the existing broadcasting tower, ancillary towers and masts and related site rehabilitation works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in August 1993. The committee tabled its report on 18 November last recommending the development at an estimated cost of $13.095 million in September 1993 prices. The National Transmission Agency has noted the committee's recommendations and provides the following comments. The NTA has discussed the use of VHF or UHF transmission with Tasmanian Television and on several occasions has offered the company an agreement to share facilities on the new tower using a VHF or a UHF channel. Tasmanian Television has so far declined to accept these offers. In addition, the NTA is also consulting with the company concerning sharing facilities at other NTA sites in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NTA also agrees with proposals made by the Hobart City Council, and is developing an environmental management plan in consultation with its contractor for the Mount Wellington project, Telecom Australia's broadcasting division, which incorporates the principles developed and put forward by the council in discussion with the agency.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to parliament: partial refurbishment of stage 1, Commonwealth Centre.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed work, recommended by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, is the partial refurbishment of stage 1 Hobart Commonwealth Centre for Australian Estate Management of the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services. The total area proposed for refurbishment is approximately 4,600 square metres of net lettable space, comprising five upper floors, floors 9 to 13, part of the ground floor, and the upgrade of base building services&mdash;mechanical, electrical and fire protection&mdash;including the removal of asbestos from the 14th floor plant room at an estimated total cost not exceeding $8.3 million. The project is expected to take at least 10 months to complete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The refurbished accommodation is to be leased to the Departments of Social Security, the Arts and Administrative Services and Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, together with the National Media Liaison Service and the Merit Protection and Review Agency.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in July 1993. The committee tabled its report on 16 November 1993 and has recommended the refurbishment proceed at an estimated total cost of $8.3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report the committee made a number of recommendations which I will comment on as follows. Firstly, that floors one to nine be refurbished as part of this proposal. In August 1991 the government approved the development of cost estimates and detailed design for the refurbishment of the entire stage 1 building. Later investigations established that a refurbishment of the entire building was not viable due to insufficient tenant interest for vacant space. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1992, a reduced scope of refurbishment work was agreed by the government, subject to tenant commitment, to occupy the refurbished space. Negotiations are continuing with several Commonwealth government agencies with a view to obtaining in-principle commitment to lease vacant accommodation in the stage 1 Hobart Commonwealth Centre upon expiration of their current leases in privately owned accommodation. Once this commitment has been obtained, Australian Estate Management will be in a position to seek funding for the refurbishment of floors one to nine. It is considered inappropriate to commit scarce funds and resources to refurbish the remaining vacant floors before first obtaining commitment from tenant departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, that the Minister responsible for the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services review the policy relating to the provision of office accommodation for Commonwealth departments. The management of the Commonwealth's real estate portfolio has undergone significant changes in recent years. In particular, the management of the Commonwealth office estate has been commercialised, with departments and agencies being responsible for the payment of rent for their occupation of Commonwealth owned office accommodation. Whilst the government has benefited through the freedom and autonomy granted to individual departments and agencies in their property decision making, it is recognised that there is a need to regularly review and assess the effectiveness of the property reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the 1993-94 budget deliberations, it was agreed that AEM, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, should review the financial and operational arrangements pertaining to the management of the Commonwealth's investment in real estate. The review will examine funding arrangements, reporting requirements, the impact of public sector reforms, the commercialisation process, the impact of private sector competition and optimum strategies for meeting the government's policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review is under way currently and has been staged to enable the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services to report to the government by the end of this year on the appropriateness of current funding and reporting arrangements for the office estate. Stage 2 of the review will be undertaken during 1994 and will examine all areas of the Commonwealth estate and the organisational structure of Australian Estate Management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, that Australian Estate Management conduct an audit to assess the effectiveness of the comprehensive energy management strategy. An audit will be implemented on all refurbished floors to measure energy usage commencing approximately 12 months after occupation. The data obtained from this audit will be used to assess the actual building performance against the predetermined energy targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, that Australian Estate Management continues consultations with the Nursing Mothers Association. AEM is continuing consultations with the Nursing Mothers Association to ensure its requirements for nursing mothers rooms within the Hobart Commonwealth Centre are satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, that Australian Estate Management re-examine the provision of toilets for disabled persons. The total number of disabled person toilets proposed is above that required by the building code of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian Estate Management will, however, re-examine the provision of toilets for disabled persons and determine whether the number could be increased. I thank the committee for its report and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The proposed work, recommended by the Public Works Committee, involves the rationalisation of inner-Melbourne accommodation, RIMA, for the Department of Defence. The RIMA project involves the refurbishment of buildings located within the Victoria Barracks precinct in St Kilda Road, Melbourne. The upgrading of accommodation within the precinct is one major element of a larger capital facility project directed at rationalising defence owned and leased property assets in the inner-Melbourne area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project involves major refurbishment of buildings A, B, C, D, G and H to provide approximately 30,000 square metres of good quality commercial office accommodation, fully airconditioned with communications and data reticulation to individual work spaces throughout. The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in July 1993. The committee tabled its report on 17 November 1993 recommending the redevelopment at an estimated cost of $27 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Defence has noted the committee's recommendations and provides the following comments. Victoria Barracks is Commonwealth owned. In the case of the residual space to be accommodated by the defence element in the inner-Melbourne area, the selection of a preferred option will depend on the outcome of market opportunities available to Defence at the time of negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prototype workstation layout has generally been well received. A number of lessons have been learnt since its introduction. Further analysis of the size and configuration is proposed to ensure that defence elements are accommodated without compromising work function or efficiency, but at the same time achieving maximum utilisation of space available. Discussion with relevant unions in regard to the utilisation of the workstation relative to individual buildings is proposed in the coming weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A meaningful dialogue is being developed with the Heritage Commission to ensure that heritage sensitivities throughout the refurbishment program are respected. Defence has engaged a heritage expert to protect its interests and those of the commission throughout the development.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence has also agreed to the committee's recommendation regarding the provision of recreational/leisure sporting facilities. Given the predominant younger, more athletic conscious work force, defence is keen to achieve an efficient working environment with due regard for recreational/leisure sporting facilities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill follows on from the changes to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 which were passed by the parliament during the autumn sittings earlier this year and more recently at the commencement of the current budget sittings. It gives effect to the remaining major changes to the act that are necessary to implement the totality of the reform package flowing from the commission's review of the operation of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in this bill, together with those which have already received assent, establish a leaner, tighter and more effective organisation, with devolved decision making going hand-in-hand with improved accountability. As a result, ATSIC's ability to provide a vehicle for indigenous self-determination becomes even more firmly established. As we have seen in the last few weeks, that means ATSIC's evolution as an organisation able not only to manage Commonwealth programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities but also to negotiate on policy with an independent and forceful political voice. This bill provides, in essence, for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">major changes to arrangements for the Torres Strait, including the establishment of a Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">streamlining the financial provisions of the act, one of the effects of which will be to facilitate the further devolution of authority to regional councils;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">strengthening the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">establishing an independent electoral review panel. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will recall that, when the second package of amendments was introduced at the commencement of the current sittings, it was foreshadowed that a further bill encompassing these further reforms would be introduced during these sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This third package of amendments, like those introduced earlier this year, flow from recommendations contained in the commission's report to me on the operation of the act. These amendments, which build on the reforms already agreed to by parliament, will further enhance the representative nature of the organisation, strengthen the role of the regional councils as the linchpins of empowerment for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and reinforce the commission's established commitment to high standards of scrutiny and accountability. The reforms are based on the government's commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-determination and our confidence in indigenous people managing their own affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the major provisions of the present bill and in doing so I draw to honourable members' attention that the bill is large and it is not possible to set out in great detail many of the changes. Those that are of a substantive nature I will deal with more fully. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Office of Evaluation and Audit</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill substantially widens the powers of the Office of Evaluation and Audit, increasing the ability of the minister and the commission to have examined the financial management of ATSIC funded organisations. It provides for an expansion in the functions of the Office of Evaluation and Audit to include the evaluation and audit of the operations of Aboriginal Hostels Limited, the Commercial Development Corporation, and the proposed Torres Strait Regional Authority, as well as the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, the bill includes provision to enable the minister and the commission to direct the Office of Evaluation and Audit to investigate the operations of regional councils, in addition to the above bodies, and in certain cases, ATSIC and Torres Strait Regional Authority grant and loan recipients. Provision is also made for the Director of Evaluation and Audit to have greater powers to examine documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also includes a number of clauses relating to the Director of Evaluation and Audit amendments, including provision for the period of appointment, remuneration and allowances, leave of absence, disclosure of interests, resignation, termination of appointment of the Director of Evaluation and Audit, aligning these with similar provisions for other full-time statutory office-holders under the principal act. Provision is also made for an acting director and for the director to be immune from personal liability in an action or other proceeding for damages in relation to anything done in his or her official capacity. These provisions are largely administrative in nature and serve to correct an anomaly in the existing act. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Chief Executive Officer</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the period of appointment of the chief executive officer by setting a maximum period of appointment rather than a minimum. This is in accordance with standard appointment provisions in most legislation establishing statutory appointments. It also requires the chief executive officer to report his or her interests to the commission chairperson rather than the full board of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Advisory Committees</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill includes amendments relating to membership of advisory committees and the members of the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments relating to Regional Council Administrators</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provision is made in the bill to set the terms and conditions for an administrator to hold office. This was omitted from the principal act and is largely an administrative matter. The provisions include full-time appointment consistent with the move to full-time regional council chairpersons, disclosure of interests, resignation, leave of absence, and suspension and termination of appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the government's commitment to greater self-determination and self-management, provision has been made for the commission rather than the minister to appoint administrators. Provision is also made for an acting administrator and for the commission to appoint a replacement administrator if there is a vacancy in an office of the administrator. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Commercial Development Corporation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of amendments relating to the Commercial Development Corporation. These are largely technical in nature and tidy up the principal act to bring it more into line with current drafting procedures. The bill provides for at least one director to be an ATSIC commissioner, for the period of appointments not to exceed five years, and for the termination of appointment of a director of the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Taxation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill includes provision for exempting ATSIC from the payment of excise duty which would otherwise be payable by the commission, or by any other person, on goods that are for use by the commission. The current arrangement whereby ATSIC is required to pay excise duty is inconsistent with other government agencies and it is only reasonable that the act be amended to bring the organisation into line with other Commonwealth departments and agencies. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Aboriginal Hostels Ltd</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that AHL is not a statutory organisation established under the principal act but a company funded through ATSIC. The government considers that it is essential that AHL be subject to the same level of scrutiny and accountability and to the same administrative review mechanisms as ATSIC. Provisions are included in the bill to this end. Honourable members will note that the bill before them includes provision for division 2 of part XI of the Audit Act 1901 to apply to Aboriginal Hostels Ltd and that certain decisions of an administrative character made at the director level are made subject to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Secrecy Provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interests of privacy and in recognition of the very sensitive personal information that may become available to certain office holders within ATSIC, the government has agreed with the commission's proposal that section 90 of the principal act be extended to apply to the Director of Evaluation and Audit, a member of the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board, a regional councillor, a member of an advisory committee established under section 96 and an administrator. It will also extend the secrecy provisions to the Torres Strait Regional Authority when it commences on 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Regional Council Estimates Processes and Reporting Requirements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill includes provisions to strengthen the annual reporting requirements of regional councils. As a result of the proposed amendments, regional councils will be obliged to provide to the commission an annual report dealing with the operations of the regional council during the year, the implementation during that year of the regional plan, details of grants made from regional council budgets during the year and any other matters relating to that year as the commission determines in writing. The annual report and regional plan are required to be made available for inspection and purchase by residents of the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, provision is made in the bill to require regional councils to have regard to their regional plans when preparing their draft budgets. This linkage is considered necessary because of the increased powers which regional councils will have over the disbursement of commission funds. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Delegations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes provision for a number of changes to the power of delegation under the principal act. Some of the changes relate to administrative matters. I refer in particular to the proposal to enable the commission to delegate to the Director of Evaluation and Audit its powers for the appointment of consultants under section 56 and also to enable the chief executive officer power to sub-delegate functions or powers to a member of the staff of the commission. However, the more important aspect of the amendments relates to the enhanced responsibilities given to regional councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key recommendations of the commission in its report to me was the need for greater empowerment of regional councils. The bill provides for the commission to delegate to a regional council its powers to approve funds and issue guarantees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These powers are not unfettered. It is important that honourable members note that these delegated powers will be subject to any written directions by the commission and are accompanied by sanctions to protect the interests of the government, ATSIC and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Provision is also made to empower the commission chairperson to suspend delegations to regional councils in certain cases. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">General Funding Powers</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of the key recommendations of the commission was the need to simplify funding powers of the commission. This bill spells out the new and simplified arrangements. I must reiterate to honourable members that it is neither the commission's nor the government's intention to in any way water down accountability requirements either to the parliament or to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people whom the commission represents. Indeed, the effect of the amendments is to enhance that accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned, however, over the current complex and inflexible provisions and propose that they be amended to enable the commission to more successfully fulfil the functions imposed upon it by the principal act. As the government has stated on a number of occasions, true self-determination is fundamental to the success of the commission and it is in pursuit of this that these amendments are put before the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, the changes enable the commission to make a grant of money or grant an interest in land or grant an interest in personal property or make a loan of money to any body corporate or unincorporated organisation. In certain cases this power extends to individuals. Regional councils and the Torres Strait Regional Authority cannot be recipients. This provision is accompanied by a requirement that such grants, loans and guarantees may only be made for the purpose of furthering the social, economic or cultural development of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For purposes of enhanced scrutiny the bill also requires the commission to formulate decision making principles about the giving of grants, loans and guarantees. Funding must only be made in accordance with these decision making principles. The chief executive officer must cause a notice of the making of decision making principles to be published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. He must also ensure that copies of the decision making principles which are in force are given to each regional council and are available for inspection and purchase at each of the commission's offices. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Corporate Plan</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important technical amendments which the commission has suggested is the need to remove the direct link between the commission's corporate plan and the procedures for the engagement of consultants. The bill proposes that this link be severed. Instead, the commission will be required to set out the criteria and standard terms and conditions for the engagement of consultants by way of written instrument and to notify the making of the instrument in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Staff and Consultants</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second amending bill passed earlier in these sittings, wards were created for the purposes of electing regional councillors. This present bill includes consequent provisions which prohibit a member of the staff of the commission or a consultant to the commission standing for election, or being elected, as a member for a regional council ward. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Draft Budgets</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for simplification of the draft budget, and the estimates processes involved, for both the commission and regional councils. Consistent with the proposed streamlining of funding provisions, the bill reduces the number of elements required in the commission's estimates of expenditure. Equally important, the bill facilitates a greater devolution of funding to regional council budgets by enabling the commission to earmark elements of regional council allocations for particular purposes. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Removal of Regional Councils</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned earlier, both the commission and the government wish to maintain and enhance the accountability requirements. Included in this bill are amendments which strengthen the responsibility of the commission and regional councils. The bill provides for the commission to remove regional councils from office in certain situations.

<PARA>The charter of the Department of Social Security is to deliver social security entitlements with fairness, courtesy and efficiency. With this in mind, this bill contains a range of omnibus amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 to further refine the government's carefully balanced income support programs administered under that act. The bill also provides for the implementation of a 1993 budget initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Act currently provides for the payment of mobility allowance to disabled persons who have jobsearch as part of their agreed activity plan but who cannot use public transport without substantial assistance because of their disability.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Social Security Act, a person does not have to make a proper claim for sole parent pension if the person is receiving a wife pension or a carer pension, the person's partner dies, immediately before the end of the bereavement period the person is qualified for wife or carer pension respectively and immediately after the end of that period the person is qualified for sole parent pension. However, this is not the case for a person in similar circumstances who qualifies for widow B pension. The bill corrects this difference by amending the act to allow a person to be granted a widow B pension without the need to make a proper claim in similar circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with much pleasure that I inform the House that this bill gives effect to a new international social security agreement between Australia and the Republic of Italy. The new agreement follows a review instigated by Australia and encouraged by Australian-Italian community groups and representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Act provides that, if there is a charge or encumbrance over a particular assessable asset of a person that is not used for primary production, the value of the asset is reduced by the value of that charge or encumbrance. This reduction is not allowed to the extent that the charge or encumbrance is a collateral security or was given for the benefit of a person other than the person or the person's partner. If the charge or encumbrance is over a mix of assessable and exempt assets, it is apportioned between those assets. Assets cannot be reduced by the value of unsecured liabilities and, if a secured liability exceeds the value of the unencumbered asset, the excess is not an allowable deduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments were made to the Social Security Act in 1991 to allow more generous rules to apply to primary producers by providing that the aggregate value of primary production assets could be reduced by the aggregate value of their liabilities that are related to the carrying on of primary production. This means that the value of their primary production assets can be reduced by the value of their unsecured liabilities, as well as by the amount that a secured liability exceeds the value of the asset that provides the primary security. However, it was always intended that where a liability exists in relation to an asset that is an any part exempt for the purposes of the assets test, then the apportionment rule should apply. This bill gives effect to that intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Act provides for certain assets to be disregarded in calculating a person's assets for the purposes of the pensions and benefits assets tests. One type of asset that is disregarded is a life interest unless it is a life interest in the principal home of the person or the person's partner or it has been created by the person or the person's partner. The intention in not allowing these latter types of life interests to be disregarded was to prevent people from gaining an unfair advantage under the assets test by converting absolute interests in property into a life interest.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal&mdash;SSAT&mdash;highlighted a deficiency in the legislation in situations where a life interest is created under the will of a deceased person who, immediately before their death, was the partner of the life tenant.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Act currently allows the assessable period of a client to be taken into account when the client realises a `saved' non-superannuation investment. Amendments contained in this bill ensure that the assessable period of a non-client partner will also be taken into account. The Social Security Act will also be amended to clarify the existing definition of `retirement village'. This amendment aims at preserving the original intention underlying this definition. It ensures that accommodation primarily intended for persons who are at an age that is more than 55 years is treated in the same way as accommodation primarily intended for persons who are at least 55 years of age; that is, as accommodation in a retirement village. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes further amendments to the confidentiality provisions of the Social Security Act as part of an ongoing vigilance by the Department of Social Security to safeguard a person's privacy. One of the key amendments relating to confidentiality that is contained in the bill provides for the extension of the definition of `protected information' to protect the information that the department has no information about a person; for example, that the person is not a client of the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further amendment tackles a loophole in the provisions. At the moment, it is not an offence under the Social Security Act for a person to disclose protected information if that information has been obtained by the person through innocent means; for example, if a person finds departmental papers about a client in the street and then tells another person about the details contained in those papers. This bill provides that, should a person obtaining the information know that it is protected information and intentionally record, disclose or otherwise use it, that person will be committing an offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A decision by the SSAT must usually be implemented by the Department of Social Security regardless of whether a further appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is lodged by either the department or the client. If the SSAT decision is to be delayed in its implementation, one of the parties must successfully seek a stay order from the AAT. The department seeks a stay order when it is unsuccessful at the SSAT and appeals to the AAT in situations where implementation of the decision would be detrimental to the longer term interests of the Commonwealth. A client seeks a stay order where he or she is unsuccessful at the SSAT, intends to appeal to the AAT, and wishes to continue to receive advantages that would cease if the SSAT decision were implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Problems arise where the SSAT has affirmed an original departmental decision. The decision on appeal to the AAT is then not the SSAT decision. Rather it is the departmental decision as affirmed by the SSAT. In several cases, the AAT has commented on this as a curious situation, because it means that there is no decision of the SSAT's own that it can stay. It is anomalous that departmental clients in a similar situation could be treated differently by the law depending on whether the SSAT and the department happened to be in agreement. This bill overcomes this anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Act lists all situations where an overpayment can be described as a `debt due to the Commonwealth' and so be recoverable. At present that list does not include a debt that has arisen because of social security payments made pursuant to an AAT stay order granted at the client's request where the client ultimately loses at the AAT and, with hindsight, it is clear that the money was not payable. As a result, these stay order debts cannot be recovered. This bill amends the act to add these debts to the categories of recoverable overpayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government decided in the 1993 budget context to abolish, from 1 July 1994, the administrative charge currently applicable under the Social Security Act in relation to certain debts. The administrative charge will be replaced with a penalty interest charge that can be applied to any debt owed under the act if, and only if, the person who owes the debt is not a current client of the department and refuses to enter into an agreement to repay the debt or if, having entered into such an agreement, the person defaults on the agreement. The bill also makes a number of minor and technical amendments as part of the ongoing exercise to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the Social Security Act. </PARA>

The amendments will facilitate the oversight of leased, chartered or interchanged aircraft by enabling a contracting state to enter into bilateral arrangements transferring some or all of its obligations relating to the airworthiness and safe operation of aircraft registered with it to the state in which those aircraft are based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These arrangements will permit closer and more effective oversight of the safety of such aircraft.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991 deal with two matters&mdash;numbering and protection of the content of communications. The ability to access and use numbers for telecommunications services is an important aspect of the government's reforms in telecommunications. To this end, the government transferred the responsibility for managing numbering from Telecom to Austel in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the Telecommunications Act, Austel has produced a numbering plan which provides a framework for the allocation and administration of numbers. Within this framework, it is important that the providers of telecommunications services have the flexibility to supply innovative services and packages to meet the needs of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are to remove some unintended consequences of the current act that reduce this flexibility. For instance, the amendments remove any restrictions on the further allocation of numbers by persons to whom they have been allocated and remove any doubt that carriers and other persons can charge for numbers they allocate. Accordingly, the amendments ensure that a service provider who has been allocated a number by a carrier can further allocate that number to its customer. If that customer wants a particular number which the carrier or service provider has been allocated because, for example, it has a memorable sequence, the carrier or service provider can charge a fee. It was always intended that the legislative reforms to telecommunications in 1991 would not prevent such charging of fees for special numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide consumer and competitive safeguards through enabling Austel to impose conditions on the use and allocation of such numbers. For example, Austel proposes to prevent fees being charged for the standard numbers allocated for the standard telephone service. It could also be used to enable customers to retain their existing telephone number, where feasible, when they elect to have another carrier provide that service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such conditions will be in the form of a disallowable instrument. These amendments have been prepared in consultation with Austel's Numbering Advisory Committee which includes the representatives of carriers, users and consumers.

I seek tonight to put the facts before the House about this proposal and to reject absolutely any allegations of wrongdoing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, Mr Speaker, the question raised sought to imply that there was something wrong about my involvement in the project. The fact is that I take my responsibilities very seriously as a local federal member representing the fine citizens of Moreton who have elected me twice to represent them in this place. I am actively involved in a wide range of committees, groups and associations working to provide facilities, services and programs to the people in the southern suburbs of Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am the chairperson of the establishment committee for the Mount Gravatt Workers Club. I am proud to be part of this exciting new development which will greatly enhance the facilities available to the whole community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mount Gravatt Workers Club has been working with the management committees of the Mount Gravatt Australian Football Club and the Mount Gravatt Soccer Club to create a single new club on the site of Dittmer Park and build excellent club, sporting and recreational facilities at this site. The application for a grant was made on the basis of demonstrated need in this inner urban area for facilities for youth and women, and to cater for the child-care needs of sports men and women utilising these facilities. The aim of the project is to broaden the facilities available at Dittmer Park so there is much greater utilisation by the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grant application was made at the same time as an application was made to the Brisbane City Council for an approval in principle for the redevelopment of the project, approval which has subsequently been granted. The total cost of the project is over $5 million. The Commonwealth grant was for $200,000. The terms and conditions of this grant are that the department reimburse the club for expenditure already made on the specific proposals contained in the grant application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up to this time, $18,000 has been reimbursed to the club from the department for design costs associated with the proposal. The club has expended almost $40,000 in design and associated activities in preparation for the redevelopment. The awarding of the Commonwealth grant has also been a major catalyst for substantial support for the project from a number of quarters in the community. The discussions and planning for this new project have involved a very public, fully transparent process, including four public meetings held over the past 18 months at the site of the Mount Gravatt Australian Football Club. Further, the proposed redevelopment was on show for three days at the Mount Gravatt show held in late July which stimulated a great deal of public discussion and approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the local member of parliament, I am very much in touch with the needs and aspirations of my local community, and am active in working with local organisations. I also convene the establishment committee for the southern suburbs employment network, a group of local business people, training providers, government departments and agencies in the southern suburbs of Brisbane working on strategies to stimulate employment in our area. Is there anything wrong with being involved in that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also convenor of the southern suburbs senior citizens picnic and concert committee which plans and conducts a major public function for over 2,000 senior citizens in Mott Park each July in Senior Citizens Week in Queensland. Is there something wrong with being involved in that committee? I have also convened for the past 18 months an informal group of church and community youth workers investigating the need for youth counselling services in our area. As you can see, Mr Speaker, I am an active participant in a range of committees and organisations trying to identify the needs of our local community and serving the needs of Moreton. I am proud to be involved in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The redevelopment project at Dittmer Park reflects a considerable need for facilities serving youth and the needs of families for a broader range of appropriate services in our area.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March of this year I was diagnosed as having Ovarian Sarcoma Stage 3 bordering on Stage 4 with pelvic seeding. I had radical surgery followed by chemotherapy. From this point on until August I subjected myself on a monthly basis to the hell that is chemotherapy.</PARA>

This hospital was, until last month, unique in the state inasmuch as it offered care from diagnosis to death. Put more bluntly it offered a hospice service. The cost containment forced on the Queen Elizabeth Hospital by an ill-informed minister dictated that this ward be closed each week from Friday until Monday morning. The problems of nursing patients with gynaecological cancer can be profoundly disturbing to both the patient and the nurse. Indeed it requires special skills to undertake this type of care. By reducing the ward of 7 shifts involves a loss of skills hard won.</PARA>

The closure of the railway operations in the area probably cost it another 50 or 100 jobs. Whilst that is not the fault of the federal government, it is most certainly the fault of the ALP government in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deeply regret the attitude of the government, as well as the leadership on this side of the House on free trade in the sugar and the banana industries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deregulation of the industry will leave the farmers in a situation where they have only one mill to sell to, which means that the mill enjoys a monopoly and can pay to the farmers whatever price it wishes to pay because the farmers have no other person they can sell the cane to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Switching subjects completely before I sit down, the recent Industry Commission report on the taxi industry was almost an entirely unbelievable document. It has suggested that the industry should be totally deregulated.

All the taxidrivers in the Kennedy electorate have invested almost every cent they have in the entire world&mdash;and a lot they do not have&mdash;in their taxi licences. Those licenses were purchased in good faith. This extraordinary document has come from a very important government body, a highly respected&mdash;I deeply regret to say&mdash;government body.

The manager of that mine said that `the mine would stay open if copper prices stayed above US$0.70 a pound'. That mine, which has operated for a hundred years&mdash;and had three or four generations of Tasmanians working in it&mdash;is going to close.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The activity conducted within the NAS Nowra workshops (aircraft component maintenance) was given a non-core classification by Navy and this was agreed by the Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Development) (ACDEV) and the First Assistant Secretary of the Force Development and Analysis Division (FASFDA) on 1 May 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. On 1 May 1992, ACDEV and FASFDA agreed a Deputy Chief of Naval Staff proposed classification of core/non-core activities in Navy, which included a determination that the activities conducted in the NAS Nowra workshops are non-core.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. Activities designated `core' are not considered for commercialisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. Navy does not issue classifications regarding the level of maintenance performed in workshops in the context of the Commercial Support Program. The activity performed within the NAS Nowra workshops is however designated non-core.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Some maintenance elements for RAN aviation are designated as core. For example, the activities performed by maintenance personnel on RAN aircraft squadrons are core because these maintenance personnel might be deployed to an area of operations. Similarly, some Service personnel in the NAS Nowra workshops form a Mobile Aircraft Support Team which is deployable to areas of operations. The activities performed by the Mobile Aircraft Support Team are also designated core, which meant that this part of the workshop activity was exempt from CSP review. For virtually all of the NAS Nowra workshops, however, the activities performed are not deployable, hence the classification as a non-core activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) No. Two former RAN commissioned officers are now employed by British Aerospace (Australia) Ltd at NAS Nowra. Neither had access to commercial-in-confidence material relating to the In-House-Bid which was lodged by NAS Nowra. The normal Departmental rules on post separation employment were followed when the officers left the Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) No. The workload is adequately defined and was properly specified in the Statement of Requirement released with the Aircraft Component Maintenance Request for Quotation (RFQ) to industry. In any event a significant proportion of the S-70B-2 maintenance activity does not form part of the scope of work contained in the contract between British Aerospace (Australia) Ltd and the Commonwealth. Parts were excluded from CSP review pending finalisation of Test Program Sets to be used to diagnose some S-70B-2 equipment and the acceptance into Naval service of facilities to test S-70B-2 T700 engines and Main Rotor Blade Dampers. On finalisation of the Test Program Sets and facilities for equipment testing, the remaining S-70B-2 maintenance activities will be tested for commercialisation, if designated as non-core.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) During the source selection phase of the review of aircraft component maintenance a very detailed analysis of technical and financial risks was conducted by the Source Selection Team. The Source Selection report was later reviewed by a Senior Navy Committee with One Star and Captain level representation. The Committee noted the exceptional quality of the Source Selection report, and agreed that the requirements of probity, propriety and thoroughness in the Source Selection recommendation had been met. Following review by the Senior Navy Committee, the Flag Officer Naval Support Command agreed the recommendation that British Aerospace (Australia) Ltd be selected as the preferred source.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) No. The NAS Nowra In-House Option was treated exactly the same as any other commercial-in-confidence tender bid with the normal safeguards against disclosure applied. Moreover all parties who had access to the In-House-Option bid during the evaluation process were given a directive which required the strict confidentiality and safe-keeping of the document. The bidding process was at all times fair and above board. Selection of British Aerospace (Australia) Pty Ltd as the preferred source will result in annual recurring savings of approximately $5 million to the Commonwealth. Moreover, the cost of the preferred source is 70 percent less than the previous means of conducting the activity (the status quo).</PARA>
