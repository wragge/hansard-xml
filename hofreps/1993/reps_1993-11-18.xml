<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T4">Mr FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report I have just tabled completes the committee's survey of the countries in Australia's immediate region. This survey entailed the 1989 South Pacific countries report and the 1991 report on Papua New Guinea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report into relations with Indonesia results from a reference to the committee on 20 June 1991. In its activity, the committee received over 200 submissions and held 18 public hearings in various capital cities and one in Broome. The report makes 36 recommendations about the relationship with Indonesia. The committee also received a reference to examine the 1990-91 and 1991-92 annual reports of the Australia-Indonesia Institute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before outlining some of the more significant recommendations in our report, I would like to make some more general comments on the relationship this country has with Indonesia. While the current relationship is open and positive, it has not always been this way. There are still issues of the greatest sensitivity which must be dealt with on a regular basis. Rather than concentrating on the difficulties of the past, the committee has sought to emphasise ways to broaden and deepen what currently exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While our two nations do have contrasts, these differences should not be overemphasised. One of the differences which are significant is the major role played by the armed forces in Indonesia compared with the role of the Defence Force in Australia. Because of the role the Indonesian armed forces played in the struggle against the Dutch after 1945, they have a special place in Indonesian society. A significant number of positions are reserved for military representatives in the parliament. Many officers work outside what we might consider formal military structures. The military has an important nation building role in addition to the one we would recognise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that at times it was easier to concentrate on the differences rather than the similarities. Reactions on both sides to the actions of the other have sometimes smacked of xenophobia. It has also been easy to ignore or play down the similarities and the things which bring Indonesia and Australia together. In a regional context the two nations have outlooks which are surprisingly similar. For example, we both value the concepts of self-reliance and national resilience. Moreover, Australia and Indonesia share fundamental security interests in a strong, politically stable and economically dynamic region, free from the involvement of external powers with interests inimical to our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia is a central player in ASEAN, consistent with having the largest population and GDP. The ASEAN secretariat is located in Jakarta. Australia is one of ASEAN's seven dialogue partners and meets annually at ministerial and official level to discuss economic and a range of other issues. In recent years, Australia has aspired to an acceptance of a closer relationship on these fronts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although still cautious about the way APEC might develop, Indonesia has shown a lively interest in a range of matters involving that body. It is an active contributor to several of the APEC work projects and has provided valuable support to Australian initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia and Australia have cooperated in other international matters such as initiatives for the settlement to the Cambodia tragedy, and on the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations. Indonesia's international role has been augmented by its leadership of the non-aligned movement and its election to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, it is now not difficult to provide a range of examples of cooperation and ties between Indonesia and Australia in both regional and multilateral matters. One of the more surprising features of this inquiry was discovering just how many ties exist and how deep they are. The relationship has grown and developed substantially over the past five years or so. The intensity and diversity of state-provincial connections also impressed the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The welcome received throughout Indonesia on the study tour by 10 members of the committee in October 1992 was clear evidence of Indonesia's interest in Australia. Members were generally impressed by the willingness of Indonesian authorities to enter into dialogue on matters of committee interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this report makes clear, there are many opportunities for Australia in a relationship with Indonesia: in trade, education and technology, particularly. The defence links are very concrete, and significant personal relationships have arisen through exchanges and visits of the service personnel of each country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flow of tourists between the two countries is, perhaps fortunately, now more two-way than it used to be and not simply to and from Bali. Thanks in part to the work of the Australia-Indonesia Institute, people to people contact has increased. Some high level cultural programs and exchanges are also taking place. All of these positive developments bode well for the relationship, and it is pleasing to document them briefly in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inevitably, during any discussion of relations with Indonesia, the issue of human rights is raised. The subject engendered the greatest amount of interest in the inquiry. Many witnesses with deep interests in these matters made valuable contributions. The committee has made a number of recommendations on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two major concerns guided our considerations. The first was the recognition of the limits of national sovereignty, together with the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other nations. The second was an earnest desire not to sermonise or be offensive while, at the same time, being fully aware that many Australians are deeply and justifiably distressed about general and specific abuses of human rights in Indonesia. To ignore the strong input of the evidence on human rights in Indonesia would also deny a significant strand in Australian foreign policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report there are a number of references to an earlier report by this committee: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A review of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights</EMPHASIS>. It provided a useful reference point on these issues and a valid framework for our ideas on human rights in Indonesia. That also was a unanimous report. It is reasonable to point out that, in that report, the committee was critical of some aspects of human rights in Australia. It was tabled in December 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our major recommendation in the matter is that the Australian government should continue to make representations about the principles and practice of human rights in Indonesia. East Timor, Irian Jaya and Aceh are areas of special concern. We have also recommended the reopening of the Australian consulate in Dili. The committee believes this would be a recognisable and diplomatic statement of Australia's concerns about East Timor and provide the Australian people with worthwhile information of any advances in this matter. It was unfortunate that the study tour could not enter East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other subject which generated a great amount of evidence was fishing by Indonesian nationals off the north and north-west coasts of Australia. Many of those who fish illegally have been forced to do so because of economic necessity. Some species have been so overfished in Indonesian waters that it is understandable that attempts are made to seek stock in southern waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1974 memorandum of understanding with Indonesia was negotiated to solve a number of problems. Among other things it governs the right of traditional Indonesian fishermen to visit and fish in waters on the outer edge of the continental shelf. Since then other situations have arisen and the MOU does not deal with all categories of fishermen who should be considered as traditional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, arrangements for fishermen of both nations in the Arafura Sea are not satisfactory. We have recommended a thorough examination of all aspects of Indonesian fishing in Australian waters, with a view to renegotiating the MOU with Indonesia, defining `traditional' fishermen more appropriately and arriving at a more satisfactory arrangement for fishermen in the Arafura Sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we made a number of suggestions about human rights and fishery matters, we also made recommendations to encourage Australian business in Indonesia. In this area, we recommended that the Australia-Indonesia Business Council and the chambers of commerce and industry be involved in the distribution of a publication titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Austrade's Business Guide to Indonesia</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also recommended that an Australian consulate be opened in Surabaya in East Java, which is an area of growing importance to Australian business in Indonesia. However, it was in the scientific and educational fields that the committee made the greatest number of recommendations. The principal recommendation was a proposal for consultation with Indonesian authorities about providing additional resources to schools in the eastern provinces of Indonesia. During the inquiry, we heard evidence about the importance of the existence of the Australian Studies Centre at the University of Indonesia in providing Indonesians with the knowledge to explain Australia and its ways to other Indonesians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eastern provinces are significant recipients of Australian development assistance. In addition, because of the proximity of Darwin to such places as Ambon, there are already other connections between these provinces and Australia. We have therefore recommended that there be a study of the costs and feasibility of establishing an Australian studies centre in the eastern provinces. If the outcome of this study is favourable, we believe that an approach should be made to an appropriate university in these provinces to assist in the establishment of such a centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia-Indonesia Institute was set up in 1989, amongst other things, to increase people to people contact. Members of the committee were concerned to discover that not only has it had to cope with the same allocation of funds, but it now also has to pay for the printing of its annual report and for administrative expenses incurred in supporting its board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of greater concern is a proposal to reduce the institute's dedicated staff from four to two. The director's position, which would be downgraded as part of this proposal, has been vacant since February 1993. The committee does not regard this as a satisfactory state of affairs for an institute central to our continuing relationship with a neighbour which the government itself acknowledges to be of crucial importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I thank the committee staff for the contribution they have made throughout the inquiry. A number of situations, including the election and the early advertising of the inquiry, have meant that it has perhaps gone on for longer than expected. Particularly in the last few months, there has been a great call on the staff's resources, and I thank them and the members of the committee for their efforts. </PARA>

I am glad that the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) is in the House because he was a member of the committee when the decision was made to take on this particular inquiry. In fact, his concern about aspects of the relationship, particularly those relating to the fisheries situation, was one of the determining factors in having the inquiry established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a very important inquiry and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's relations with Indonesia</EMPHASIS> is a very important report. One of the things that we discovered during the inquiry was the great degree of ignorance in Australia about the total situation in relation to Australia's connections with Indonesia. As honourable members will be aware, within the Australian community&mdash;and this is even mentioned in the report&mdash;a significant number of people view the development of Indonesia with some concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report adds greatly to the store of knowledge on Indonesia which is available to the community. I hope that it will be widely read and made available throughout Australia because it sets out the background to the situation quite well, and it addresses many of the concerns that people have in relation to Australia's contacts with Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's contacts and relationships with Indonesia are extraordinarily important. It is a nation of 180 million-plus people, and that number is growing&mdash;it will be well over 200 million early next century. It is a nation of incredible natural wealth and incredible energy. The growth rates, as recorded in this report, are impressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally enough, as the chairman of the committee has said, this leads to some concerns amongst Australians when we see ourselves with a vast landmass with a very small population faced by a rapidly growing population to our north with increasing resources available to it. Obviously this is something which needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report, apart from the matters that have already been referred to, I would like to stress that, whilst a great number of the submissions to the inquiry concerned human rights abuses in Indonesia, particularly in relation to East Timor, we were at great pains not to allow that issue to dominate the inquiry that we undertook. I think it is most important that that be stressed. Whilst it is, of course, extremely important and we do not hesitate to make recommendations in relation to that most significant and serious matter of human rights abuse, there are very positive aspects of the relationship which need to be understood and need to be stressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ones I want to draw some attention to in the brief time available to me this morning relate particularly to education within Australia about Indonesia and education within Indonesia about Australia. I was most impressed, as were other members of the committee, by the very real appreciation of the opportunities for close cooperation between Australia and Indonesia which were exhibited particularly in the Northern Territory. There is a very great significance being placed on the study of the Indonesian language; there are relationships between provinces and between schools in the Northern Territory and in Indonesia; and, of course, there is a growing trade relationship based around Darwin and in eastern Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is terribly important, but it is only one part of the potential which is offered by a greater understanding of the opportunities for Australia by increasing the significance of its relations, particularly its business relations, with Indonesia. That will come about when more and more people understand more about our close neighbour, and that again will come about when we have a greater emphasis on study, for instance, of the Indonesian language within Australian schools. I was very disappointed at the low level of the study of the Indonesian language within Australian educational institutions, and I would like to see a very much greater emphasis put on Australian studies at the University of Indonesia, and put on Indonesian studies at various educational institutions within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is tremendously important that our young people not only  learn to speak the language but also have a greater appreciation of the culture, background and actuality of life in Indonesia itself. I would commend particularly the Northern Territory and Western Australia for their continuing efforts to improve this understanding through the educational medium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that disappointed me was the lack of Australian business interest in and understanding of the opportunities presented by the burgeoning economy of Indonesia as an export market. Obviously there are some who do understand and who are working hard in this area, but I do not believe there is a sufficient across-the-board appreciation of the opportunities that are there within the Indonesian market. It does require, of course, close cooperation with institutions, businesses and professions within Indonesia itself. Joint ventures seem to be the way to go, and the picking of local Indonesian partners for these joint ventures is of critical importance. Nevertheless, the growth of the economy in Indonesia in recent times and the purchasing power which is available to a greater and greater proportion of the Indonesian population really offer Australian exporters an enormous opportunity, and there should be much greater incentive given within the business community to accepting and exploiting those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area which is of great significance to us relates to the defence relationships. There is, within the Australian community, quite a degree of concern about the size of the Indonesian military forces, but that concern is, I believe, misplaced. There is a general misunderstanding about the structure of the Indonesian forces and their capacity to operate in defence situations as we would understand them. The defence forces of Indonesia have a much greater role within that country than Australian defence forces have in Australia and that needs to be appreciated by a far greater percentage of the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, I think, encouraging signs that defence cooperation between the two countries is becoming more successful. During the inquiry, we had some joint training exercises between the Australian navy and the Indonesian navy and I believe at the moment there are some joint exercises involving the air forces of the two countries. In my view, it is essential that that defence relationship be expanded so that there is again a greater understanding between defence personnel and senior defence personnel in Indonesia and their counterparts in Australia and this development of understanding and appreciation of each other's point of view can only lead to a more successful and more soundly based relationship in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was encouraging to meet a number of Indonesians within Indonesia who have been educated in Australia or partly trained in Australia and I believe that more emphasis should be given to that area of the relationship as well. There are continuing areas of difficulty and the report makes a number of recommendations in relation to them. For instance, as the chairman has already reported, the problem of Indonesian fishermen in Australian territorial waters is still a factor which needs to be worked on and I believe there are some positive recommendations in that area which could, if implemented, not only develop the resources within the Indonesian territorial waters themselves but also lead to a greater understanding of Australia's position amongst Indonesian fishermen and authorities, in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the third of the trilogy, as the chairman has already mentioned, and, taken together, I believe these reports do a great deal to develop an understanding of our relationships with countries immediately surrounding us and to provide a very useful historical and academic background to those relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to thank very much indeed all those members of staff who have worked so long and hard over many months now, burning the midnight oil. They have been absolutely outstanding and we value very much their contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to join my colleagues the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) in responding to the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's relations with Indonesia</EMPHASIS>. Apart from being a report about Papua New Guinea, our nearest neighbour, it is also a report about our most important neighbour. Countries cannot escape the constraints of their geography. We and Indonesia are locked by geography in perpetuity together. No other relationship will be more significant for the fate of future generations of Australians than that with Indonesia. No other relationship demands so much attention, requires so much effort and justifies so much hard work. It is certainly not an easy task nor an easy relationship because rarely in the world do we find neighbouring countries so different in culture, religion and historical experience as are Indonesia and Australia, and our very proximity throws up complex bilateral issues. But, if that makes the challenge tougher, it makes even more imperative the need for each country to understand each other and to work together to resolve the inevitable tensions that derive from proximity combined with very different cultural perspectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As other colleagues have observed, central to the tensions that have existed between Indonesia and Australia are fundamental differences in national approaches to human rights, exemplified for many Australians by the contemporary tragedy in East Timor and by abuses of human rights in Aceh. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report does not shy from that tension. Indeed, it devotes its longest chapter, chapter 7, to human rights in Indonesia and the issue, of course, is touched upon throughout the report. Yet the report does caution against allowing that issue, important as it is, to completely overshadow the relationship between the two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept the view promulgated by some that concern for human rights is somehow simply a Western concern, a neo-colonialist notion. Respect for the sanctity of human life and respect for human liberty and the rights of the human conscience are embodied at the core of nearly every religion and system of ethics known to man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And even if at times, men&mdash;Christians, I am afraid, not least amongst them&mdash;have failed to respect those fundamental rights, we do have a duty, not as Westerners but as human beings, to protect such basic rights and protest their violation. As an earlier report from this committee pointed out, `the diminution of the rights of any group detracts from the whole'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But while not yielding on this fundamental point, we have to recognise the very different historical and cultural experiences of Indonesia and seek to understand its cultural attitudes and perspectives. Unless we do this we will simply talk at Indonesians, not with them. And only by a dialogue with them can we ultimately hope to change attitudes and policies. Neighbours do not have the luxury of striking moral postures. They can either talk and work together to resolve their differences or drift into isolation and perhaps hostility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have suggested a series of practical steps whereby we can contribute in practical ways to increase sensitivity to human rights within the Indonesian elites. But perhaps even more important to achieving this understanding is increasing the people to people contact between our two countries. Despite significant advances in recent years, for neighbours we still have a disappointing level of person to person contacts except perhaps for Bali. Thus there is a strong emphasis in the report on furthering the cultural contacts between the two nations, particularly the enhancement of the role of the Australia-Indonesia Institute, giving substance to our scientific agreements, improving our education exchanges, increasing the language skills between the two countries and providing greater support for Australian studies in Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trade too breaches the barriers of misunderstanding. Total trade has quadrupled in the past 10 years and Indonesia is now our 10th largest export market. Yet our trade lags behind its potential, given the pace of growth in Indonesia. Therefore the committee welcomes the recently established Australian-Indonesian Ministerial Forum and its working group structure to develop bilateral trade. We also welcome the initiatives that state governments have taken in trade with Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report looks at practical ways in which trade and investment can be furthered and it tackles sensitive trade related issues such as Indonesian fishing in Australian waters&mdash;which my colleagues have referred to&mdash;and the role Australia might play in assisting Indonesia with its energy needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would therefore recommend the report to all interested Australians not as a definitive survey of our most important neighbour but as a snapshot of a point in time of the Australia-Indonesia relationship, the challenges it faces today and the ways we may go about resolving those challenges. I thank the chairman and all members of the committee and the staff for their excellent supportive work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes available to me I do not intend to canvass the ground covered by my colleagues. I share their concerns and identify the points that they have raised as matters of common concern. I also would like to express my thanks not just to the staff, whose work has been exemplary, and particularly to Patrick Regan, but also to His Excellency Mr Sabam Siagian, the Indonesian Ambassador to Australia. Through him and in conjunction with President Suharto and his government, significant cooperation was given to the presentation and production of the report, when at times they may perhaps have been sceptical about what emphasis we might put on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to spend a great deal of time covering general matters. There are three matters, however, that I want to briefly advert to. The first is that most Australians know Indonesia largely through visits to Bali. Bali is not Indonesia. Indeed, while there is a broadening of our relationship&mdash;and we were delighted to see the benefit of associations made by Western Australia and the Northern Territory&mdash;there is far more to our relationship than just that visit to the exotica of Bali, delightful resort though it might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, what I found delightful was the extent to which relations with the eastern provinces of Indonesia have flourished. Within our recommendations, there are a number that really give new emphasis to this. I trust that the government will pick those out and proceed with them because, if we are able to proceed with improving our contacts and our relationships with those eastern provinces, I see an opportunity to overcome some of the prejudices and the concerns that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) just remarked, chapter 7 within the report spends a great deal of time on the human rights issues which concerned every member of the committee. An aspect of that, of course, is the degree to which there is free and open contact with those eastern provinces, particularly with East Timor and Irian Jaya. I commend those recommendations within the report that suggest an opening and extension of our relationship with those provinces, for it is one way for Indonesia to see Australia as not intruding in its affairs and, by opening up those provinces, to allow them to grow at a perhaps greater rate than is presently possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of my concern, in looking at the genesis of the report, was the degree to which transmigration within Indonesia and the extent of Javanisation were going to intrude on the preservation of what is really a remarkably diverse archipelagic country. It is incredible to think of the extent of the islands that represent Indonesia. There is much in this report that identifies them, and I do not intend to comment further on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having looked at the extent to which transmigration is now being processed, I believe there has been a recognition by the Indonesian administration of some of the problems. I was pleased to see that, particularly in the eastern provinces again, it has withdrawn from some of the arbitrary character of those movements. I think it is necessary for Indonesia to do that, if it wishes to preserve the harmony that Pancasila essentially represents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area, and the one that I really wanted to spend a little more time on, was the relations between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Whilst the committee's last report was on Papua New Guinea, it remains my major concern that there is a difficulty in trying to ensure Papua New Guinea's understanding that Australia today sees Papua New Guinea as an entirely independent country and Australia as being a friendly neighbour. I am delighted that that same approach appeared to us to develop between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. There is, of course, reference within the report to Indonesia's relations with Papua New Guinea. Without going into that in detail&mdash;it is in chapter 5&mdash;I think that any dispassionate reader will see that we found that defence, political and commercial relationships have matured significantly, and I commend the Indonesian administration in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do believe that, for the progress of Irian Jaya, a great deal more needs to be done. It is still, as is Papua New Guinea, a country which has been transformed from the Stone Age into the modern world in a remarkably short period of time&mdash;in only two generations, indeed. There are enormous challenges, but it would be a pity if the changes in character of Irian Jaya&mdash;any more than of PNG&mdash;were not to allow the development of the individual people there, for they do have unique characteristics, and I think it is important that they be preserved. I commend this report for reading and consideration. I think it will make a very valuable contribution to the improved understanding of our relations with this very important and close neighbour of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate, because I believe that the report that has been tabled today, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's relations with Indonesia</EMPHASIS>, is a very valuable contribution to the body of knowledge and information about the important relationship between Australia and Indonesia. I joined this committee only a few months ago, and therefore have been involved in the latter part only of the deliberations and development of this report. Looking at the detail that is contained in the report, I think that all honourable members of this House can be pleased that what is being tabled today provides a very rational and balanced assessment of the strength of the relationship between Australia and Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we debate issues of importance&mdash;and we have talked about the issue of human rights and the difficulties that that issue has placed on the relationship between Australia and Indonesia&mdash;too often there is a misconception that those people who wish to pursue human rights concerns are anti-Indonesian, or that they have a negative view about Indonesia generally, and that they are using the issue of human rights to generally attack Indonesia and to undermine its authority in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that what we have done with this report is lay a very solid foundation of understanding about where Australia comes from in its approach to human rights and its approach to Indonesia. I am on record in this place as having been critical of Indonesia about human rights and, in particular, about its treatment of East Timor. I stand by those criticisms but I also very solidly stand by the contents of this report because I am not anti-Indonesian. I think very few members in this House are anti-Indonesian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is very important that Australia continue to develop a very positive relationship with Indonesia because there are very important reasons and benefits for both our countries in that. What we have done in this report is clarify all of the arms of that relationship and give some very solid body to the detail about that relationship. We are making sure that it is a balanced assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are criticisms that we have of Indonesia, as Indonesians have criticisms of us. They have that right to criticise us. We have things that are wrong in our country that deserve to be criticised. I think if we are going to have a mature relationship with Indonesia, which I think we have now got, both countries have to accept that there are going to be differences of view on occasions and that there are going to be different perspectives on the way we handle issues. But what we need to do is have a much better understanding of where each country comes from, the historical context within which our criticisms might be placed and the structure within our societies. This report by the committee goes a long way towards achieving that. I think it is an excellent report and I am pleased to be associated with its production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two particular elements of the report I would like to briefly comment on which I am not sure have been mentioned yet. The first one is in regard to the nuclear industry in Indonesia. That is an issue of particular concern to me. In chapter 11 of the report there are a number of recommendations outlining the committee's views in regard to the development of the nuclear power industry in Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand and appreciate the incredible demand that is going to be placed on Indonesia's electricity supply industry over the next 20 years. We appreciate that Indonesia needs to be looking at the most efficient and effective ways of producing power. But I am very concerned that Indonesia needs to appreciate also the fact that Australia has some concerns about that because of possible safety implications in the future. I would urge the serious consideration of the recommendations contained in chapter 11 on that matter. It is an issue of concern to Australia that Indonesia look at other forms of technology as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also urge recommendation 28 to be adopted by the government. That says that the committee recommends the ministerial agreement on science and technology be debated in both houses of parliament after it is signed and that detailed information be given at that time about the scope of the subsidiary agreements. I think it is important that we all be aware of what is involved in that agreement and that Australia's concerns be clearly espoused in that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few brief references to this excellent report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's relations with Indonesia</EMPHASIS>, and commend my colleagues for its completion. I would like to make some initial remarks in relation to the establishment of the committee's inquiry. I thank the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) for his comments about my role in that. I think it is only fair that I should also compliment him on his role in expanding the terms of reference. It is very important to note that although Indonesia received its independence very soon after the Second World War there has been a marked reluctance within this parliament to grapple with the issue of Australia's overall relationship with Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we first discussed this matter in the committee there was some reluctance because there was a fear about what the implications may be, a fear about how Indonesia would see the Australian parliament conducting a thorough review of our relationship with that country. We started to talk about issues relating to fishing in the northern waters of Australia and the difficulties we had there with Indonesian fishermen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was clearly a need to expand the reference in accordance with a decision of the committee some years previously to conduct a major review of all Australia's international relationships with our neighbours. In that context, I was able to argue with success that we could hardly ignore the most important neighbour of all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I later visited Jakarta and, to my surprise, I found there was some concern. There was a perception in Jakarta that, if a parliament was conducting an `investigation', as they put it, the presumption was that there was something to criticise. I went to some lengths to emphasise that that was not the purpose of the inquiry; rather it was to see in a holistic sense the Australian relationship as it had developed with Indonesia and to see how in a productive sense we could expand that relationship while at the same time admitting areas of friction, or areas of concern, or areas of difference, which we believe should be highlighted, and on that basis be in a position to come up with a series of recommendations as to how those problems should be addressed. In that context, Indonesia has accepted, I think, the role of this parliament, and I hope the day will come when it will be possible to put together joint inquiries of members of this parliament working with members of the Indonesian parliament, not just to develop in a wider context our relationship, but specific areas: for example, the expansion of trade between Indonesia and Australia, the question of the educational relationship and the need to expand our knowledge of language across the spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormous demand in Indonesia for English language training. Equally, there should be a greater demand in Australia to learn Bahasa Indonesia. The House should be aware that we are not just talking about the lingua franca or the national language of Indonesia; we are also talking about the national language of Malaysia and about the majority language of the southern provinces of the Philippines. In other words, with the exception of Chinese, whether it be Mandarin or Cantonese, or any other dialect of the south, Bahasa Indonesia or the Malay group of languages is in fact the most spoken language in the entire region north of Australia. Therefore, we need to take more seriously how its study should be expanded in Australia. I would like to see the development of a relationship between the governments of the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia, working together to see how they can expand and support development in Australia of a greater appreciation of the need to study the Indo-Malay language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue also arose, within the context of this report, of the relationship between Australia and Indonesia and the political strength, or the Indonesian elites, which was referred to by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett). The role of the armed forces in Indonesian politics, especially through the Golkar party, is manifestly obvious and one which we certainly cannot ignore. Nevertheless, there are other elites growing up. There is the intellectual elite through the universities of Indonesia, there is a commercial elite growing up through the vast and burgeoning industrial strength of Indonesia, and so forth, all of which Australia must tap into, and our report went to some length to try to identify the need for this. One of my colleagues has already spoken about the fact that as yet we have not managed to infuse into the Australian commercial atmosphere the need to create a longstanding relationship with Indonesia and not just the fly-by-night approach&mdash;`There's a big market up there; let's make a one-week visit, shake a few hands, eat some Indonesian food and disappear back to Australia, and wonder a year later why very little has resulted from it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, we are now building links through our legal firms, through our accountancy firms and so forth; a growing number of business partnerships are being created. All of this is helping to diversify the relationship. The essential point is this: Indonesia's motto is `Unity in diversity'. It is an extraordinarily complex society and it is a society which Australia must do all it can to understand and to cooperate with in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with others in welcoming this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's relations with Indonesia</EMPHASIS>. Indonesia is one of our most important neighbours and the Australia-Indonesia relationship over many fields, but especially in the economic field, will grow and become even more important. I think all of us who were members of this inquiry, especially those of us who went to Indonesia, were amazed at the economic growth in that country and indeed the economic potential, and in a cooperative way we should be sharing in that and joining together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true, as I think the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) said, that Australia and Indonesia do not know enough about each other, and I join with him in commending the work that has been done in the Northern Territory and, indeed, in Western Australia. I think that those states have taken the right approach to the relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this inquiry we received many submissions, and all members of the committee have been receiving, especially over recent weeks, a lot of letters about human rights issues in Indonesia. There is an important point we have to make in that area, and no-one is denying that the human rights issues are very important, but our mandate was to inquire into Australia's relationship with Indonesia. Human rights are part of that but our brief was a much broader examination of the full gamut of the relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was fortunate to be a member of the October 1992 study tour involving 10 committee members. We did have a dedicated RAAF aircraft which meant we were able to see a great deal of Indonesia in the limited time that we had available. Therefore, after we had been to Jakarta where we had discussions with government ministers and various research bodies, we flew to eastern Kalimantan to inspect the large open coalmine in which CRA is a joint venturer. Representing as I do a coal producing area, I was particularly impressed with the potential and indeed the vastness and quality of the coal resource in Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went on to southern Sulawesi where we were briefed on fishermen from that province who fish in Australian waters. In Surabaya we attended the annual Australia-Indonesia Business Council meeting. Some of us inspected joint ventures with an Australian involvement, while others had discussions with graduates of Australian universities at Malang in East Java. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In West Timor we had discussions with Australian aid workers, including a family which had driven from Dili in East Timor to meet us. In Irian Jaya, we were briefed on that province and visited one of the transmigration camps which have been the subject of a lot of discussion both here and in Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it was a very busy trip, it was very well justified in terms of the report which has just been tabled. It gave us the opportunity to see more of Indonesia than most people have. The tour had a specific emphasis on the eastern provinces where Australia's assistance to Indonesia is focused, and it showed us something of the variety of Australian interests in Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important but least mentioned episodes of the study tour occurred in Jakarta. Some time ago this parliament's public works committee, of which I am chair, held an inquiry and tabled a report recommending the construction of a new Australian Embassy in Jakarta. One of our recommendations, which was accepted and included in the design, was the construction of an additional floor to the building. The bureaucrats fought this recommendation very strenuously, but the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) and I pushed it through because we wanted the additional floor to provide space for the likely expansion of staff in the embassy in the future. Such is the importance of Indonesia that we believed that the additional expenditure in construction would pay off quite soon. That has proved to be the case. The embassy was opened in August of this year and it is already full. So the decision that that committee took was justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study tour brought great benefits to those members who were on it, and I believe that the report benefited greatly from the tour. I certainly believe that the credibility of this report will be greatly increased because some of the members now understand more about Indonesia because of what they saw last year. </PARA>

<PARA>Earlier this morning the Clerk of the House of Representatives reported to the parliament on the petition I presented to him. That petition carried the signatures of almost 13,500 citizens. The petition prays that the House repeal the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940 and that those mariners then be covered under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, with the same benefits as those who served in the armed forces. The petitioners came from across the length and breadth of this nation. They joined members from both sides of the House in the struggle to correct the great inequity and injustice that has been done to Australia's wartime merchant mariners for almost 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week our nation witnessed the entombment of the Unknown Soldier at the Australian War Memorial. It was an event that honoured our war dead as well as those who have made other sacrifices in wartime. However, death or injury in war is not limited to those who serve in one of the recognised services. As a nation, we still fail to recognise the important and critical role that Australian merchant mariners played during the Second World War, especially during those dark days when supply lines to Australia and to war theatres were under enemy attack or threat of attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year we paid homage to the many Australians who made the ultimate sacrifice&mdash;in battles on land and at sea a half century earlier&mdash;that we may live free today.

Most Australians are aware of the deeds of the defence personnel involved in those events. Few Australians, other than those directly involved and their families, are aware of the sacrifices made, the agonies suffered or the deprivations and hardships endured by Australia's merchant mariners, the men who maintained the vital supply lines to Australia during those dire times throughout World War II. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I am moving this motion today and why colleagues on both sides of the parliament are supporting it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is undeniably clear that the spirit and intent of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act of 1940 has not been carried through. Under the act, merchant mariners have to prove that they suffered a war injury during war service, and the onus is on them to prove it. That might be easy if it could be shown that one lost a limb during one's service or under enemy attack, but first one had to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though there was enough evidence given to the 1989 McGirr inquiry, the fact is that ships' logs recording injuries were often lost in action or, in many cases, records were not kept because of the conditions under which the vessels were operating. Obviously, if the ship sank the records went down with it. Therefore, in many cases, the task of having to show that a war injury was suffered has been impossible to complete. The restrictive nature of the act has meant that fewer than five per cent of eligible Australian merchant mariners have been able to gain a disability pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me contrast that with the case of veterans covered by the Veterans' Entitlements Act of 1986.

<PARA>It is also indisputable that the narrow interpretation placed on the provisions of the act by the bureaucracy in intervening years has frustrated the original intent of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>In 1991 the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys), succeeded in having veterans' medical entitlements extended to wartime merchant mariners, and I applaud him for his efforts.

The widows of their departed comrades are similarly being denied justice. Mr J.D. Macansh, of Newcastle Legacy, has written to me expressing his support of the action we are seeking today. The fact is that only 36 widows, or three per cent of wartime mariner widows, have benefited under the 1940 act. That three per cent of mariners' widows receiving war widows pensions compares with about 70 per cent of widows of service personnel who receive war widows pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations of the McGirr report have the unanimous support of former merchant mariners, the RSL, other ex-service groups, Legacy, honourable members of both sides of this House, and the almost 13,500 citizens of this nation who signed the petitions presented to the House this morning.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed an honour and a privilege to rise in this place to provide a very large measure of bipartisan support to this commendable motion by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). It. recognises a group disadvantaged in the service of our country but sadly forgotten by most. I congratulate him and his 13,500 petitioners for their initiative, as indeed I did in speaking to a similar motion in this place about 18 months ago. It is a measure of the honourable member's commitment to correcting the serious anomalies that exist for some, despite the political and protracted rhetoric from responsible ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also salute all of those who served in uniform and in the merchant marine, and it is to the latter that we pay particular tribute today. Clearly there is continuing dissatisfaction about the broad anomaly which is reflected in the motion before us today, particularly parts (i) and (ii), which call for the repeal of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act, the SWPA Act of 1940, and for access to benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act of 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This dissatisfaction is reflected succinctly in a very short article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> about two years ago. For the benefit of the House, I will read part of that article, which was headed `Seamen not happy with pension deal'. It said that merchant navy mariners who worked in World War II war zones were angry because of inequities between their disability pensions and those of returned servicemen in the pension changes that were announced at that time by the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys). It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . mariners still do not qualify for disability pension unless their injuries can be directly attributable to a hostile attack during the war. All returned servicemen and women are paid the disability pension if they were injured during the war, whether it was during an attack or not. The disability pension, paid in addition to a service pension, is considered compensation for injuries . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allied Merchant Seamen Association spokesman, George Hansen, said the 1989 McGirr inquiry into the needs of mariners found evidence which justified repealing the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act. Mariners could then be covered under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, bringing them into line with returned servicemen.</PARA>
<PARA>With that as background, I think it is worth reading into the record some of the historical aspects of the attendant legislation. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, seamen's disabilities were covered by the combined effect of the Navigation Act, the Seamen's Compensation Act and awards of the Arbitration Court. Liability for payments associated with the rights conferred under these statutes and awards rested with the shipowners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Navigation Act provided for medical treatment and wages. The Seamen's Compensation Act provided workers compensation cover. In line with other compensation schemes, it removed the necessity for seamen to prove negligence on the part of the shipowner before liability could be established. Provision was made for the payment of weekly benefits where an injury resulted in an incapacity for work. It also provided for lump sum payments for specific injuries, reasonable medical expenses, death and funeral benefits. The act applied to seamen on ships registered in Australia or employed under articles entered into in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a general rule, compensation schemes and insurance agreements contain an exemption from liability for injury or damage caused by an act of God or an act of war. With the outbreak of World War II, additional measures were required to provide coverage for wartime circumstances. Hence we have the genesis of the SWPA Act of 1940, which provided for pensions and other benefits at Commonwealth expense for masters, officers and seamen employed in Australian merchant ships trading between a port of a state or territory of the Commonwealth and any other port. It also covered those employed on a lighthouse tender or pilot ships of the Commonwealth or of a state. The benefits in that legislation were available to these mariners if, while employed in their normal course of duty, they sustained a war injury resulting in death or incapacity, or were captured and detained by the enemy, or their effects were lost or damaged as a result of enemy action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SWPA Act also provided for pensions for dependants under certain circumstances. It was amended by several other pieces of legislation through 1942 and 1943, and in December 1943 the war cabinet authorised a grant of education benefits on the same lines as those available under the repatriation children's education scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Security (Wages of Seamen Detained by the Enemy) Regulations and the National Security (Additional Pensions and Allowances) Regulations expired in 1946. All claims for detention allowances and compensation for loss of effects, which were dealt with by the Department of Shipping and Transport, were disposed of within five years of the end of the war. In 1952, the National Security Act was repealed and the SWPA Act was also amended to provide statutory authority for certain benefits which had been granted during the war under National Security Regulations and war cabinet decisions. The former related to medical benefits, sustenance allowances and funeral grants; and the latter to grants of furniture to certain merchant mariners and dependants, and to eduction benefits to the children of certain mariners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, therefore, the amendments made to the SWPA Act after World War II have aligned the pension benefits available to Australian merchant mariners with changes made to the repatriation legislation&mdash;even if, in the early stages, there were some delays in making amendments to that act. In recent years, however, because the act adopts some provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act&mdash;in particular, the criteria for assessment of rates of pension&mdash;changes to the earlier act have been made at the same time as changes to the VEA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, in the SWPA Act we have a piece of legislation which, unless it is repealed&mdash;as the honourable member has said&mdash;and benefits are extended under the VEA 1986, will allow those injustices to persist. Those injustices will not disappear simply with the passage of time. I refer the House to the 1989 inquiry by the then Deputy President of the Repatriation Commission, Jocelyn McGirr, and to her report. I specifically refer to sections 6.29 and 6.32 of her report. Section 6.29 says, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inevitably, there is likely to be some time lag between the report of the inquiry being presented and considered, and action taken to implement the recommendations through legislative change. If there were to be an undue delay, the full intent of the report might be lost or the recommendations substantially modified between the time the decision is taken and the changes implemented.</PARA>
<PARA>I add to what the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) has quoted from section 6.32:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further injustice will result if undue delays develop.</PARA>
<PARA>I simply say to the present minister, Senator Faulkner, that we need a thorough and immediate review of the McGirr report. As a result of that review, hopefully, the minister and the government&mdash;and, indeed, particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;will see their way clear to make it up to a very disadvantaged group of people, albeit a relatively small group, for the disadvantages that they suffer. I hope that in cabinet Senator Faulkner will soon be pushing for the necessary repeal of these provisions and for the increased access to all benefits that many others enjoy&mdash;and rightfully so&mdash;under the VEA 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish by saying that a strong case exists to include many Australian merchant mariners as veterans under the VEA. The challenge clearly lies with Senator Faulkner, and I hope that he will take it up with vigour, and that my colleagues on both sides of the House are not back here in a year's time repeating the message for ageing and increasingly frustrated and desperate mariners. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

What has changed is that a few more have died. Others have grown older, but they are still unable to gain access to the same benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 as those who served in the armed forces. It has been put to me that, because merchant mariners were paid a higher rate than those serving in the armed forces, they are not now entitled to these same benefits. I reject this argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under government legislation, merchant seamen were not permitted to leave the service for the duration of the war. Yet members of the other three services were able to transfer from one to the other, if they did not like the one they were enlisted in.

I believe that the time is long overdue to introduce the necessary legislative action to give merchant mariners equal access to the benefits that are now rightly enjoyed and have been enjoyed for decades by former armed forces personnel under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Are we denying the role that the merchant mariners played in the struggle to save this country? Few countries in the world today or in the past have been so dependent on shipping to maintain essential lifelines as has Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a continuing failure to recognise the contribution that our merchant mariners made to the defence of this country and to the maintenance of the lifelines of this country. The merchant fleet has always had to work very closely with the navy and it still does today. I make the point again that these people were prepared to give their lives to maintain the necessary lifelines to and from this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mariners are currently covered by the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940. Under that act, merchant mariners have to prove that they suffered a war injury during war service. The onus is on them to prove it. That may be easy if they lost a limb in the course of service or if they were under enemy attack, but these people had to survive. Although there was enough evidence given to the McGirr inquiry, ships' logs recording such injuries have often been lost in action. Obviously, if a ship was lost later in the course of the war or in a later engagement, no records survived. In many cases, the task of having to show that a war injury was suffered has been impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That burden on the individual to prove the injuries makes it difficult for ex-merchant mariners to show that they have suffered as a result of wartime service&mdash;for example, lung cancer or other respiratory diseases. The restrictive nature of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act has meant that only three per cent of eligible Australian merchant mariners have been able to receive a pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range of wartime experiences of Australian merchant mariners was comparable with the experience of veterans of the Australian defence forces; indeed, in some cases, it was more than comparable. Australian merchant mariners went to sea in ships that were not designed for warfare. They had little or no armour plating. Many of the smaller ships were unarmed. A large merchant ship may have had a crew of around 100. A navy ship of comparable size would have had in excess of 500 persons including medical staff and facilities. The merchant seamen were constantly exposed to attack by submarines, surface raiders and aircraft, with the added risk of enemy mines laid in coastal waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of ships that were sunk has been detailed here today. Those ships were sunk in my own area off Jervis Bay and off the north coast&mdash;all around the Australian coastline. Indeed, of the 73 ships attacked in Australian waters during World War II, 54 were merchant ships and 38 of them went to the bottom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians served most of the war years on the dangerous Atlantic run on ships of various nationalities. These mariners were in particular danger. Enemy raiders were often given specific orders to avoid warships and to concentrate their attacks on the carriers of grain, petroleum, munitions and equipment to try to cripple the allied war effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, there were about 14,000 Australian merchant mariners engaged during World War II. The McGirr report estimated that 520 mariners lost their lives. This was roughly equivalent to the casualty lists amongst other servicemen. There seems to be no question that World War II Australian merchant mariners should be treated on an equal footing with the veterans of the defence forces. This means equal treatment in benefits and equal access to disability pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One point we have to bear in mind is that the future defence potential of this country relies very much on the merchant fleet and on civilians in the defence structure. We need only look at a couple of recent examples. Whatever we may think personally about the Gulf War or the Falklands War, in the Gulf War the United States had to rely on the merchant fleet to get much of its equipment to the Gulf, and the United Kingdom would not have been successful in the Falklands War had it not been able to use the merchant fleet. It is also important to note that all merchant seamen in the Falklands were volunteers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past few years much has been said, not least in this House, about Australian shipping. We have seen a restructuring of the seagoing union membership, a decrease in the number of crew, the introduction of multiskilling and the establishment of a career path for seamen. Australian ships today are crewed by well-trained, dedicated personnel, yet there remains a black mark that only the government can eradicate and that is the fact that governments will not grant Australian wartime merchant mariners their just entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the honourable member for Shortland for again bringing this motion before the House. I know, as other members of this House know, that he has had an interest in correcting this injustice for a long time, and this is not the first speech he has made on this topic.

It is obvious to state that the war, which affected so many Australian families, ended almost 50 years ago, and yet we have a continuing injustice within our community, for which many Australians took up arms 50 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian merchant mariners were a proud and hardy bunch for they fought their war through getting through the much needed supplies and resources our community needed. They were sometimes left alone on their vessels to sail to their ports without adequate protection, and many of the ships on which they served were sunk by the enemy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These mariners suffered the normal hardships of war while being separated from their loved ones. They faced the stresses of conflict and felt the degradation of war. They felt the rod of the prison master when they were confined to prisoner of war camps, although not all suffered this plight. Yet we learn that these silent heroes have not been adequately recognised for their service of their country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to note the thoughts of Mrs Beech of Kingsley, a constituent of mine in the seat of Cowan, whose family have a long and honourable tradition of serving their country. Mrs Beech was writing at the time of the Gulf War when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although it is very heart warming to see the men home safely from the Gulf War, I find it hard to come to terms with the fact that during World War II men and boys&mdash;some only 14 and 15 years of age&mdash;left the same shores as merchant seamen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They didn't have any send offs, they were not welcomed home by the Prime Minister and their pay was not increased.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is: give all who had to go a fair go. On a percentage basis, the merchant navy had the biggest casualty loss of all the forces. Seamen paid a vital part in the war. My husband was 14 when he left Fremantle. No doubt his mother and father felt the same anguish as the parents of those who left for the Gulf.</PARA>
<PARA>It is an indictment of our system of veterans' entitlements that it was not until 1989 that Australia's merchant mariners were entitled to limited benefits. In 1989 they were granted permission to use the rehabilitation hospitals and to obtain free dental and optometry care. Prior to 1989 they had never been recognised in any way for their service during wartime. Even today, full benefits have been denied to merchant mariners even if they had experienced disabilities caused as a result of wartime activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Allied Merchant Seamen's Association (WA Branch) is testimony to the poor treatment and suffering that have been inflicted upon these ex-servicemen. The Western Australian sub-branch comprises approximately 40 members, over 90 per cent of whom were torpedoed or taken prisoner of war while they served at sea. They were no older than 16 and 17 years of age at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One gentleman not only had to go through the trauma of being torpedoed at 16 years of age; he was also taken prisoner and interned in a prisoner of war camp in Java, where he celebrated his 17th birthday. He has had to endure the pain and suffering of not being recognised for his service until this year, over 50 years later, when he was granted a 100 per cent disability under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. It is a shame this gentleman had to endure his suffering long after the war had ended; it is a greater shame and embarrassment to some in Australia that many more still suffer and are not recognised for their outstanding war effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of seeking appropriate and equitable compensation for Australian mariners is not a new one. As far back as October 1989 Jocelyn McGirr issued her findings arising from the inquiry into the needs of Australian mariners, Commonwealth and Allied veterans and Allied mariners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report recommended, firstly, that Australian merchant mariners of World War II be provided with repatriation health benefits on the same basis as veterans of the Australian defence forces of World War II, including the provision of treatment for cancer and pulmonary tuberculosis; and, secondly, that Australian merchant mariners of World War I be provided with repatriation health benefits on the same basis as veterans of the Australian defence forces of World War I. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamental to this issue is the claim on the part of the Australian merchant mariners that because they have comparable service with veterans of the Australian defence forces they should have comparable entitlements. The inquiry report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry's conclusion is that the claim is justified. In line with this general conclusion the inquiry believes that the health needs of this group should be met in the same way as those of Australian veterans, and that there should be no distinction in access to treatment entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA>Although there was action to rectify the injustice regarding entitlements for these ex-servicemen, it seems that there was not enough. It is important that we reward our heroes in Australia; it is important that we recognise sacrifices for our country. We cannot continue to deny the rights of these mariners any longer. We need to right the wrong of such long standing and ensure that the mariners receive just recognition for the service they provided to our nation at its time of great need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While appearing to be a bit late for this, I wish to thank the merchant mariners for their service and contribution to our country and, on behalf of those Australians that care about this issue and about what happens to them, I support the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) and his motion. The motto of the merchant mariners was `Silent Service'. We should not allow them to suffer in silence any longer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak to the motion I acknowledge the long and dedicated hours of hard work that the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) has committed to this worthy cause, along with other members of parliament on both sides of the House. I also acknowledge the 13,500 petitioners whose concerns were reported to the House this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with the honourable member for Shortland there are many worthy individuals and groups who have also sought this particular form of justice for a long time, including various RSL groups and merchant mariner organisations. As a former merchant mariner myself&mdash;even if it was during the Korean emergency and not during the Second World War&mdash;I can assure the House that it was not any great bag of laughs running around with aviation spirits and with MiG fighters following. We had no protection whatsoever except from Royal Navy ships which had to cruise within 500 metres. There is a powerful argument for the support of this motion in the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August this year the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Faulkner, announced the establishment of an independent review of the veterans compensation pensions scheme. Included in the terms of  reference was the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">other compensation&mdash;related issues, including the standard of proof provisions with any associated statutory time limit; the existing scheme for seafarers; and the interface between disability and service pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, we have already had one review, as has been pointed out in the House today, called the McGirr inquiry, which reported in October 1989. So the umpire has already spoken.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The McGirr inquiry was established to look at the needs of Australian mariners, Commonwealth mariners and Allied and veteran mariners. It was the principal task of that inquiry to assess the level of benefits provided to Australian Second World War merchant mariners so as to determine whether they were comparable with the benefits provided by other countries. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also the task of the inquiry to determine whether Australian mariners were unfairly treated when compared to Australian veterans. The sad thing is that there is not much difference between the treatment of Australian mariners and mariners throughout the world. It was only recently that the government of the United Kingdom acknowledged in the national service act that mariners like me who did their apprenticeship in the merchant navy were entitled to the national service medal. The fact that was I sent there forcibly did not seem to make much difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So other countries are not much different from Australia. It takes a long time, and a lot of the people who have entitlements have unfortunately passed away. That is why it is so urgent that this wrong be righted in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The McGirr inquiry found that the range of experiences of Australian merchant mariners during the war was comparable with the experiences of the Australian defence forces. In fact, in some cases the experience of merchant mariners far outweighed those of their defence force counterparts, with some 520 losing their lives at a rate roughly equivalent to that amongst servicemen. Of course, there are no prizes for guessing what the conclusion of the McGirr inquiry was. Basically, the inquiry recommended that the level and range of benefits provided to Australian mariners should be the same as those provided to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final point relates to petitions to the House today. Clearly 13,500 petitioners is a large number. However, in relative terms it is simply overwhelming to receive that many signatures from across the country and across the political spectrum. It clearly shows the depth and breadth of the community's dissatisfaction with the way that those brave men and women have been treated. Without doubt, it is now time for us to do the right thing and recognise our responsibilities to those people. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thoroughly commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

So there is a hypocrisy there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The McGirr report found that the range of wartime experience of Australian merchant mariners was comparable with the experiences of veterans of the Australian Defence Force. It is clear from the McGirr report that it was the intention of the government of the day to bring the benefits available under the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940 into line, as far as practicable, with the benefits available to ex-servicemen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I spoke on this matter on 28 May last year, I did so with the conviction and knowledge that I had the support of the RSL right across Australia, and the Merchant Navy War Service League and 30 other ex-servicemen's groups, together with Legacy and war widows. I had one adverse reaction from an ex-serviceman who seemed to be hung up on the fact that there was still a belief that the merchant seamen worked for reward and not in the interests of the war effort. Yet I know that there are many merchant mariners who would have liked to have served in the armed forces but were physically prevented from doing so because of the acknowledged need for their services. Their effort in the war was absolutely essential, providing the resources that were required to wage that war and also transporting the manpower right across those seas. As the McGirr report indicates, they all took the same risks as anyone in the armed services would have taken, and in some cases they took more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an ex-mariner in my electorate, in Mackay, who has done a tremendous community service in so many ways. I have to pay tribute to Captain Red Faulkner, who served within the harbour facilities of Mackay after the war, in that he has persistently pursued action in this regard. His history is an interesting one. I believe that he would have liked to have worked within the RAN itself but was prevented from doing so. He was a man who had a ship sunk under him twice, and he was able to be saved and went back to what would have been then described as a fairly perilous occupation&mdash;yet no recognition has been given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had the records of the ships that have been torpedoed off our own coast and in our own ports. We must then describe this as a war zone. Irrespective of where those ships were, they were in constant danger. For one who has a fear of going under water, there is no way in the wide world I would be working under the waterline in any ship, let alone above it, and so I pay tribute to these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is the departmental attitude that really is the problem. It has been a saga as far as the department is concerned.

We sell $12 billion more to the Asian countries involved in the APEC forum than they sell to us, so there are great opportunities there which we are already taking advantage of. We can be held back only by a lack of power, particularly in local areas, to use local resources to advantage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people are not sovereign because in Australia we have 15 houses of parliament all making different rules. In 1978, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> said Australia was rotted by too much politics and was one of five overgoverned nations. In 1981, Milton Friedman&mdash;I know he is infra dig, but let us not throw away the rational part of economic rationalism&mdash;said Australia was the most cosseted economy on earth and riddled with restrictive controls, including state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have confusion and inefficiency, with a lack of coordination on issues such as the movements of criminals across borders, disputes about which police force is responsible for what, buck-passing between three levels of government on responsibilities for roads, and lack of recognition of a trade because a person comes from the wrong side of the border. I have heard of a highly qualified RAAF electronics engineer whose qualifications were not recognised in some states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had port reform held back because of state interference in the setting of prices at ports. We have had bank practices&mdash;and I think of the state banks of Victoria and South Australia&mdash;where the Reserve Bank has not had the power that it should have had to interfere. We have had monopolistic trade practices and doctors and lawyers dealing with those trade practices being held back because of the refusal of states to cooperate. We have had the huge frustration of industries, such as the fishing industry&mdash;a $1.2 billion industry&mdash;which is trying to work under a snarl of federal, state and local jurisdictions. In New South Wales at the moment the state jurisdiction is very much holding back on the problems in the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lack of cooperation on issues such as housing and industrial relations. We have got a proliferation of industrial relations rules so that when something unsatisfactory happens, as has happened in Victoria, people skip across to federal jurisdiction. Another issue is that we have had corporate legislation held back. All this is inefficient and costly. All our governments in Australia spend about $140 billion per year. Surely, by simplifying our procedures we can save at least $10 billion of that cost to taxpayers, businesses, householders and farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking of farmers, I mention that the recent mice plague in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia was believed to cost a huge $20 billion in South Australia alone. However, South Australia could tackle the problem with one particular poison but that poison was not allowed to be used in Victoria or New South Wales because those states operate under different poison laws. It is quite evident that mice do not recognise state boundaries, nor do feral pigs, dogs, cats, rabbits or goats. Neither should we, because all this holds back useful money for investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just the other day in the government party room, the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) raised the issue of regional development. He pointed out&mdash;as had Santos&mdash;that people were not able to compete across state borders, because of the proliferation of legislation regulations. The Santos people said they were not able to export across state borders because there were huge costs and different regulations which were holding them back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only recently, the desire of the federal and some state governments to get an eastern power grid together was contested. New South Wales and Victoria were finding difficulties with it, and they are holding back on cooperation&mdash;when we could have much lower costs, as we have with Telecom and Australia Post, through efficiency. If they separated the transmission from the supply of power, then we would have much lower costs. Not just millions, but hundred of millions of dollars&mdash;perhaps well over a billion dollars&mdash;could be saved to consumers. And all this has been held back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened as well is, of course, that we have had states competing for investment. We have had the give-away stakes, with Premier Bolte saying in Victoria some years ago that Westernport would be the Ruhr of Australia, and enticing John Lysaght Steel to set up at Hastings. He told the local council that it was to charge much lower rates, so that Lysaght could afford to do it. The council did not want to do so, and he put legislation through the parliament to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the Victorian government in the give-away stakes with Portland and Alcoa. We have had an attempt being made by the aluminium industry to entice the hydro-electricity commission of Tasmania in those give-away stakes, and all in the name of competition between regions. Of course we should have competition between regions, where you get the true perspective of costs and advantages, but that does not necessarily happen with our present state boundaries. No wonder overseas investors find the Australian market difficult to understand and difficult to penetrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry talked about multiple layers of government and overlapping jurisdictions leading to delays, inconsistencies and additional costs to business investment. That is absolutely and completely true. The CAI, in its support of federalism, called for sensitivity to regional preferences in policy development. Both the ACCI and the CAI support federalism, but it is stretching it to infer that the states are regions. The boundaries were drawn in the United Kingdom, perhaps a couple of centuries ago, so they are not natural regional boundaries. The natural regional boundaries are different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government needs to be reformed. We need to get away from the three tiers of government that we have at the moment. The Business Council of Australia called for having two tiers and pointed to the dangers of having three. Of course, they wanted the two tiers they were calling for to be completely separate. They seemed to be favouring strong regional government and strong national government, with each raising its own funds and spending them. I would rather have that than the present system of three tiers, but I do see in it some danger of people moving from one region to another to try to get better welfare benefits, or of people not being able to move and being strongly disadvantaged because they cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the Brisbane City Council and the Northern Territory, Tasmanian and Australian Capital Territory governments, which are all based on more natural regional boundaries and which can give us a lead in the logic of government. I believe that the Australian Capital Territory government, which has had a lot of criticism, is beginning to show us just how much better it is than the type of state governments that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need two levels of government in land management, because that is what has led to more corruption. We have 9,000 elected councillors all over Australia. Let us replace them with a few hundred full-time members of local government. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) pointed out that we could get comprehensive reform of building and development and save the economy a billion dollars a year, by getting together with local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can reform local government by transferring federal and state powers of administration, and passing social security and employment opportunities to local government, thereby making it much stronger than it is now. Since the turn of the century, the transfer of power has been done in such a way that powers have gone to the national government. But let us now see that the power goes to both state and national government. Prime Minister Menzies sought from the High Court in 1950 permission to do away with state immunity from Commonwealth legislation. That was granted by the High Court. Premier Fahey just recently called for more power over Loan Council borrowings by Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is happening all the time; it is happening almost naturally. The courts are doing it through tax and the corporations and external affairs powers. Aboriginal powers have gone to the federal government through a referendum. There has been increased cooperation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs a federal system of government, as do all nations covering a large land mass. Although Australia is an island, it is far from being one geographically, as the honourable member asserts. Consider the enormous geographic differences between, for example, the tropical areas of Far North Queensland and cool temperate regions like Tasmania and Victoria. The consequent infrastructures which have developed are vastly different from each other as one would understandably expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the ease of modern communications&mdash;the telexes, faxes, electronic mail, et cetera&mdash;a government special to each area is still needed. The whole ethos of each state, as developed historically, is different from that of all of the others. Other similar countries, like the United States, Canada and India, covering large land masses and containing different geographic regions, require and have federal systems of government. Even in Europe, where countries are relatively small and where unitary systems of government have generally been adopted, the biggest country geographically, Germany, has a federal system. The disintegration of the erstwhile USSR was caused not only by the collapse of European communism, but also by the breakdown of communications between the central government and its various provinces, particularly outlying ones like Latvia, Lithuania, Georgia, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to our own country, despite its binding language, the states of Australia have developed heterogeneously. Each state government has provided a distinct and much needed special representation to suit the particular region concerned. One of the best illustrations of the distinctive characters of the different Australian states as they have developed historically relates to the topic of land usage. The ramifications of the present extremely difficult problem facing Australia regarding the High Court's Mabo decision centre around the different land management regimes in each state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, the difficulty is minimal because only 0.04 per cent of the state is given to leasehold title and vacant crown land, whereas in Western Australia, Premier Richard Court is grappling with difficulties involving a state in which 69.8 per cent of the land is affected, 36 per cent being leasehold and 32.8 per cent being vacant crown land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever the necessity for continuing state governments to represent the interests of the people is evident, surely the case of Western Australia at the present time is the best possible example. I would very much doubt that the alternative of numerous local government entities as suggested in the motion would have the necessary clout to represent the Western Australian people as effectively. I would argue strongly that, far from reducing the sovereignty of the people, as part (1), clause (d) of this motion suggests, state governments increase and protect the sovereignty of the people. </PARA>

Some changes, particularly those in the area of transport, have been beneficial&mdash;and I concede that&mdash;but others have resulted in an unnecessary duplication in burgeoning bureaucracies. The two most obvious departments which spring to mind are health and education. Federal poaching in these two areas particularly is enormously and unnecessarily costly. I would trust that a future federal Liberal government would cut costs by transferring certain powers back to the states in these two important areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no criticism of local government council representatives&mdash;who, generally, are dedicated community activists, giving generously of their time and energy for little reward, as all of us in this place well know. However, over recent years there has been a massive and costly growth in local government bureaucracy. Ambitious city managers have poached the territory of state governments, particularly in the welfare area. In the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> of August 29 this year, an article entitled `Top job salaries a shock to ratepayers' stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some council managers will be in the same pay bracket as the N.S.W. Premier and Federal Government Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA>It stated further in that article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At least two Sydney councils are offering packages adding up to $150,000.</PARA>
<PARA>Ku-ring-gai Mayor, Peter Derwent, is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know of two other councils where the package is $150,000. I talked to a country mayor yesterday and he was talking of offering their general manager $170,000.</PARA>
<PARA>Before dispensing with (1) (d), I would like to point out that corruption is not confined to state governments. We often hear of graft at local level, as in the case of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> article of 12 March of this year entitled `Jobs for the boys row has a deja vu feel'. The article names the Labor Mayor of Liverpool, Alderman Mark Latham, as responsible for awarding a $46,000 a year research appointment to ALP colleague Peter Primrose, former Lord Mayor of Campbelltown and state MP for Camden. The selection committee comprised Latham, on a $25,000 allowance plus a car, and general manager John Walker, who was on a salary of $130,000. Apparently, the appointment was kept from other councillors. Another alderman, Tony Pascale, commented:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in seconding this motion. The three-tier system of government in this country is now totally anachronistic. The state structure made sense in 1901 because there was relatively little interaction between the various major population centres in our country and we had relatively self-contained economies and societies operating in the then six colonies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent revolution in transport and communications, which the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) has referred to, has broken down these barriers, particularly in the past 10 to 15 years. We have cheaper air fares, cheaper phones, fax machines, video conferencing, better cars and a whole range of mechanisms which ensure that the degree of interaction between the various parts of our country is infinitely greater than it used to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 10 years, the volume of interstate road freight has doubled. In the past 20 years, the number of domestic air passengers&mdash;the majority of them, of course, being interstate&mdash;has trebled. In the Hilmer report on national competition policy, this situation was very adequately summed up:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is for all practical purposes a single, integrated market. The economic significance of state and territory boundaries is diminishing rapidly as advances in transport and communications permit even the smallest firms to trade around the nation.</PARA>
<PARA>Everything is becoming more national: television networks; business activity; tourism; social activity; and sporting competitions in all the major sports, which is something that was unheard of 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retention of our three-tier system of government now means that we have eight separate systems of law in the critical areas of criminal law, libel law, consumer law, road laws, food and beverage standards, occupational qualifications and environmental laws. We therefore have enormous amounts of resources, time and energy being devoted at the different levels of government to trying to achieve uniform regulations in many of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must come a point when we step back and say, `In this welter of uniform national regulation being developed in so many areas, why is it that, if it is so important that we do have uniform national regulation, we retain the constitutional power to make these regulations in the states and therefore allow a lowest common denominator right of veto in all these areas?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no better recent example of this issue than the squabble over national education policy where, in spite of the clear support by business across the country for the development of uniform national education standards, two recently elected conservative state governments decided to gum up the works for a period of time. That is a classic illustration of the rapidly increasing irrelevance of state governments in these areas of genuine national significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have overlapping and duplicatory planning and regulatory regimes. There are many horror stories which are often used as examples to illustrate problems with regulations per se. These are examples of business being unable to pursue legitimate development of often quite simple and straightforward things just because there are too many tiers of government, too many regulatory bodies and nightmares of bureaucratic duplication and obstruction. That is very much a product of having three tiers of government, and road funding is a classic example of where these sorts of anomalies lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distribution of powers, logical as it may well have been in many respects in 1901, is now clearly out of step with the needs of national government. The need for the federal government to use export powers with respect to nationally significant environmental issues is an obvious example of the absurdity of our system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of international conventions, which is so decried by those on the other side of the House, is simply a device which is forced upon the government in order to acquire the power to legislate. The vast majority of national governments across the rest of the world already have that power through the normal constitutional arrangements in those countries. It is not some sort of grand, international conspiracy with the United Nations thought police at the door; it is simply a mechanism to ensure that the national government can legislate on matters of national importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my friend the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) has pointed out, we have the absurdity of umpteen different industrial relations systems, both at the federal and the state level, across the country. That is an illustration of the manifestly ridiculous nature of our structure of government. A better illustration would be hard to find. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The boundaries are absurd. Substantial parts of New South Wales economically and socially relate more to major centres in other states than to Sydney. The boundaries do not reflect real aggregations of social and economic interests and activities. We also have some of the ultimate absurdities like the fact that we cannot seem to get our act together on time zones and we have different state governments doing different things at different times. We have even managed to celebrate Australia Day on different days depending on which state we are in. We are possibly the only country in the world to manage that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is not, as is often said, about more power to Canberra. I commend the honourable member for Deakin for his relatively rational presentation, because often we hear from the other side of the House hysterical outbursts about how this is some sort of grand conspiracy to build a gigantic, bureaucratic behemoth in Canberra, as was said by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) in a previous debate on this issue in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is not about more power to Canberra, because it would be appropriate for most of the functions of state governments to go to regional governments; so they would go down the hierarchy and not up. The ACT government, which does have its faults&mdash;as all governments do&mdash;is a very good working model, although it is still in its infancy, of how a two-tier system can function quite effectively in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion that the states and the Senate have functioned as protectors of the interests of the less populated regions in this country I would also challenge. I regard it as a myth. Contrary to what the honourable member for Deakin said, we are, compared with the rest of the world, a remarkably uniform people across our large continent. Political divisions within our community have almost invariably been across state boundaries and within states, not between states. This is why the Senate has not been a states house, because the vast bulk of issues we have had to deal with, the great issues that have divided the nation, have also divided people within their states and have occurred across state boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no Quebec, we have no Georgia or Uzbekistan to follow the Soviet Union example, and we have no Scotland. We are quite a uniform people. What this has meant is that neither of the major political forces can possibly hope to govern in this country nationally if they actively discriminate against one significant part of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that if the opposition's view of the Mabo debate is accurate then we will lose government because we need to win seats in Western Australia. There has not been a government in the history of this country that has governed nationally without seats in Western Australia. What that reflects is the relative uniformity of our population across the country. There is no state that votes 80 per cent Liberal and 20 per cent Labor or vice versa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would appeal to people in the opposition to have a look at their traditional backers in the business community like the Business Council of Australia or like many of those businesses engaged in national and international economic activity and listen to them. What they are saying is, `We are tired of the inefficiency that is brought by this three-tier system of government, we want micro-economic reform in the area where it is most critical'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To those on my own side who have some nervousness about this issue, and there are inevitably some, I would just like to conclude by quoting a very great former Labor Prime Minister. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I favour abolition of State Parliaments and greatly extended powers being given to local governing authorities. . . It is said that this proposal represents a revolutionary change, but to regard a great change as something fraught with dire danger is not always a sign of wisdom; it is more often a sign of a parish-pump mind. . . If it is carried it will be because the seeds of national unity which were planted at the time of federation have at last come to flower.</PARA>
<PARA>It may surprise members to know that that was not Gough Whitlam or Bob Hawke; it was Ben Chifley speaking in this House in 1930. I would commend his views to honourable members. I think they sum up the situation very well. It is time that our community fully grew to its potential and that we shed the last vestiges of the colonial structure which we have inherited, which no longer reflects the genuine economic and social structure of our society and which now inhibits economic efficiency to a considerable extent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us deal with that. He proposes to abolish the state and territory governments, to pass all executive responsibility to the federal government in Canberra, to abolish the present 911 local government authorities and replace them with something fewer than 100 regional authorities, and to bring representatives from the regional authorities into the Senate. In other words, the honourable member would have us abolish Australia's federal system in favour of a single all-powerful Canberra based government with up to 100 major population centres being administered by a form of municipal government, and with representatives from those municipalities, presumably, replacing the state representatives in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing his case, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro makes the claim that state governments should be abolished because they hinder rather than encourage good government, they increase the opportunity for corruption, reduce responsibility and accountability and reduce the sovereignty of the people. What we really heard from the honourable member for Melbourne was the basis of this. He finished his speech by talking about vestiges of colonialism. He was not talking about good government; he just has this matter in the back of his mind that somehow all we inherited from the British Crown has to be abolished, set aside, got rid of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presumably the 50, 60 or 100 regional authorities of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro will be immune from failures of corruption, reduced responsibility and accountability, and all of those terrible things that he believes may be associated with the present system. I think it would have greatly assisted the House if the honourable member for Eden-Monaro had provided an explanation why his scheme would do away with all those demerits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also claims that the three levels of government are excessive for a nation which geographically, demographically and socially is one. I do not really believe that a member of this parliament is naive enough to suggest that the sixth largest country in the world, an area of about 8 million square kilometres, 4,000 kilometres from Perth to Sydney and the same from Darwin to Hobart, is geographically one. Except in the sense that it is an island state, it is not geographically one. It differs very greatly in its geography from one part to another, and it is absolute nonsense, I believe, to talk about a demographic oneness of the Australian people. What is true is that, despite the diversity of our geography and our people, we are one nation, a nation which we can be very proud of for having successfully integrated millions of immigrants into an incredibly cohesive and tolerant society with a strong and unique sense of nationalism. But that cohesive sense of nationalism or oneness is no basis, in my view, for forcing us into a single giant central government; quite the reverse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we have got one national government with the power over all the others, we have centralised power in Canberra. Whichever way the honourable member likes to dress it up, that is the practical result of it. More to the point, the very diversity and size of the nation means that the most effective democracy occurs when people can directly involve themselves in the matters which affect their day-to-day wellbeing, that is to say, a decentralised system which reaches right into and operates at the community level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is wrong to claim that his scheme will be more democratic. How can people be more democratically represented when he would remove much of their municipal representation, abolish their state governments and create this Canberra bureaucracy? That is a scheme to create remoteness, and it must inevitably worsen the quality of democratic representation. Similarly, the honourable member has failed to convince me that his scheme will in itself improve efficiency and reduce corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We often hear it stated that we are over-governed, and the honourable member used this argument to justify his radical proposal. However, there is undeniable evidence that we are not over-governed by international standards. If we take the number of parliamentary representatives, both national and state, in the major Western nations, and include Japan, and express them as a ratio of population per representative, we find that Australia has the lowest representation, which will come as a great surprise to a lot of people. The figures are: Australia, 20.3 persons per representative; Canada, 23.4; United Kingdom, 31.4; USA, 31.7; Japan, 34.0; and New Zealand, 34.8. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has made much of the inefficiencies of local government. I can see that in the 1950s and 1960s there was a widespread concern about many aspects of our local authorities, for example, the level of professionalism, a propensity for corruption, and all too evident signs of inefficiencies. However, over the past 20 years these problems have been addressed through the appointment of qualified people who have improved professionalism, a greater involvement in councils, the provision of community and welfare services, and better public access to the workings and decision making of councils. As well, I believe that there is a greater willingness by state governments to enforce and encourage administrative standards and effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are legitimate concerns about aspects of the local government system, such as very small councils which are not economically viable. There is concern about some voting practices and there is a need for vigilance over administrative standards and the propensity for corruption. However, compressing 911 councils into 100 or less regional authorities, as the honourable member seeks to do, will not overcome these problems and may well create their own sets of new problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider this proposal for a moment, because it is unclear to me just where these 50, 60 or 99 authorities are to be located. If it were one to each of the top 50 most populated areas of Australia, that would leave hundreds of fair-sized cities without any municipal representation. Or could it be that our population of 18 million-odd is to be divided into 50 authorities, each representing 360,000 people? In that event, we would get about 10 authorities covering the greater Sydney area and one covering the whole of New South Wales west of the ranges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is mesmerised by the economies of scale that are implied in these large operating units. I would refer him to studies which show that economies of scale in terms of administrative costs are optimised at a population of about 10,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, cost is only one factor in determining municipal representation. For example, a regional authority located at Orange, with the responsibility for the entire western slopes and plains of New South Wales, might operate at maximum cost efficiency but could ultimately fail because of its remoteness from the majority of its clients. In fact, if the honourable member created such a structure, I predict that the Orange authority would quickly be creating subregional authorities to service the needs of larger cities and towns within its area of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member would have us go full circle. He abolishes the state governments and almost all municipalities to satisfy his `overgoverned' complaint, and then he finds that his new structure can work effectively only by creating an administrative system almost identical, but with different names, to the one that he has abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look more realistically at the economy of scale research, its message is clear. Successful municipal reform should be concentrated on amalgamating and restructuring those municipalities which service a population of something less than 10,000 people. When it comes down to the practical aspects of these things, not all wisdom resides in Canberra. There is a need for a diversion of power. Federal ministers need the leavening effects of opposition for some of their more harebrained schemes&mdash;and I am talking about ministers on both sides of the political fence.

<PARA>This motion we put before the House today demands bipartisan support, but I fear that that will not be the reaction of government members. It should be supported because the Labor government, in a blatant and discriminatory manner, has allocated from the federal budget $1.2 million of taxpayers' funds to the Republic Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a country that is proud of its democracy and its sense of justice and fair play, this appropriation is, in every sense, offensive and repugnant. Why is it offensive? Firstly, on any matter where a referendum will eventually be necessary, it has been the convention in the Australian democracy that both sides of the argument should have the equal opportunity to express their opinion. Both sides should have been funded publicly or, as the current economic climate would demand, no public funding should have been given at all. But the committee was publicly funded, and the other party against the proposition received not one single cent or any encouragement whatsoever. Indeed, the most responsible body to carry the other side of the argument, Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, has been left to seek its own funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the funding by taxpayers of this proposition means that over 50 per cent of Australians who support the current constitution and monarchy have to contribute to the funding of a view which they condemn. This is at a time when those same taxpayers are being asked to fund the other whims of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) such as child care, a Thai teak dining table and lithographs for the cabinet room: things which can only be described as gross indulgences. The people of Australia should&mdash;and do&mdash;say no to the extravagances of the Prime Minister at a time when Australians and Australian industries are still wallowing in debt and when this country has a record unemployment rate of 11.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost to this nation of the Prime Minister's predetermination to go down the path of a republic does not stop at $1.2 million. For instance, where within the appropriations were the costs of these published reports covered? Where did they cover the costs of the administration of the program, which seems to have taken up such an inordinate amount of time? Who pays for the National Media Liaison Service and the other government press which are committed to the republican debate? Who pays for the salary of David Hill and the ABC to promote a republic?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worst of all, who covers the damage done to this country in terms of trade and loss of respect through the Prime Minister and his ilk on their many visits overseas sounding off against Australian institutions? The cost is not $1.2 million. It runs into tens of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Years ago, when he was Treasurer, the Prime Minister talked about Australia becoming a banana republic. It only remains for the republic part of that prediction to come true. I do not denigrate the character of those who genuinely feel that a republic is worthy of consideration as we approach the centenary of Australia's Federation in 2001. However, why are those people worthy of consideration for funding whilst the members of the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy are not? Can those people come up with one good reason for Australia to change its democratic system under the monarchy to a democratic system under a republic?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After two years, the Prime Minister has not been able to give one proper reason, and yet he has removed the process of democracy from this chamber itself. However, a unanimous decision about a republic has not as yet been made within the Labor Party, as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) willingly testifies here on occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one change that Australia needs at the moment. It is not a change of the flag. It is not a change of the constitution. All that is needed is a change of government. It is interesting to look at the latest polls. It appears that the Prime Minister himself is our greatest advocate, as far as the polls are concerned, for our staying a democracy. Late last month, the Melbourne Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A newspaper readers' survey yesterday showed 77 per cent against the Prime Minister Paul Keating's plans for Australia to become a republic by 2001.</PARA>
<PARA>So it looks as though our best advocate is the Prime Minister himself. Surely, the main factor in this debate is the manner in which we, as the elected members, can protect and maximise the democratic right of all Australians under our constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our monarchy protects that democracy through the non-political appointment of a head of state. As with the governor-generals in the past, I believe that the current Governor-General, His Excellency the Hon. William George Hayden, knows those responsibilities and I believe that he would exercise those responsibilities impartially for the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, that democracy is further protected by an independent High Court of seven judges. Also, in addition to the House of Representatives where governments are formed, the Senate acts as a check and balance of the excesses of the executive of the day and, for example, that goes to the recent budget. Lastly, elections every three years are also a great check on government excesses. A republic cannot have a minimalistic position; either the democracy is retained or it is weakened, and that is what Australians will do by transferring to a republic, as our advisory committee has recommended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, the presidency will be a political appointment, beholden to a parliament or an electorate. The head of state would only be a figurehead. Will the states be preserved or will they, as the originators of the current federation, suddenly become the casualties of a republic? The previous debate suggests that is still Labor's policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, will the check of the Senate remain or will it be dispatched to the annals of history as the Labor Party policy appears to suggest? All I can say is, in no way will a change enhance the democratic right of ordinary Australians. The recent comment of Senator Gareth Evans that a republic would enhance the recognition of a president as the head of state is absolute rubbish. He used as his example the Governor-General's visit to the French war graves in September. With all due respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, what else would honourable members expect from the French?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate, there is often expressed an opinion that eventually or inevitably Australia will become a republic. This is the softer line pushed by the potential republicans. In my mind, there is no inevitability; we should not change for change's sake. We too often see these days that change rejects traditions and principles and morals and comes up with fewer and worse standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will return to the work of the report of the Republic Advisory Committee and the questions it asked. These referred only to matters of the removal of all references to the monarch and, in the light of that, the need for and the creation of a new office of the head of state and the provisions for such appointment, and so on. In no way were questions required to be answered as to whether people wanted to stay within the monarchy itself. For the expenditure of $1.2 million, it was entirely unbalanced. If it was balanced, it would have sought an opinion from people on the retention of the current constitution or on any suggested changes that might have been recommended to that constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was inevitable, when that committee met in public in Mackay on 12 July last year, that it was attended by some 50-odd citizens. That was a large number in comparison to other meetings. I understand, from those who attended the meeting, that all but the speaker and about two other citizens demanded to know why they could not discuss the retention of the present constitution&mdash;a constitution they were proud to have, to uphold and to retain. The whole argument for a republic and the argument for a change of our flag is but a diversion by a government who knows that it has no runs on the board for the economy, for debt, for employment, for the people&mdash;for children and families in poverty&mdash;and for the advancement of our underprivileged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was heartening to be present at the return of the Unknown Soldier just one week ago, 75 years after Armistice Day. To have returned to Australia a person representing the 60,000 dead from World War I reminded us that this soldier and all Australian soldiers fought, and some died, for the principles of democracy and freedom. They fought for a monarch and a constitution; they fought for their family and loved ones. For the brief time of that ceremony, I compared the Australia that the Unknown Soldier died and fought for with the Australia of today. I knew then that there should be no inevitability of change and no change whatsoever because that flag and that constitutional monarchy best serves me and my family today as it did my father and mother and their family 75 years ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an absurd motion because it is based on a widespread misunderstanding of the task that was actually bestowed upon the Turnbull committee by the government. It may be a fairly subtle distinction for some on the opposition benches to come to grips with but, believe it or not, the role of the Turnbull committee was not to promote the idea of a republic. The role of the Turnbull committee was to investigate options as to how a republic could be brought about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question it was charged with answering was not why, but how. The question it had to deal with was what were the mechanical problems&mdash;the logistical difficulties&mdash;of actually introducing a republic. The presumption behind the task of the committee was that the government is committed to proceed down that path. Honourable members may well recall that, in the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) prior to the election on 13 March, this is precisely what was promised&mdash;that a committee would be established to investigate the mechanisms whereby Australia could become a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Turnbull committee's job was to go out into the community to consult&mdash;which it did&mdash;about the options, about whether we should have an elected head of state or an appointed one, about how one would deal with the problem of the state governors if Australia became a republic, and about what powers the head of state should have. It was about the details. That was what its task was. It was not to go out and promote the virtues of becoming a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there were the occasional comments made by people like Malcolm Turnbull, they were perfectly entitled to make them. What they were engaged in doing was examining the constitutional complexities, the options for things like the method of appointment and powers of the head of state and the problems associated with state governments in Australia becoming a republic. That was their task. The line of argument that is put forward today by the opposition is deliberate obfuscation by those who are smart enough to realise these subtleties, and for those who are not it is just simply that they are enshrouded in a cloud of mysticism and nostalgia for the past that is no longer relevant to today's needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Turnbull committee was quite logically headed by a republican because of the very task that it had to fulfil. No doubt if in the dim, distant future honourable members opposite ever come to government and set up a committee to inquire into deregulation of the labour market, it would be unlikely that somebody like John Halfpenny would be appointed to head the committee. It would have been absurd for us to appoint a monarchist to head that committee that was inquiring not into whether or not a republic should be brought about but into how such a change would be brought about and what sort of difficulties and obstacles there were, constitutionally, to bringing about that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So those monarchists who are around saying that it was an outrage that money was not given to monarchists in this process are being deliberately misleading. The issue that was being examined was not whether or not we should become a republic, the issue that was being examined was how. Clearly, one does not need to conduct a major inquiry into how to keep the status quo. The answer is very simple: do nothing. There is no need to have equality on these two fronts because, in order to examine the questions of fairly complicated change, there must be widespread community consultation and examination. There is no need for a detailed examination of how to retain the status quo, the alternative. I would argue that the Turnbull committee did an excellent job and it discharged its functions as it was supposed to do and, in doing so, it managed to sweep aside some of the more absurd furphies that have surfaced in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, it swept aside the suggestion that republics are by definition unstable and that monarchies are inherently stable. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience throughout the world demonstrates that there is no necessary relation between a country's political stability or economic success and the nature of its head of state.</PARA>
<PARA>There are examples of successful and stable republics and successful and stable monarchies. There are unsuccessful and unstable republics and unsuccessful and unstable monarchies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the postwar period we have seen the two major defeated powers, Germany and Japan, both become economic giants. One is a republic, one is a monarchy. If one looks at the economic tigers in Asia, some are monarchies, some are republics. Perhaps the opposition is suggesting that the solution to the problems in Russia is that we might bring back the tsar or maybe anoint King Boris the First. Perhaps that would solve the problems there, and that really would sort everything out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Turnbull committee has also demonstrated that the notion of introducing a republic in Australia being constitutionally impossible is absolute nonsense. For example, it has been suggested by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) amongst others that the phrase in the covering clauses `indissoluble Commonwealth under the Crown' means that there was some form of contract entered into whereby the states&mdash;or the colonies as they then were&mdash;in effect entered into a contract which meant that the Crown had to be retained as the head of government in order for federation and the constitution to be retained. Overwhelming legal opinion as referred to in the Turnbull committee report shows that this is a ludicrous interpretation of the covering clauses and that there is no constitutional impossibility whatsoever to Australia becoming a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also laid to rest the suggestion, which the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) gave a bit of a run before, that there is some sort of hidden agenda in all this process. The suggestion was that in some way we could have a nice, benign, minimalist referendum about republican change, and then wake up the next morning and suddenly find that the states have disappeared, or that the Senate has suddenly disappeared&mdash;magically and mysteriously. It is an extraordinary suggestion, because honourable members opposite all know as well as I do that, for any change of that nature, we would have to have the same process: a referendum, a decision amongst the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support that change; but to suggest that in some way that will happen by stealth behind the scenes, just because we change the method of election of our head of state, is manifest scaremongering and absurdity. How could such an agenda be hidden? It is an absolutely ludicrous proposition to suggest to the people of Australia, and it is an insult to their intelligence. The motion that we have before us today reflects the level of paranoia that is abroad amongst many of the monarchist elements in our community, and their willingness to try to build up scares to frighten people about change. All sorts of absurd nonsense is being put forward in support of an increasingly indefensible status quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am interested to hear the honourable member for Dawson quote the one opinion poll that had a very biased structure, in that the poll referred to `Mr Keating's republic'. I would suggest that he also have a look at some of the other opinion polls, which show overwhelming majority support for moving to a republic. They also show that the younger the age group, the higher the support for a republic; so that support is simply going to keep growing. The opposition had better get used to the idea that at some stage Australia will become a republic; that at some stage we will grow up and become an independent nation in our own right. These things will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be far better for the Liberal Party and the National Party to learn from their mistakes in the Mabo debate, where they have been left sitting high and dry, with most of the supporters and interest groups that have traditionally backed them actually now supporting the government's position, and some of their own states backing the government's position. The opposition is going to end up in the same set of circumstances in this debate, where gradually some of the more rational and intelligent forces on the conservative side of politics in this community will realise&mdash;as many such as Nick Greiner and Peter Collins have already realised&mdash;that we should approach these issues with rationality and logic, and without trying to frighten people with scaremongering that there is some sort of incredible communist conspiracy of nasty reds under the beds, and all the usual stuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition should approach the issues on their merits, argue them out and consider what the options are. Consider, for example, the very serious question which I think is one that is going to be very important to the debate, of whether our head of state should be directly elected by the people, or appointed by the government, or elected by the parliament in some way. There are arguments either way on those issues, and they should be properly debated. By taking the position it is taking, the opposition is removing itself from that debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would urge everyone to participate in that debate, because that will help to form the political and governmental structure of this country for a long time to come, when this referendum is eventually put and this nation does decide to become republic. We will get a better result on those issues if all the major forces in our community participate in the debate, rather than putting their hands over their eyes and saying, `No! We don't want any part of this; this is all outrageous! It is change; it is all terrible!'. The opposition should participate in the debate on these issues on their merits and make a contribution. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to support the motion proposed by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), and I draw to the attention of the House the approach taken to the debate by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). He has fallen into the trap of getting into the debate about the republic and the constitutional monarchy and not addressing the fundamental issue of the funding of the Republic Advisory Committee and the government's approach to this whole matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The republican debate is a classic case of one group&mdash;those in favour of destroying Australia's internationally respected and successful constitutional monarchy&mdash;being funded by taxpayers, as a direct result of the dislike by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of anything that is even remotely connected with Britain. The opposing view&mdash;that Australia's existing system of government works well&mdash;is advanced by a group called Australians for Constitutional Monarchy. ACM now has over 6,500 active subscribers to its charter, yet that group has not received a single dollar of government funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 26 May this year the Prime Minister informed the honourable member for Indi, in answer to a question on notice, that the estimated cost of the Republic Advisory Committee was about $280,000. The real cost proved to be far in excess of that. In an answer on 26 October to questions asked by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and me, the Prime Minister said that the budgeted cost of the Republic Advisory Committee was $390,000. This was more than $100,000 over the Prime Minister's original estimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the committee could not even stick to its own budget. Although the opposition has been provided with the committee's expenses only up to 15 October, the Prime Minister has acknowledged that this little taxpayer funded baby of his spent at least $410,000 in less than six months of its life up to 15 October when it was disbanded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Chairman of the Republic Advisory Committee, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, declined to accept the $271 a day sitting fee laid down by the Remuneration Tribunal, other members of the committee had no such reservations. In total, committee members have claimed $11,400 in sitting fees. Two committee members, Miss Lois O'Donoghue and Ms Mary Kostakidis, are employed by ATSIC and SBS respectively and hence could not claim these fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The six members who did receive almost $2,000 each on average had their hotel bills paid, travelled business class by air and in hire cars and taxis. In contrast, Australians for Constitutional Monarchy representatives have always travelled economy class in planes as their funding comes overwhelmingly from public donations in $10 and $20 lots. Their largest single cash donation has been $2,500, a drop in the ocean compared with the public largesse received by the Republic Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I object to most about the workings of the Republic Advisory Committee is that, because two of its members, the chairman, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, and Dr John Hirst are members of the Australian republican movement and Professor George Winterton was a founding supporter, they have a position before they even started. So, despite its brief that it was to describe only the minimum steps that Australia would be obliged to take to become a viable federal republic, it could be said that the republicans had the advantage of a troika of representatives, whereas the opposing argument had no such status within the Republic Advisory Committee to ensure that there was another intrinsic view. </PARA>

But, unfortunately, with the contents of this motion, he is displaying an amazing lack of credibility. He seems to have ignored totally what the reality is with regard to the committee chaired by Mr Turnbull, the Republic Advisory Committee.

He argues that somehow we need to be giving equal pay and equal time to this group called Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy when we have not yet in fact engaged in any public debate. Honourable members opposite should wait until the public debate starts, because that is when they will really start seeing the juggernauts for change rolling over them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion is just the last gasp by the declining number of constitutional monarchists in this place and in this country. The fact is that they know they are on a loser; they know that they are not going to win this debate; they understand that the majority of people of Australia want change and are not frightened of change and, despite all of the fears and phobias that they are trying to build up and all the various peaks of hysteria that they have managed to drag out in this debate, the people of Australia are going to accept change. The people think it is time for change, and we are not going to cling to these old vestiges of the past that are represented by the monarchy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are actually going to have fairness and equity in this debate, if we are going to have balance, the campaign for a republic, when and if that gets under way, should receive quite a few millions of dollars from the government, since the fact is that the government in its budget each year allocates millions of dollars to the constitutional monarchy. It does that through the office of Governor-General, and it does that through the fact that it pays for royal visits. I understand there is going to be a royal visit here next year, that Prince Charles will be coming out to Australia next year and we will be spending hundreds of thousands of dollars taking him around, showing him around to the people of Australia. That is the government's responsibility, but that is therefore spending money promoting the constitutional monarchy. If we are going to have a fair share we should have, at the same time as we are funding Prince Charles to be flown around, one of the republican people flying around also saying how silly the constitutional monarchy is. Let us get some rationality into this debate. The fact is that we spend millions of dollars supporting the constitutional monarchy and very little money has been spent by the government or by anybody on promoting the alternative procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my friend the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) outlined, we are trying to get some framework within which we can then engage in the debate. This motion is pre-empting what might in fact be the political process that occurs. We have not started the debate yet. Sure, there have been discussions and people have expressed a couple of points of view, but we have not really got into the body of the debate about having a republic or not. When and if that debate occurs, that is the appropriate time to talk about what allocations of financial support there will be to the various causes. In every referendum in this country the yes case and the no case have had equal funding. That has always been the process in a referendum and it will be the case, I am sure, in this referendum when we get started. All honourable members opposite know that that is a requirement and that that is what will occur. The yes case will be funded and the no case will be funded equally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not what this is about. When we are going to have a referendum, we must have some basis upon which to debate it, and that is what the Republic Advisory Committee was about&mdash;setting out the options so that there can be some understanding of the issues. We do not need to understand the issues with regard to the constitutional monarchy; we have had it for 93 years. People know all about it and they know its weaknesses and its failures. But they do need to know what the issues are in addressing a republic and the concept of a republic, and that is what the government has done. The government has acted very responsibly.

The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) attacked it by saying it was an absurd motion because the issue was not why but how. If that is true, all I can say is that the government has put the cart before the horse. If it is a question of how but not why, the first question that should be answered is: why change? Why do we need a change? What are the benefits? Where is the current system falling down? Where does the current system fail Australian citizens? It does not, but we have got this impression of inevitability being promoted by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others on his side that is starting to brainwash people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Melbourne said we have paranoia on this side of the House. I know where the paranoia is: it is on that side of the House. It is related to 11 November 1975 when the Governor-General dismissed the Whitlam government, and the whole push for the republic stems from the Labor Party's paranoia over that issue. As I said, honourable members opposite have put the cart before the horse; they have got it all wrong. The honourable member for Melbourne said that quite logically the committee is headed by a republican. The reason why the committee is headed by a republican is that it is a matter of, `Do not confuse them with the facts, I have already made up my mind'. That is quite obvious. It is absolutely true that the committee should not be engaging in any debate promoting the republic. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) said that it was not engaging in any public debate promoting the republic. I say to the honourable member for Moreton that he could have fooled me. All of the publicity committee members got as they went right around Australia, at the expense of the people of Australia, was in fact promoting a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put another point to honourable members opposite. My good friend the honourable member for Moreton in the debate a few minutes ago spoke about fairness and equity. Honourable members on the other side are always proclaiming their fairness, their equity, their love of justice. We share that on this side, but in this instance there has been no fairness, no equity and no justice, because taxpayers' money is being used to fund one side of the debate. The reason that has been done is that part of the program of honourable members opposite is to try to convince the Australian people that a republic is inevitable. The program is, `We are not bothering about the whys or the wherefores; we are just bothering about the hows'. They say it is going to be inevitable, so that is why we have got the committee on how we are going to do it. As I said, that has put the cart well before the horse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moreton has said to wait until the public debate starts. I can assure the honourable member for Moreton and others on his side that they should wait until the debate starts, because that is when they are going to get a very rude shock. I am very disappointed that the honourable member for Moreton should say that the government is spending millions supporting the constitutional monarchy and the Governor-General. But that system is the taxpayers' own government, that is what we are. That expenditure is not supporting the argument for a constitutional monarchy, but is part of the supporting expenditure for the system of government we have right now. So I say shame on the honourable member for Moreton for advancing that specious argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then he comes up with the absolute dilly that Prince Charles is coming to Australia next year, and that is going to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. We have prominent people coming to this country all the time: did the honourable member complain about all of the money spent by his government to bring Nelson Mandela here? No, he did not. What is the difference? The honourable member is using this specious argument to suggest that because Prince Charles is coming that that is a monarchical thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are already an independent country. We are building closer and closer ties with countries outside the Commonwealth. Our future is in the Asia-Pacific rim and we can pursue that equally well as a constitutional monarchy or as a republic. I do not believe the republic is going to come.

Undoubtedly this will not be the last debate to occur in the House on this issue, but I might be the last speaker today to comment on funding of the Republic Advisory Committee. Certainly there will be further debate about the options and the proposals to move towards a republic as we move closer to 2001.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Republic Advisory Committee was not designed to prepare the basic arguments for an Australian republic but to look at options for implementing a republic. As the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) pointed out, the Australian people will decide whether they want a republic and, if so, the form that it will take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that there is no balance in the funding at this stage is, I think, very flawed. The simple fact is that, after some 90 years of constitutional monarchy here in Australia, without a doubt it is a healthy thing that we do have debate, that we do have consideration of other options. The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) said that the republican debate has only surfaced since 1975. That is completely incorrect. The republican debate has been around since the talk started about implementing federation as such and about a Commonwealth. In other words, from 1880 or even earlier the forms and the nature of government have been under discussion. Obviously, with the compromise settlement which was achieved in the 1890s and the implementation of the present federation, the constitutional monarchists, if you like, won the day. But if we go back to the debates that took place then, we see that they did not win it very handsomely. They did win the debate on the day and carry the numbers, and I guess that might be what it is all about. But it is more than that, it is about implementing a constitution; about a system of government which is real and recognised not just by the rest of the world but certainly by the Australian population. The debate and the options which are available for Australia in the 21st century are what we should be looking at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In funding the Republic Advisory Committee, the government is not funding the debate but simply looking at the options, as I mentioned. The pro-monarchy organisations can put forward options, either to keep things the same or to change things around, so that the constitutional monarchy that they might propose does reflect the needs and the wishes of Australian society as we leave the 20th century and move into the 21st century. To say that we should not tinker with or even change certain aspects of our constitution belies what a constitution is all about. If they want to run that argument, let us run out the old Magna Carta and we will stick with that and we will not go to any further amendments or changes or constitutions, whether we are talking about a constitution such as the United States has or Australia has or any other country has. It is up to the people of Australia to adopt and maintain a constitution. If they want to reject a particular one, they are quite free to do so. They can do it through a democratic process or they can do it as Colonel Rabuka in Fiji chose to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some comments made about government funding to other organisations when honourable members on the other side took some exception to the comments of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) with regard to the funding which goes towards trips and what a visit by somebody like Prince Charles would actually mean to Australia. Without doubt, the presence of Prince Charles will be used very strongly by Australians for Constitutional Monarchy. That is their prerogative. President Bush, the head of a republic, was here as head of a state which just happens to be a republic. He certainly was not, as far as I can see or anyone else would argue, actually pushing the pro-republican debate into the Australian society. Neither was Nelson Mandela, but he was certainly extended due courtesy as the distinguished world person that he is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In today's grievance debate I want to draw this House's attention to the plight of the seniors community and most particularly to the problems these people have in regard to their investments. But, first of all, I want to grieve about the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the serious trouble she is in about the allocation of sporting funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year I helped one organisation in my own electorate with its application and, lo and behold, when the application was granted, the letter of announcement came from the Labor candidate for my seat. I wonder whether the minister can explain how that was not a blatant abuse of the sporting facilities program. More of this matter on another day. It is my fervent hope that the government will take heed of the concerns I raise today, for the problems of Australia's aged communities are very real and have been totally overlooked and ignored by this Keating Labor government and its ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear from the outset that I am responding to the level of concern that pensioners and retired people have raised with me over the past months. I rise here today to voice the concerns and views of those people whom I represent. As some honourable members may be aware, the electorate of Cook has Labor electorates as its neighbours. Indeed, one could drive for some miles before reaching another coalition electorate. However, I warn the government and the House that this situation will definitely change at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that many people from outside my electorate have found it necessary to contact me in regard to the problems they are experiencing, because they have simply come up against a brick wall when they have contacted their own local member, with one notable exception. There can be no clearer example of this than the issue of pensioners' shares. The government's handling of this issue was nothing short of a disgrace. Let there be no mistake about that. This Labor government was intent on reducing pensions for elderly people just because those seniors had invested in shares. Pensioners who had managed to save a bit of money for their retirement or who had decided to take early retirement with special redundancy payments&mdash;and there are many of them&mdash;and then decided to invest that money in Australian companies by buying shares were an easy target for this government. Let us not forget that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor government thought it was a good idea to rob pensioners of their main source of income. Only the sensible opposition to this move from the coalition and others prevented many pensioners from being caught in this net. Unfortunately, those pensioners who purchased shares after August 1992 are still subject to this iniquitous legislation which the coalition continues to oppose. So it is not surprising that my office was inundated with calls and letters from seniors regarding this particular issue. Pensioners who had received no assistance from their local Labor member were forced to contact my office to protest about the government's decision. Members of the government should hang their heads in shame, but I think we all know that they will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad state of affairs when the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) refuses to go on talkback radio to explain the government's legislation and to receive calls from pensioners. However, this should come as no surprise as the minister would not even face the parliament over the issue. He simply handed the baton to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) and washed his hands of the plight of pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The behaviour of the Minister for Social Security is characteristic of the government's attitude to the seniors community in Australia. This government has abandoned the concerns of elderly people, particularly those who have some form of investment. The seniors community is angry and frustrated that this government expects it to cope with enough changes to legislation to confuse most people in the accounting profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensioners are left waiting on the telephone for long periods, trying to get some explanation from the authorities for a reduction in, or indeed cancellation of, their pensions. There is no forewarning that their entitlements are to be affected. Pensioners have little recourse except to contact their local member when they feel they have been harshly treated. In Sydney, I can assure honourable members, many members of the government will not talk to their constituents on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combined effect of these circumstances is causing great confusion amongst pensioners and retired people alike. The current issue of pensioners who hold managed investments is also of great concern to many pensioners and urgently needs to be addressed by the government. Presently, it is not uncommon for pensioners to find that their pension has been cancelled or severely reduced because the Department of Social Security has deemed a high rate of return on investments. However, the way in which the department and the fund managers assess the investments differs markedly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since March of this year the capital growth component of managed investments has been counted as income under the pension incomes test, though this bears no relation to the actual return to the pensioner. This is a similar situation to the way the government had shamefully attempted to treat increases in share values. Many pensioners feel rightly aggrieved that their investments are treated in this manner and clearly this is a real and significant problem which needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only the mechanism of the legislation which is wrong; it is the underlying principle behind the government's intention which is manifestly unfair. I find great difficulty in accepting that capital growth can be classed as income when the pensioner is not in receipt of that increase. Many pensioners hold a similar view and also raise the double effect of capital gains tax when the investment is actually realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot have it both ways. It is patently unfair to reduce a pension on the basis that the investment has appreciated and to class that increase as income, and then to tax that increase as a capital gain when the pensioner redeems the investment. That is double taxation, and very many seniors have raised this issue with me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What needs to be remembered in the complete process of assessment of investments for pensioners is that this sector of the community should be afforded dignity. Many pensioner recipients have served in armed forces during several wars, most pensioners have lived through a depression&mdash;and are we not all living through one now?&mdash;most pensioners have contributed much to the development of this country and most pensioners have paid their fair share of taxes in their lifetime. I do not think, therefore, that it is unreasonable to grant them the degree of respect and courtesy which should be afforded them at this stage in their lives. Sadly, the government's legislation has created the opposite effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consider the fact that a 91-year-old gentleman has to contact me, his local member, to get information about the constant changes to the way his small investments are being treated. One really has to wonder about the government's intentions. Sadly, this is what has actually happened in my electorate and is happening every single day. This is not an isolated case and this government has created such a confusing maze of regulations which are constantly changing that many pensioners simply do not know where they stand&mdash;and who can blame them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it is the hallmark of this government to ram through legislation via the guillotine, to stifle democratic debate, then it is no wonder that such a process will lead to general confusion in the seniors community. In all of my dealings with seniors who have investments it is evident that they place high priority on security in their retirement, though at present there is no such certainty. I implore the government, through the Minister for Social Security, to give them urgent consideration, for it is evident that the pensioner community is denied assurance that the rules will not change periodically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has steadfastly argued that the legislation relating to the treatment of shares as income should be totally repealed and that there should be a full-scale inquiry into the assets and incomes test for pensioners. This has been our position for a long time, and it was only when the Labor government was faced with the resolution of the Senate that it proceeded to set up the current inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the report of this committee is not scheduled to be released until September 1994. It is imperative that this committee conducts thorough investigations into the problem of pensioner investments. Along with many pensioners in the community, I look forward to reading the findings of that review process. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is now widely accepted that our national prospects for economic growth and job creation are largely dependent on increasing our level of trade with Asia. Our chances of success will depend heavily on becoming more enmeshed with the region across a wide range of cultural and community activities. Our aim should be to increase mutual understanding and interchange with Asia. In particular, proficiency in Asian languages and knowledge of Asian cultures are the key to increasing mutual understanding as well as to creating the jobs of the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether we are talking about tourism or building exports in specialist Asian markets for our small manufacturing enterprises, knowledge of foreign languages is every bit as critical as proficiency in maths and English. For example, by the year 2000, 40 per cent of our jobs generated by international tourism will come from east Asian tourism. In that year, according to projections from the National Centre for Studies in Tourism, 571,000 Australians will be employed in domestic and international tourism. We can project that of those, 260,000 will flow from international tourism directly and of those 260,000, 103,000 jobs will come directly from east Asian tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the year 2010, based on the centre's projections, 895,000 Australians will be employed in tourism, and 203,000 jobs will come directly from east Asian tourism. In this context the recent recommendations of the caucus task force should be widely discussed and debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations of the caucus employment task force were, firstly, that all arms of government should be required to develop programs for engagement with Asia and, secondly, that Australia should attach the highest priority to the adoption and implementation of a long-term strategy to ensure that the Australian work force of the future is equipped with language skills and associated skills of cultural awareness of direct relevance to our national economic interest. This will mean targeting the principal languages of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether we are talking about jobs created in tourism or jobs created in manufacturing industry, which is getting exports into Asia, proficiency in languages is about employment across a wide range of occupations including the professions. Unfortunately, some in our community see foreign language education as being all too frequently necessary to allow Australians to `serve the drinks' rather than creating a range of jobs in management, accounting, computing, metalwork and communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that proficiency in languages will create jobs and occupations other than service occupations. Creating jobs in the tourist industry or selling computer equipment to Asia is not like selling iron ore to Japan or wheat to China. Things have changed dramatically. If we are going to create jobs in the tourist industry or in manufacturing exports it also requires a sophisticated cultural understanding because selling computers and running tourist resorts means that our work force has to have a sophisticated understanding of people-to-people contact. It is not like it was many years ago when we were selling those bulk commodities. At that time we did not require that sophisticated understanding of people to people contact, and to have that understanding we do require proficiency in foreign languages. But we not only require proficiency in foreign languages; we also require an understanding of cultures, particularly Asian cultures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason a comprehensive national language program in the early years of schooling is absolutely essential to our success as a sophisticated trading nation in Asia. I am pleased to report that in Queensland such a program is taking place. It is important that that program be extended nationally and that our national government takes up the challenge of bringing forth a national language program in the early years of schooling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accessing the markets of east Asia presents significant challenges for our Australian exporters. There are linguistic and cultural barriers facing Australian firms exporting to and investing in Asia. They are significant. There is a growing body of expert opinion which suggests that English is not the language of business in north Asia and South-East Asia. The economies of the region are becoming increasingly interdependent, generating their own sources of economic growth and correspondingly less dependent on trade outside the region. In these circumstances it is the languages of the region which are becoming the primary means of communication for business. As Dr Stephen FitzGerald has recently noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the overseas Chinese, the world of finance and commerce within the Asian region is driven by the Chinese, in total about 1.2 billion people.</PARA>
<PARA>An inability by Australian exporters to Asia to conduct businesses in languages and understand the societies of the region will be a significant constraint on doing business in these markets. As Ross Garnaut has argued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's long-term success in getting the most out of its relationship with Asia depends more than anything else on the scale and quality of its investment in education.</PARA>
<PARA>The scale and quality of our investment in education means a large and continuing investment in foreign language education. To this end, Garnaut has recommended that a substantial number of Australians should achieve mastery of priority Asian languages, economics, politics and other attributes of their cultures. An understanding of the languages and operations of Asian societies will be essential if Australian businesses are to compete on an even or better footing than their competitors in the region. Overcoming many of these non-tariff barriers that exist in Asia is particularly important to the export of elaborately transformed manufactures and services and will require an understanding of Asian languages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the nature of the products, the successful marketing of elaborately transformed manufactures requires greater awareness of the operations of the market being targeted than is the case, as I said before, for the export of primary products such as wheat or iron ore. Similarly, trade in services is highly people to people intensive requiring in-depth knowledge of the language and the society of the customer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent McKinsey report for the Australian Manufacturing Council entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Emerging exporters</EMPHASIS> provides a number of recommendations to enhance the competitive advantage of Australian industries. One of those recommendations is the need to improve market information and representation to facilitate local networking and joint ventures between local manufacturers and potential overseas partners. For east Asian markets, linguistic skills and cultural knowledge will be absolutely essential if Australian exporters are to obtain the required level of market information and penetration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background, it is critical that the Australian government attach the highest priority to the adoption and implementation of a long-term strategy to ensure that the Australian work force of the future is equipped with language skills, and associated skills of cultural awareness, of direct relevance to our national economic interests. Specifically, this will mean targeting the principal languages of east Asia. </PARA>

Our future is not with the machinations of this place but rather in the sandpits and on the swings in playgrounds around Australia as I speak.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will always be looking after the welfare of my children.</PARA>
<PARA>It was a fatherly declaration that many in the community would agree with and the general agreement within the community is that we should accept that responsibility and challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of child care is an important one and is of ongoing concern to many families living in the electorate of Cowan. It is growing in importance for two reasons. Firstly, with more parents entering the work force, as they have to these days, it becomes crucial that they are not confronted with barriers in providing adequate child care. Secondly, as more families choose to use child-care facilities, greater emphasis is being placed on the provision for sound and appropriate care which will enhance the children's development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, in Cowan there are some 12,000 children and one in 10 of the population is under five years of age. I must say that I share the concerns of these children's parents about adequate and proper child care, for my own children Anthony and Kaitlyn are aged under five. So this concern can be with anybody and everybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cowan is named after Dame Edith Cowan, the first woman to enter any Australian parliament. She was renown for her efforts to ensure social justice and coincidentally fought for the establishment of day nurseries. How ironic that, some 60 years later, we are still to address this issue adequately, as I would like to address some of the problems experienced by child-care providers in Cowan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My work in the child-care area has been supported by  Lynette Kooperman of the Moolanda child-care centre and Tracey Pearse of the Girrawheen child-care centre. Both of these professionals are coping with the important role they play within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, both clearly agree without hesitation that an immediate review of the provision for funding in this very important area is required. The most dramatic effect that the issue of funding has on child care is the unacceptably large waiting lists which presently exist within many centres within Cowan, as I am sure they do in other electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other issues of importance surrounding child-care centres are the national accreditation system, the need to provide for children with special needs, and the need to extend the sales tax exemption to four-year-old family centres in Western Australia. To highlight the need to rethink the government's current policy on child care, I draw on the experiences of the two child-care centres I have previously identified. The Moolanda Community Centre in Kingsley is a community based child-care centre built in 1986 to provide care for 45 children. Recently it was given approval to increase the number of child-care positions to 48. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the centre being purpose-built, it is unable to cope with the ever-increasing demand from the community within the local area. It is funded by the Commonwealth and with some income coming from the parents. The Moolanda child-care centre, which is only seven years old, is now experiencing huge demand and, although it has closed registrations for 1994, it has a waiting list of over 60 children. The paradox of this problem is that a new child-care centre which is due to open in a few weeks was built some two blocks away to relieve the demand, but already it has a waiting list for 1994 of 40. The big problem, of course, does not end there, because I am advised that this centre receives 10 to 15 inquiries every week for child-care places: an enormous figure, and one which must be of concern to all within the child-care industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Lynette Kooperman was asked how she would describe the current waiting list, she said enormous. I would think enormous would be an understatement. Perhaps troubling would be a better description&mdash;or, even better, disastrous&mdash;for the people of Kingsley wanting child care for next year. It is an absolute tragedy for parents of children within this district to be worried about their future because of the inadequate provision of child-care facilities. When we review the operation of the Girrawheen centre, in a lower socioeconomic area than Kingsley, we begin to see more clearly the enormity of the child-care problem within Cowan. This centre provides child-care facilities for families in one of Perth's most financially and socially depressed areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are the families of Cowan asked to bear the brunt of the current high employment rates, which are as high as one in 10, but the families of Girrawheen are exposed to more crime, have higher rates of family breakdown, and now face the dilemma of shortage of child-care facilities. The Girrawheen centre is sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy and is presently licensed to carry 61 children per day. It has recently received Lotteries Commission funding to care for young babies. At times, they have waiting lists of up to 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dilemma the centre is faced with is the ever-increasing demand for places for two-year-olds, a demand which will crowd out the system in future years. The staff advised me that not only are they under pressure to supply the increasing child-care needs of the community, but they are also asked to address the special needs of families. This centre has an increasing demand for respite care for families who are finding the current economic climate difficult to cope with when coupled with normal family duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested to me that when staff are confronted with stressed parents wanting respite from their parental responsibilities, for whatever reason, then child-care providers find it difficult and unprofessional to refuse, and thus they accommodate the request. This places enormous strains, as one could imagine, on resources. Working and studying parents are given priority when it comes to child care and, although this may appear reasonable on the surface, it does not address the needs of the stressed parents within the community. In high risk child abuse areas, where unemployment and the associated stresses are magnified, the children of parents in desperate need are placed on a third or fourth priority for child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issues needs addressing urgently. We cannot continue as a successful community to place our children&mdash;our future&mdash;at ongoing risk of neglect through inadequate child-care facilities. Clearly, the demands for child care require urgent attention and action, with the need to address the changing demands of communities, which may change from virtually one year to the next. The excellent work being provided by our child-carers within the 32 centres within Cowan should not be treated without the respect the industry deserves. We should place a higher priority on the need to continually review the system of child care. The work of Tracey Pearse and Lynette Kooperman should not be undermined by the lack of concern for the pressures they presently face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record of child care under this government continues to challenge the myths associated with the Labor Party. We are beginning to see that the myths about this party are nowhere near the reality. Under Labor, child-care fees have doubled over the last eight years. The government has failed to ensure that adequate child-care facilities are evenly distributed over the community to allow all Australians equal access to child care. The government insists on the paradox that child care should be subsidised for those that can readily afford it. The government continues to ignore children who are cared for at home. Child care is an issue that should be the concern of all Australians who care about the future and, therefore, our nation's children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has shown through its policies over the years that child care is a high priority as it is at the base of the family unit. The coalition policy includes: a commitment to increase the availability of child-care places; a commitment to generous fee relief for those families that are in greatest need; a commitment to increasing funding for the care of children with disabilities or with special needs; a commitment to a voluntary national child-care accreditation system, a system that allows parents to choose the child care that will best suit their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;as he suggested the other day&mdash;I love my children, as I am sure every parent does. I will continue to work to ensure that their welfare is secure but I will go further by stating the commitment I am prepared to make. Without fear of reprisal, I pledge to the parents of the electorate of Cowan, who also wish to ensure the welfare of their children, that I will take steps in this place and within the electorate to improve the standard of child care by raising the need to increase child-care places and to support those within the industry in Cowan by bringing their concerns to the parliament of Australia. I say to all Cowan residents: our children need us; let us not repay their faith in us by losing our way for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recently held discussions with a business person in Geelong to receive an update on the progress of commercialisation of an innovative product that he had developed. It is one that I mentioned in my maiden speech: an oil immersed disc braking system which has been developed by a small Geelong firm called Gearing Dynamics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gentleman recounted a recent trip he had undertaken to Melbourne along the Princes Highway and observations he had made about the visible histories of unstable braking events that adorned that particular stretch of highway. The observation he made about these tyre skid histories on the road concerned the high proportion of what he called `single event happenings', that is, where the front wheel of the vehicle had locked and the car was caused to swerve and the stopping distance greatly extended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly interested in his comments, as I have a 16-year-old daughter who recently expressed an interest in saving to purchase a motorbike as her preferred means of transport. I was keenly interested in the safety issues that would be canvassed by the situation that this gentleman had described. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He made a very perceptive statement and posed a very interesting question. In the last 40 years we have seen a staggering increase in the service life of engines and transmissions in motor vehicles, so why has there not been a corresponding improvement in the service life of the braking equipment, given that brakes represent, arguably, the most important safety device on a motor vehicle?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One important consequence of the improved performance of engines and transmissions is that, not only are motor vehicles used more often, they are less likely to be in the hands of skilled motor mechanics who would be likely to detect braking system wear and impairment. On reflection, one can only conclude that all motor vehicle drive train components, including the braking system, ought to have a whole of life service expectancy. In addition, they should not be the pollutive systems that they currently are. It is this latter aspect, the pollutive nature of current braking systems and technology, that I would like to comment on in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members would know, an important brake pad composite used in the past and indeed today is asbestos. It has been and is used primarily because it is cheaper than other composite materials. There are three types of asbestos. In layman's terms, they are white, blue and brown. Asbestos is widely known as a carcinogen and it was widely accepted in medical circles that blue asbestos caused mesothelioma, a fatal cancer of the chest or the abdominal wall. However, a study in recent years by the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety has documented for the first time white asbestos as a cause of mesothelioma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">White asbestos is used as an important brake pad composite material and up to 10,000 tonnes are used each year in Australian industry, including the braking industry. The automotive industry has accepted the need to phase out the use of asbestos as a brake pad composite. Non-asbestos pads are now fitted to the current output of the industry. But there are still thousands upon thousands of vehicles on our roads today, especially in our cities, spewing into the air a fine, black dust residue containing asbestos fibre, which is being ingested by many Australians in urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is worse is that there are many newer cars, originally fitted with non-asbestos pads, that, when put in for the fitment of replacement brake pads, are being fitted with cheap asbestos pad imports. The sad and disturbing fact about the situation is that currently there are no controls over products used in the brake replacement and fitment industry. Consequently, there has been a flood of cheap asbestos pad imports to this country from Malaysia, India and Spain. Not only does it threaten the livelihoods of those currently employed in Australia in the production of non-asbestos pads&mdash;the environmentally friendly pads, I guess you could say, in a relative sense at least&mdash;but this situation poses a long-term health hazard to Australians generally. While the major car manufacturers have been phasing out the use of asbestos pads in line with European and American conventions, the whole process appears to be undermined by the extensive use of asbestos pad imports in the brake replacement industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several possible solutions to the problem we face in the use of asbestos in braking systems. The government can regulate its use in the industry by banning it completely, it can ban the importation of cheap asbestos based replacement products for use in the braking industry, or it can tax the substance out of use, as it intends to do with lead in petrol. The other alternative, I guess, is to let the market decide by exerting its preference for a braking technology that effectively addresses the service life issue, the safety issue and the pollution issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that that technology exists, and it has been developed in Geelong in my electorate by a very small innovative firm. The eternal argument about the use of asbestos or even non-asbestos materials as brake composites is now simply dated with the development of a new braking technology by this small Geelong firm. The totally sealed, oil immersed braking system, called SROID, that has been developed is not only pollution free but under test conditions displays inherently better stability and balance characteristics than existing conventional systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question now is not really whether improved braking systems such as SROID ought to be universally adopted. The real question is how long we as a community are going to be prepared to tolerate the continued use of carcinogenic materials in a dated technology which poses a serious health risk to Australians living in urban areas. The development of this new automotive technology demonstrates once again that we are indeed an inventive and clever society in one sense, but the way we permit the continued use of materials that have great potential to cause public health harm and risk betrays what I would term a splendid stupidity in another sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The moves against the use of asbestos are fairly well developed in the United States. In the United Kingdom we see the great insurance company, Lloyds of London, reeling under actions that have been brought regarding the use of asbestos related products. I wonder how long it is going to take Australians to come to a similar conclusion about how dangerous this substance is. I wonder how long it is going to be before the environmental movement in this country pays some real attention to this new revolutionary technology, which not only has an application in the mining industry and in industry generally but has automotive applications as well. I wonder how long it is going to be before governments look seriously at the public health risks that are caused by the use of what are now outdated braking technologies. I hope that it will not be too long. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are very few opportunities for private members to express their views on matters of concern and I am pleased that we have the grievance debate in the parliament for this purpose. Today I wish to refer to an issue that I have been worried about for a very long time and that is violence, particularly in the video, television and film industries. The debate in this area is a never ending story. On the one hand, there are people who say that in any civilised society people should be able to read and see what they want. On the other hand, it is certainly not too much to ask for reasonable standards that do not undermine what is taught by families and schools; standards that do not peddle physical and sexual violence to our impressionable young people and others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a simple fact of life that violence pours into homes across our nation. The mass media and entertainment industries see to that. My office, over the eight months since the last election, has been inundated with complaints about violence and pornography. Concerned constituents ring up constantly, and many of these complaints refer to television violence and to news services. Some of the horrible events in places such as Bosnia-Herzegovina and Somalia are shown in graphic detail across our television screens at early time slots when children could be watching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Complaints also refer to videos and violence. In recent times we have actually had some people contact us expressing concerns about some violent computer programs. I am certain that honourable members on both sides of the House would have experienced similar complaints from people across our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the head of the Australian Council for Children's Film and Television, Barbara Biggins, made comment on the impact that acts of violence portrayed on television have on the behaviour of some young children. As we all know, television, films and videos are powerful teachers, particularly for young children aged up to 11. United States research has found that media violence should be regarded as a public health problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Giving evidence to the federal parliamentary inquiry into violence in schools, the Children's Film Council president urged the inquiry to consider the role of mass media violence and its contribution to violence in schools, and urged government, media and broadcasters to unite in their responsibility to ensure healthy viewing for Australia's youth. I certainly support this aim and I would like to place that on record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We open our newspapers and we read about serial killers. Unfortunately, many people have got the ideas for what they do from film violence, television violence and video violence. Our society, like other societies throughout the world, is a complex structure and it is difficult to study any single institution or social process in isolation. However, research has often shown a direct correlation between media violence and gross antisocial acts. This has been looked at from time to time but, to my knowledge, no satisfactory solution has yet been implemented. Serial killer Ted Bundy warned before his execution that the media had played a role in the development of his sociopathic behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treating the media and entertainment industry as scapegoats, as the causes of never-ending social troubles, will get us nowhere. Violence has always existed; however, it has not always been beamed into homes across the nation. It has not always been beamed into the lounge rooms of Australia. It has not always been flaunted before the eyes of young children. Something has to be done about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that, sadly, more violence is now portrayed in videos, films and computer programs. Some social engineers say that this reflects the current nature of our society. That is an incorrect statement. People across the social and political spectrums share my concern in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Purveyors of violence surely have a responsibility to the Australian public. Governments have a responsibility to the Australian public, as does the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The Film Censorship Board should also not be exempt from scrutiny. It is a cop-out to say that in a democracy we should be able to read and see what we want. Even if one held that view, what about our young people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can we protect our society? As I said earlier, I am inundated with phone calls from constituents complaining about the present situation in television, video and films. Violence and pornography are a major public concern. Frightening scenes for young children, such as those in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jurassic Park</EMPHASIS>, have become the norm, and violence has become an everyday event. People cannot turn on their television without seeing violence. It is not easy to go to the video shop and hire a suitable video for children and we have to be very careful when buying computer programs if violence is to be avoided. Violence has been interwoven into every aspect of the media and entertainment industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The popularity of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</EMPHASIS> brought with it street fighting, increasing the incidence of schoolyard altercations. Standards continue to plummet. Violent TV programs are unfortunately advertised in early timeslots. Violent cartoons, where the main character or hero is the star thug, have raised concerns among parents. As everyone knows and accepts, these are major adverse influences on our children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be argued that parents are primarily responsible for censorship in their own home. This is so, but it is becoming more and more difficult for parents to see what their children choose to watch. How do we balance parental and broadcasting responsibility? Modern technologies such as pay TV will make the position even more difficult for parents who are very careful about what their children see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More and more families under Labor's recession have been forced into a situation where both parents have to go to work full time. It follows that latchkey children, old enough to care for themselves each afternoon after school, spend much of their time as couch potatoes in front of television or watching a video or playing a computer. It is a fact of life. It happens right across Australia. It is very difficult for parents, even those who are particularly concerned about their children's future, to monitor just what their children are doing at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wider Australian public is increasingly worried about violence. An Australian Broadcasting Tribunal report to the minister in 1990 formulated 13 recommendations. It found that violence occurred across a wide range of programs shown in Australia, including news and current affairs, cartoons, advertisements and fictional drama. The main thrust of the recommendations was to improve the public's knowledge of industry rules and regulations and to develop an industry-wide self-regulatory code on the presentation of violence. These codes certainly have their place in society but, in an industry which survives on ratings, is self-regulation an appropriate protection?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly confusion in the community about this. There is certainly confusion in the Fisher electorate regarding this issue of classifications for television and video. Many people still cannot understand&mdash;and I must say that I am one of them&mdash;why a violent film such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Silence of the Lambs</EMPHASIS>, a film which shows cannibalism, received only an M rating. Violence has become a feature of television and video and is a problem deserving serious consideration. Violent computer programs must also be looked at very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present situation is clearly unsatisfactory and must be addressed. It is totally unacceptable for the community to be subjected to violence on TV, videos and in computer programs. It is not good enough for people to be able to say that citizens should be able to see what they want because any civilised society must have standards which reflect its community values. As the father of two young children I share the concerns of my constituents and I think that we, in a non-partisan way, should be able to look at this major problem. I ask the government to reconsider this major problem confronting our nation. Society demands it and let us hope that something happens sooner rather than later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over recent days honourable members may have read something of the piracy activity that is occurring to the north of Australia. They may have read of the vessel <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Erria Inge</EMPHASIS> which was taken illegally from Bombay in March 1991. It was allegedly pirated by two Singapore businessmen. I would like to commend the journalist who wrote all the material, Matthew Russell of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. I think we are going to hear a lot more about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention that only because it points to a major problem to the north of Australia that has been developing over recent years and that constitutes my grievance today. That grievance is the growing prevalence of piracy on the high seas and the failure of government to suppress its development. Most people think of the skull and crossbones when piracy on the high seas is mentioned. However, piracy in modern terms is the holding up of ships, the boarding of ships, the throwing aboard of Molotov cocktails to slow the vessel down, the use of fast boats that are low in the water and difficult to detect by radar, the holding up of the crew, the robbing of the safe, the injuring of the crew, and in some cases the murder of the crew members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most important thing arising out of this, after injury and loss of life of crew members, is the danger to safe navigation of the ships concerned. What we are seeing today are modern bandits at sea. Of major importance is that danger being created for safe navigation. The nature and the seriousness of the attacks have grown over recent years. Back in the 1980s when we heard of piracy at sea to the north of us&mdash;it is mainly in Asian waters that I am referring to&mdash;the ships were attacked by assailants carrying knives or swords, not explosive weapons. In some cases they were even unarmed and what they were about was petty theft or getting cash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in 1991 the use of hand guns began to become common, as did violence against crew members. By August 1991 the chief officer of a ship was shot and killed just eight kilometres out of Singapore Harbour. In April 1992 an oil tanker was attacked four hours out of Singapore, the one I referred to a moment ago. It was attacked by people from three fast boats. They threw molotov cocktails on board the vessel to slow it down. When the ship slowed down they forced the crew on deck and forced them out while they were fighting the fires on board. Subsequently  a child and two crew members were injured in the confrontation. In December 1992 the master and chief officer of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Boltimar Zephyr</EMPHASIS> were killed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The instances of attacks in the Malacca Straits, the straits between Indonesia and Malaysia and down to the Singapore Straits, whilst they have subsided over recent months, were of growing prevalence and were of growing concern. But the actions of the Indonesian and Malaysian governments have resulted in some 40 persons being arrested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case we ask, `Who are these people?'. The major information that comes to me&mdash;obviously from sources I cannot disclose&mdash;is that the behaviour of these people on board ships indicates that they are well trained, well disciplined people who know how ships are operated and know how to handle weapons. Most people thought they were off-duty defence personnel. I am told that some 40 of those people were shot and that the level of incidents has considerably subsided over recent months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The action is moving more to the South China Sea now, into the Philippine Sea. So far this year 25 Russian ships have been attacked in the South China Sea. Quite a number of those vessels have been attacked in Chinese waters, and again there is an indication that the vessels concerned could be vessels operating out of Chinese waters. We do not know what origin; they are well equipped vessels that are carrying out the attacks. But there is a grave danger in all of this to safe ship operation. A vessel can be out of control while it is under attack; there can be nobody on the bridge. There is the case of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nagasaki Spirit</EMPHASIS> in the Malacca Straits in 1992 that was rammed by a container vessel. The tanker was full of fuel, it burst into flames and the crews of both vessels were incinerated. There is nobody left to explain what happened, but it is believed that one of the vessels was under pirate attack at the time of the collision. That is a very clear indication of what can happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People may ask, `Why should Australia be concerned about this? What is the interest of this to Australia?'. There is a grave interest for Australia because these activities are taking place across Australia's major trade routes. The fact is that five Australian ships have been attacked by pirates in the past 10 years. It is very hard to get the names of the vessels because there is a reluctance to disclose that a vessel was attacked. That may relate to insurance reasons; it may relate to reliability of service or whatever the reason, but it is difficult to get the names of the vessels. ANL had a piracy report on its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anro Australia</EMPHASIS>, when it was attacked in June 1986 off Singapore by four male pirates. On that occasion, again the lesser kind of activity, the captain awoke to find a knife at his throat at four in the morning, and he was robbed of $2,000 and his personal possessions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The piracy that is taking place is across our major trade routes. The International Maritime Organisation, IMO, has been advised of some 440 acts of piracy and armed robbery over the past 10 years. However, many acts of piracy go unreported, for the reasons I have referred to earlier, so the actual level of attack that is occurring is unknown. The IMO formed a seven-member working party, which included Australia, in January of this year, and obviously the activities of that group were associated with the actions of the Indonesian government and the Malaysian government in curbing the level of piracy attack in the Malaccan Straits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred to the danger to safe navigation and I pointed to what could have happened. There is another cost, the cost of delays of ships that may be the subject of pirate attack. There is the cost of inspection; there is the cost of investigation. An average ship costs something like $25,000 a day to run. So there is a cost to transport. There is also the interruption to transport schedules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People might ask, `Who should protect them?'. On the high seas no country has jurisdiction, but the ship should be able to look to its flag state. So under law the responsibility would be with the country in which that ship is registered. It is interesting that a number of these attacks are occurring with the vessels registered in the flag of convenience countries, because obviously the bandits sorted out that they are not likely to have the resources to be sending their navies to the high seas to protect ships wearing their flags. So that again makes the acts of piracy much easier. It is clear that there is an interconnection with highly organised criminal activity. There is evidence of selective opening of containers or holds with high value cargoes, implying prior knowledge of the cargo manifest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is evidence that they know what the ship schedules are and when the ships are moving. The attackers have demonstrated knowledge of the ship's procedures, seeking to board when the bridge and engine room personnel are fully engaged in navigating through congested or restricted waters. The smaller crew numbers on ships have made it easier for pirates to attack ships. So, if we look to what can be done about this and who should be doing something about it, I said that the nation responsible should assist its ship: if it is wearing an Australian flag, it is the Australian government; if it is a Honduras flag, it is the Honduran government. What we could be doing is trying to better schedule our naval activities in those areas of pirate activity where Australian ships are likely to be endangered, and doing that in collaboration with the other nations in the area. That way we can get a better result to try and stem this disruption, the dangers, the loss of life that is being caused and the risk to safe navigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would like to see the Australian government, in response to my grievance today, taking more action in association with our neighbours to the north in coordinating the activities of the naval services to try to better protect Australian ships. In the process of doing that, the other nations that are involved will be protecting ships of other flags. In that way we can try to stem the growth in this horrendous activity, put an end to the loss of life and ensure that we have safe navigation and no more repetitions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nagasaki Spirit</EMPHASIS> disaster. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I grieve this afternoon at the way in which the High Court is moving to extend its powers and influence and to usurp the law-making functions of this parliament. Over recent years the High Court has made a number of decisions which have significantly altered the balance of power in our federation and changed the fundamental fabric of our society. The High Court has wrought change which would never have been approved by this parliament or by the Australian people in referendum. It is time that the parliament and the people re-asserted their right to make the laws of Australia and rejected any handover or subjugation of this responsibility to the High Court or international treaties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court was established under chapter 3 of the Australian constitution. Its powers, responsibilities and functions are prescribed in 10 of the 128 clauses of our constitution. Those powers do not include any right to make laws. Clause 51 of the constitution clearly `vests the powers to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth' in the parliament. Subsequent clauses detail how laws are made and they do not refer to the High Court at all. Indeed, parliament is given power to prescribe much of the detail of the way in which the High Court functions, not the opposite. The High Court is therefore threatening the democratic balances and processes of government in Australia when it pursues an activist role in public policy areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians are concerned that the High Court now seems to regard itself as having the right to extend or perhaps even change the meaning and intent of the constitution rather than just interpret what the people have put in place. The Franklin dam decision permanently altered the balance of powers between the federal and state governments in a manner that was clearly not in keeping with the intentions of the founding fathers. In the Mabo decision the High Court invented a new form of land title and gave recognition to an alternative system of law for some Australians. In the election electronic advertising case the court decided that the constitution implied a right of freedom of speech, even though it makes no reference to the subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In each of these instances the High Court could have decided the matter using existing law and precedents. However, with its pioneering attitude, the court seems to be searching for an excuse to invent new law. These decisions have not been based on a judgment of constitutional provisions but have been strongly influenced by the judges' assessment of what they think social policy should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The written Mabo judgments include outrageously emotive statements which, at best, must be regarded as personal opinions and which many qualified observers would see as objectionable. Two of the judges, Sir William Deane and Justice Mary Gaudron, acknowledged that they had been assisted in their judgments by:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">...the researches of the many scholars who have written in the areas into which this judgement has necessarily ventured.</PARA>
<PARA>So, in reaching a decision which has fundamentally changed the future of land management in Australia, the judges selectively accepted the work of some unnamed scholars, even though their work was not subject to scrutiny or cross-examination during the hearing process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No less a figure than the former Queensland Chief Justice and State Governor, Sir Walter Campbell, raised concerns on this issue recently when he suggested that the court had reached its conclusions in the Mabo decision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . through want of care because of the absence of representation and argument by all interested parties and also because of the lack of evidence as to the facts of the Australian mainland occupants.</PARA>
<PARA>In the same vein, Sir Walter places the blame on the High Court for the increased power of the Canberra government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has become clear that the drift to centralism of earlier years has now become quite a flood . . . potentially the Commonwealth can invade any field of governmental activity, and it has invaded many, producing a cumbersome and expensive duplication of bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA>The former Chief Justice, Sir Harry Gibbs, said recently, `The High Court's often controversial interpretation of the constitution had left the states with no legal autonomy to defeat Commonwealth legislation or raise the money to exercise their own powers'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps even more alarming were the comments of one of the High Court judges in a public address following the election electronic advertising decision, when he suggested that the High Court could give the Australian people a bill of rights, even though this concept had been rejected by the Australian people. Is it any wonder that many Australians are concerned about the balance of our democratic system when one of our High Court judges apparently holds the view that not only does the High Court have the right to make new laws, but also it can introduce laws that the people and the parliament have clearly demonstrated that they do not want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court cannot be placed above the democratic process. We cannot have a new group of unaccountable, unelected law makers in our country. Judges are qualified in the law. Indeed, High Court judges should be the best qualified people in the law and those best able to interpret the intent and meaning of the constitution and laws of the land. However, they have no special skills in assessing public opinion and social policy, and so they are ill equipped to make judgments based on such issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, High Court judges are not even typically representative of the population. By law they must have been solicitors or barristers and a judge of another court before being eligible to be appointed to the High Court. They enjoy incomes well above the national average, work in grand offices, fly first class between the various capital cities, meet and talk mainly with other lawyers and professionals and enjoy a lifestyle in keeping with their status. They have, therefore, no special understanding of the views, attitudes and aspirations of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quality of their work is subject to little critical assessment. They are appointed until they turn 70 and can only be dismissed in the most extraordinary of circumstances. If the people are unhappy with their judgments, they cannot be voted out at the next election. There is no practical opportunity for the people to say, `No, you have got it wrong'. The parliament and the taxpayers are left to pick up the pieces after their latest whim. </PARA>

To go to the court again would be a classic case of appealing Caesar to Caesar.

There clearly needs to be some review process for judge-made law. If the Australian High Court adopts the American tendencies of making judgments which take into account their assessments of what public opinion may be on a particular issue, it will expose the court to increasing political scrutiny and public criticism. I have no doubt that the Labor government is seeking to use the High Court to introduce social and constitutional change in Australia which it knows would never be approved by the Australian people in referendum and which it does not have the courage to put before the parliament. </PARA>

If matters other than the law are to be paramount in High Court decisions, the parliament and the public have a right to demand a much more critical scrutiny of the political and social views of potential High Court appointees. Instead, it would be far better to restore the balance of powers as intended in our constitution, with the parliament making the laws and the judiciary assessing disputes. </PARA>

Sadly, he gave his justification for increased judicial law-making as being an assessment that the parliament was incapable of effectively dealing with the issues of the day. It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives has become a farce, with the government using the guillotine and the might of numbers to deny any proper opportunity to develop and scrutinise appropriate laws for the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an appalling indictment of the government that the High Court regards the parliament as such an irrelevance that it feels it has to step in and exercise our legitimate functions.

However, I am prepared to respond to the honourable member's question. I was not sure, when the question was asked, whether the honourable member was referring to a register of claims or the registrar of the tribunal or court. On the assumption that he is talking about a registrar, he then goes on to ask the question whether or not the system to be established by the Commonwealth will contain the usual elements associated with the judicial process. Of course, subject to the particular provisions in the Commonwealth legislation, it will. But it is intended to be a tribunal process established to ensure the greatest degree of informality and the greatest emphasis on consultation and negotiation between the parties.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of the High Court's decision on Mabo is recognition of native title. This recognition is the basis of the government's response on Mabo. The coalition claims to recognise native title and the High Court's decision, but will allow a bill in Western Australia which extinguishes native title. Which is it? Does the coalition support native title, or is the coalition essentially about extinguishment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition says that it recognises native title and wants the Racial Discrimination Act adhered to. The Racial Discrimination Act is law in this country. It is not up to the Liberals or the Nationals to decide whether it be adhered to or not. Those who claim the coalition's position on Mabo is a win for the moderates clearly did not hear the honourable member for Barker on ABC radio this morning. He clearly stated that the High Court's decision might have to be reversed and this was the effect of Richard Court's legislation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we're certainly not saying that at some stage or other that this decision may not, in the end, have to be reversed if it doesn't work.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will recall that the honourable member for Barker said he would resign if he did not get his way on Mabo, but of course he is still there. He wants the High Court's decision reversed and he says the coalition policy does not rule that out. He says that the Western Australian bill, to which the coalition has now given effective support, does reverse that decision. So there is no real, practical recognition of native title. There is no policy to implement the recognition of native title.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I wish to thank the Leader of the National Party of Australia for his question because it allows me to put a number of matters on the public record. I am in debt to the Leader of the National Party for showing such an avid interest in my public pronouncements, in response, I might add, almost on every occasion, to the Leader of the National Party in Queensland, Mr Borbidge; the Leader of the National Party in New South Wales, Mr Armstrong; and, indeed, his own comments which I think have done a great disservice to the coalition parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the question raised by the Leader of the National Party as it relates to Mr Prescott and to BHP. It is true that there have been some public comments made overnight which are critical of the government's proposals. The government believes that when those proposals are understood in detail by the mining industry it will understand that there is no right of veto conferred on Aboriginal people and that the whole intention of the Commonwealth legislation is to put in place a regime of certainty that will benefit not only Aboriginal people but also the mining industry itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answering the question of the Leader of the National Party, I would be failing in my responsibility not to highlight to him and to this House what the peak organisation in the rural industry says about the government's proposal. The National Farmers Federation issued a public statement yesterday unanimously supporting the government's proposal. So out of step is the coalition, so out of step are the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party, that the peak organisation of the body that they were once close to, that once had a degree of respect and trust for them, has turned its back on them and endorsed the government's position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has never believed that reaching a just outcome in response to the Mabo decision would be an easy task. There are some people who have not got all they wanted out of the government's outcome. The end result is that we have produced a package of measures that will work, a package of measures that delivers certainty to industry, but more importantly from my portfolio perspective a series of measures that keep faith absolutely with the sacred trust reposed in this parliament by the 1967 referendum to defend the human rights of Aboriginal people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lilley for his question. Westpac and the Melbourne Institute have released two significant pieces of data over the last week. Most recently, we saw yesterday the release of the Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index for September which was reported widely in the press. The index incorporates nine individual components which together have consistently provided a good indication of future trends in the economy.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice the mirth with which the opposition greets this improved information on the performance of the economy. It is a strange thing that the Leader of the Opposition has spoken about practically nothing else than the economy since he became leader, but of course he really only enjoys talking about the economy when he can talk the country down. When the data on the economy improves, when the evidence demonstrates that the economy is on the improve, his interest in the economy wanes. He does not want to talk about the economy because it is on the improve. All he will do is continue his mindless chatter across the table in an attempt apparently to disguise the importance of this information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leading index published yesterday is now 9.6 per cent above its level of just a year ago. Moreover, the strong upward growth evident over the last 12 months is now beginning to be reflected in the coincident index also released by Westpac and the Melbourne Institute. This increased by 0.9 per cent in September to its highest level since March 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This index released yesterday followed a few days ago the release of the Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer confidence index for November. Again this measure has shown an improvement where consumer sentiment is now at its highest level for five years. All this comes on top of the mounting evidence over recent months of a sustained pick-up in business expectations with the recent National Australia Bank, the Dun and Bradstreet and even the ACM surveys all pointing to an improvement in sentiment in the December quarter, and for the first time since 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Westpac's chief economist, Mr Bill Evans, comments that this points to a brighter 1994 and suggests that it represents a marked acceleration in the economy. This is good news for Australia. I think it demonstrates that the economy is certainly on the move. I would not suspect that it was good news for the opposition, hence its dispirited demeanour as it sees increasing evidence of the recovery taking hold in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mirror image of the leading index is the interest which the Leader of the Opposition takes in the economy. As I said earlier, he is only interested in talking about the economy when he can talk the economy down, when he can disparage the contribution of Australian working men and women in this country, and when he can disparage the efforts of Australian companies as they move to take advantage of the new opportunities which lie ahead of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there remains the issue of unemployment and how we reduce that over the months ahead. The government has quite clearly identified that as a clear area of priority for it in the months ahead. Having said that, this evidence, coming as it does from Westpac and the Melbourne Institute, relating to the leading index of economic activity and consumer sentiment, I think does portray the fact that the economy is clearly on the move, is clearly improving and that is what the government's policies have been all about. This is simply confirmation that those policies are right and working.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will always give the Taxation Office all the resources it needs in terms of manpower, equipment and decent policies. In that regard, I welcome the report that was handed down in the House yesterday by the public accounts committee, which conducted a two year investigation of the Australian Taxation Office. I commend honourable members and senators of the committee for their hard work and the report that they handed down. In particular, I was pleased to see that the committee gave endorsement to the direction of the Australian Taxation Office over the last 10 years particularly in relation to self-assessment, the modernisation program and the decentralisation program. It was a long report with many recommendations. I can assure the committee and the House that the government will give this report every consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report was more than just a majority report. There was included in it a dissenting report. For those who have not read it, I would recommend it. It is fascinating reading. I am in a position to make a few comments about that here today. In her dissenting report, Senator Bishop sought to abolish or water down many of the policies that add fairness to the taxation system. I will touch on a few of those now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I mention the capital gains tax. Those of us who were here in the 1980s remember that without the capital gains tax we had the lawyers and the accountants peddling the artificial schemes to all of those who could afford them. We understood, back in those days, that the people who were disadvantaged by that policy were ordinary working Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She also wants to fiddle with the FBT. Apparently it is all right for ordinary Australians to pay tax on all of their income but, for people who can split their income between paid income and income in kind&mdash;in the form of cars, zero interest loans, mortgages, school fees, overseas holidays, HBF and other things&mdash;apparently, according to Senator Bishop, that is okay; do not worry about paying tax on that because the workers will pick it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Self-assessment was another area that she attacked in the dissenting report. What she wants to do is take the Taxation Office back to the 1970s where every tax return had to be scrutinised. That was a very tiresome and meddlesome process. The self-assessment program was endorsed by the majority of the public accounts committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop also wanted to fiddle with the foreign income rules. Apparently it is okay for the smarties to do their taxation business over in the Cook Islands or the Bahamas. We will have none of that. If we take all of that out of the taxation policy, what is left? But we have to ask the question: what does the opposition say about this? What is its tax policy? Does it agree with Senator Bishop? In the last 24 hours, I have not heard anybody stand up and say that that is not coalition policy. If those opposite believe that that is a fair way to go, let them stand up and say so.</PARA>

The one thing that I am sure that all decent members of this House would agree with is the endorsement by the public accounts committee of the reputation of the former commissioner Trevor Boucher and its denunciation of the attack by Senator Bishop on the former taxation commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody in this place knows that former commissioner Boucher gave 40 years of his life to serving the people of Australia in the Australian Taxation Office. He has an unblemished record of service to this country. What did we get in front of the public accounts committee? I know it must have embarrassed the Liberal members on the committee to see Senator Bishop attack the taxation commissioner with some unfounded allegations that he sought to use his position to receive some gain for himself after 40 years of unblemished service. Does she not look a lonely figure today? And so she should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a cowardly attack on one of our best public servants&mdash;a public servant with a reputation for honesty and integrity not only in this country but also overseas. He was internationally renowned for the work that he did here. If that is not bad enough, the lack of leadership shown when Senator Bishop made those attacks should make every decent Australian sit up and take notice because the Leader of the Opposition should have called Senator Bishop into his office and said, `I used to work with Commissioner Boucher when I was on the staff of Treasurer Howard. I know him to be a man of honesty. I know him to be a man of integrity. What you did today was over the top'. That is what the Leader of the Opposition should have done. He should have shown some leadership on the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the Leader of the Opposition was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 23 October as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Hewson praised Mr Boucher's reforms of the Tax Office and said he would make a "fantastic contribution" as the OECD ambassador.</PARA>
<PARA>At least he had the decency to come out and recognise the good work Mr Boucher had done in the Tax Office and wish him well in his new post. However, the Leader of the Opposition could not sustain it, because on 27 October we saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> `Bishop backed in tax row', and in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> `Hewson support for Bishop'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is this: the Leader of the Opposition had it right the first time, but he could not help himself. He cannot bring himself to criticise a backbench senator when he knows that she is out of line. Mr Speaker, there is still a chance for the Liberal Party to show that there is some leadership outside of this parliament, if there is none inside it. I refer to the preselection panel for the seat of Mackellar. The members of the panel could say to Senator Bishop, `You have abused your position as a member of parliament in attacking public servants&mdash;in fact in attacking Commissioner Boucher. We will have nothing to do with you'. I hope they take that course of action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, let me say this: the government will look at the main report and will give it every consideration because it deserves it. But we will treat the dissenting report with the contempt that it deserves.</PARA>

The position is that we are still owed $2.5 million off a $5.5 million interest free loan. The position further is&mdash;it is understood by all and sundry, and I presume the honourable member does not have any disagreement with this&mdash;that the problem with the Letona cannery has been its management's failure. Therefore, the Commonwealth government is not going to give additional support to back up a company that has already failed and owes us money; and neither is the New South Wales government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said consistently to the New South Wales government that, if a new commercial operator does come into the field and takes over the operations and develops a cannery, which clearly there is the potential to do because of the specific, unique location of the operations and the horticultural activities of the region, there is a raft of Commonwealth government programs, together with state government programs, that can be put together to assist in that development. There are things such as the world best practices program to get better linkages between the growers and the producers; the international trade enhancement scheme and the marketing skills program. There is a range of programs. There is a one-stop shop to which the operator can go. To date, a new commercial proponent has not come forward, but we understand that a number have expressed interest, but certainly not to the stage at which they have finalised any proposition.</PARA>

I do not see any point in putting money&mdash;after what has already been put&mdash;into a badly managed operation, but I stand ready to support any new, viable proposition on the back of existing programs that the government has.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Deputy and Acting Prime Minister indicated, the Prime Minister is on his way to APEC for the APEC leaders' meeting, which is evidence of the increasing economic integration of the nations of the region and, most particularly, a measure of the integration of Australia with many of the countries of that region. It is for that reason that the government has been keen to compare the investment climate in Australia with those climates which operate in some of the countries of south-east and north-east Asia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question refers to comparable company tax rates in the east Asian area. Perhaps it is worth reminding the House of what those rates are for a selected group of countries. For Japan, the company rate of tax is 37 1/2 per cent; Taiwan, 25 per cent; Korea, 36 1/2 per cent; Thailand, 30 per cent; Malaysia, 34 per cent; Indonesia, 35 per cent; Singapore, 30 per cent; and the Philippines, 35 per cent. If one averages those rates which I have mentioned, the unweighted average in these economies would be 33 per cent. That is precisely the rate which now applies in Australia and, therefore, clearly puts Australia very much in touch with these economies on a comparable basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth mentioning that many of the countries which I have mentioned continue to have a system of double taxation. In other words, they do not have the system of dividend imputation of the kind we have in Australia and, therefore, these tax rates probably understate for those countries the actual impact of that rate of tax on the companies. In this context it is intriguing that, with the policy chaos that exists on the other side, the opposition has continued to embrace a 42 per cent tax rate. In other words, when invited to clarify the opposition's tax policy the other day, the shadow Treasurer was unable to give an alternative view to the proposition that the opposition was still wedded to the idea of a company tax rate of 42 per cent, which of course was the rate with which it went to the last election.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Everyone knows this, but it is only a symptom of the lack of confidence in the capacity and competence of the Treasurer amongst his cabinet colleagues and, indeed, amongst the backbench of the parliamentary Labor Party. The fact is that, ever since bringing down the budget on 17 August this year, the Treasurer's position in this government has been fundamentally destroyed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know only too well that the last election was an election fought on the issue of tax. I do not think Australians will forget between now and polling day the next time around in two or 2 1/2 years that the Labor Party promised in the lead-up to the election that it would not increase taxes, and then after the election immediately increased the burden of taxes on Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is interesting is that, after that act of betrayal in the budget by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) straight after the election, both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer went around telling Australians effectively, `Look, we are sorry about the increases in tax this time, but we promise we will not do it again. We will do it this time on 17 August, but we won't do it again'. For example, on 18 August, the Treasurer said to the National Press Club:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is no fiscal imperative for us to increase taxation further on the basis of achieving that deficit target.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So in terms of meeting the deficit reduction to about 1 per cent of GDP in 1996-97 there will be no fiscal imperative on us to raise taxes further.</PARA>
<PARA>It is strange language, I admit&mdash;`econotalk'. But what it means is that under Labor there will be no further increases in taxes over and above the increases that they have already brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing is that this statement by the Treasurer was undermined in recent days, on 10 November, in a speech given by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) to the Economic Society of Australia in Sydney. I do not think the Treasurer has read this speech, because it was not cleared with his office and he was unaware that the Minister for Finance was going to deliver this speech. When the Treasurer heard that the speech had been delivered, there was great anger in his office and much spleen was directed at the Minister for Finance. It is no wonder, because the Minister for Finance, in his speech&mdash;it is worth the Treasurer reflecting on this because I am sure he still has not read it all very carefully&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So dedication to the deficit reduction program will require constant government vigilance to keep expenditure under control.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed it will. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may also involve some revenue increases . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They are fatal political words for the Labor Party, because, although the Minister for Finance was clearly telling the truth in his speech and was once more showing that he is one of the few members of the cabinet who has genuine integrity on these matters, the Minister for Finance fatally undermined the position of a Treasurer who has been running around telling people, `I'm sorry we didn't tell the truth at the last election. I'm sorry we had to deceive the country. But, by the way, there won't be any additional deceit and there won't be any additional increases in taxes over and above the increases there have been'. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Gippsland says: why should we believe him? As a matter of fact, nobody does believe him. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister are the two most unbelievable people in the country. The Treasurer was much miffed by the Minister for Finance and he then rang around the Sunday newspapers. He likes to do this because he is frightened of the coalition. He is frightened that we will attack him and that the counterattack will give him yet another bloody nose. So he furtively rang around a few newspapers&mdash;presumably they published the reports fairly faithfully&mdash;and told them:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm opposed to future tax increases to meet the cost of any new obligations which come up . . . I see my job as resisting any claims for tax increases . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It has not been his job up until now, apparently. He has not been resisting those claims; he has been going to the cabinet with proposals for tax increases. What is interesting is that he says that he will resist them but he does not repeat what he said at the Press Club; that is, that there will be no need for them. That is the way the Treasurer operates. He tries to use too clever by half phrases and words which will leave him with some sort of out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Gippsland mentioned earlier, nobody would ever believe anything that the Treasurer has said. That has been the experience not just of us as politicians but also of an awful lot more people around the building, around this town and in the business community as well. For example, there was the wonderful saga of the Treasurer putting out a press release refuting an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. It said that he had left the CPI forecast in the budget deliberately higher&mdash;3 1/2 per cent&mdash;despite the fact that the Treasury had told him that its assessment of the CPI increase in the financial year would be a more modest one; I think 3.25 per cent. We know all of this. There is no point in trying to pretend that we do not. He knows only too well that the forecast that he put&mdash;the one which was allowed to go ahead in the budget&mdash;was not a reflection of the views of the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then the Treasurer put out a press release, when a journalist wrote about this matter, saying that it was totally untrue. He demonstrated all sorts of unction and concern about the falsehoods of the journalist, but behind the scenes the Treasurer was briefing Labor members, saying, `This is right. As a matter of fact, we did not ever expect the inflation rate to be 3 1/2 per cent as we published it'. When the next CPI figure came out he went around and said that apparently he would now downgrade the forecast; downgrade it to what the Treasury said it was earlier. That is a typical act from this Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have had many examples of this kind of loose behaviour with the truth from this Treasurer. As a consequence of that, and as a consequence of his obvious political ineptitude, he has lost the confidence&mdash;not of the opposition; it will never be very enthusiastic about a Labor Treasurer given the record of the Labor Party when it comes to economic management at the state and federal level&mdash;of his cabinet and colleagues. The Treasurer was rolled comprehensively on his favourite issue of bringing the budget forward to April or May rather than having it in August. The Minister for Finance fought tooth and nail in cabinet against the Treasurer and, in the end, the cabinet decided that it would give him a little out by saying that if he could reach agreement on a deadline with the Greens and the Australian Democrats then maybe they would consider it&mdash;all the time knowing that the Treasurer was unlikely to reach such an agreement and wanting to sabotage him but making sure that he could go out to the public with a face-saving formula. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same occurred with Australia Post. The Treasurer ran around briefing journalists that reform was urgently needed. He told them that we have to stop this slacking off of the pace of reform; that we have to accelerate the reform of Australia Post. He was again rolled in the cabinet. Some compromise was worked out to make the Treasurer look okay, but the fact is that the Treasurer was rolled on that issue because he lacks authority and the confidence of his cabinet. It is not surprising. It is well known around the building, and it is sometimes written by people in this building, that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) will relatively soon replace the Treasurer in his job. That, as I said, is well known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget and taxes will come back and haunt not just the Treasurer but the Prime Minister as well. When we look at the way that they have calculated the achievement of their deficit reduction target, we can see that it is based on assumptions&mdash;assumptions which have been heroically written into the budget papers but ones which do not stand up to the assumptions used by private sector economists or by the very reputable so-called alternative Treasury, Access Economics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer assumes that the economy will grow by four per cent in 1995-96 and four per cent in 1996-97. He assumes that, but if we use the assumptions that private sector forecasters such as Access Economics use we will see they expect the economy to grow by 2.9 per cent and 2.6 per cent in those years. What does that matter? That matters crucially because if Access Economics and the private sector are right the Treasurer and the government start with a $5 billion hole in their deficit reduction strategy. In other words, as the Minister for Finance has suggested, the government is secretly proposing to increase the tax burden on Australians by an additional $5 billion between now and 1996-97. The Minister for Finance has felt it necessary to lay the groundwork for the truth&mdash;I assume always recognising that the existing Treasurer will not be there when finally the policy is reversed and changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that either the government is proposing to increase taxes by $5 billion or so over the next few years or else its deficit reduction strategy is just in tatters. Alternatively, there will be a blow-out in the deficit and the government will not get anywhere near the strategy that it is pretending it will achieve. What further evidence is there of this secret plan of the Labor Party to increase taxes than the way the budget papers themselves are constructed? They have details, year by year to 1996-97, of outlays and growth in outlays in different portfolios. The budget papers tell us precisely what the defence budget will be for 1995-96 and precisely what expenditure in the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services will be. But what does it not tell us? It does not tell us how the government will get the money to finance these things. There is no detailed breakdown, year by year, of revenue&mdash;only of outlays. It is perfectly obvious it does not have the breakdown of revenue because it plans to increase taxes over and above the increases that were already imposed on Australians as a result of the budget on 17 August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says that it cannot reduce spending to fund any of this, that it is utterly and absolutely impossible to reduce expenditure in this country. Let me remind the House of something that I think people should take back to their electorates and speak to Australians generally about. In this financial year alone, the running costs of government departments are to increase by nearly three per cent. Over the last three years, the average increase in running costs of departments has been five per cent per annum. Are the running costs of departments very expensive? The answer is that they are extraordinarily expensive. This year $11 1/2 billion will be spent on the running costs of government departments. If we take that one item of expenditure, its puts into some perspective the inefficiency of the way the government works and the absolute stupidity of a government saying that in no way whatsoever it can reduce spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Finance said, add to the government's $5 billion blow-out in taxes expenditure on Mabo compensation as well as expenditure on the Olympic Games, which may not be very much over the next three or so years, and we end up with a very sizeable hole with very sizeable increases in taxes confronting Australians&mdash;and a government and a Treasurer who say one thing one day and do another thing the next. This, in the end, is a government which will fall on the issue of taxation. It will fall because it deceived Australians in a way every man, woman and child in this country knows of. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

This debate really represents a recognition of the failure of the Liberal Party to score one point during the budget debate. It set itself the objective of knocking off four or five tax measures which the government had included in its budget. It succeeded on not one of them: it failed absolutely in the objectives which it set itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the support of the House of Representatives and the Senate, the government put into effect a deficit reduction strategy which will see the government's deficit reduction target met in 1996-97. In the context of that deficit reduction strategy, we produced our forward estimates of expenditure and receipts. What a joke that the honourable member for Mayo, in defence of his point, raises Access Economics&mdash;otherwise known as `excess economics'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Access Economics was the primary architect of the opposition's failed strategy&mdash;failed policy&mdash;which the people of Australia threw out so absolutely at the time of the last election. Now we find the failed architect of the opposition's policy being drawn in as pessimistic support for its views on where the economy will be in a few years time. It is as though the honourable member for Mayo would welcome the fact that the economy might be growing by only 2 1/2 per cent in a couple of years time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the honourable member for Mayo is actually trying to wish Australia into slower growth and higher unemployment. The point that the opposition cannot comprehend is that the economy is improving, jobs are being created and the government has now, in legislated form, a deficit reduction strategy, which the opposition sought to wreck but was totally incapable of doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has, as any government would, publicly put out its forward projections of expenditure and revenue based on the conservative projections which are included in the economic parameters and announced in the budget. They are assumptions&mdash;assumptions derived from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Fiscal Outlook</EMPHASIS> and supported by the FitzGerald report. From a range of scenarios, we took the midpoint as the basis for those assumptions&mdash;a point which, I am quite sure, would be totally lost on the honourable member for Mayo as he struggles to even comprehend what a national fiscal outlook statement might be, and as he struggles to comprehend what a national savings strategy might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next three years there will be demands for additional government expenditure&mdash;that is inevitable&mdash;but the expenditure pressures of which I am aware can be accommodated by the government carefully examining its priorities and achieving cost savings in lower priority areas without the need for additional tax measures in order to meet those demands. We have spent 11 years painfully going through the process of readjusting priorities to take away some of the extravagance of the former Liberal government and reducing, as a proportion of GDP, Commonwealth expenditure from approximately 30 per cent down to about 24 per cent. We are on our way back to about 25 per cent on the basis of the forward estimates. </PARA>

The committee on employment opportunities will be preparing a green paper and there will be a deliberate process of community consultation to be followed by the publication of a government white paper. In the context of the green paper, ACOSS has proposed a jobs levy to fund additional spending in this area. It has proposed some very considerable expenditures. I do not know whether the community would support those additional expenditures or the kinds of projects which it has in mind or whether, in that context, the community would support the additional revenue raising measures which ACOSS has proposed to fund them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I was saddened when listening to the speech of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to the House this afternoon because a man who came into this House with great idealism and some ability has fallen so low that he has to resort to such a pernicious attack upon the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). It was low, it was disgraceful, and I think it demonstrates that the Treasurer is unfit for office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In just over three weeks the people of my state, South Australia, will have their chance to say just what they think of Labor's taxes and Labor's promises. It is true to say that they hardly need to look to Canberra for an excuse to throw out the state Labor government. There are already 3.5 billion good reasons to dump Lynn Arnold and his team of incompetents. If, as expected, the State Bank needs yet another bailout there will be a few million more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax cuts delivered this week will give Australians an extra $1.66 billion in their pockets this financial year, and an additional $12.2 billion in the next four years. But the tax increases that this `no new taxes' government has brought in mean that every Australian will be forced to shell out an extra $1,800 to the government over the next four years. Ordinary Australians know that they will be worse off. Labor's new taxes mean that every household will be slugged for an additional $5,650 on top of the taxes that they are already paying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People will not forget that the Labor Party dumped the second round of tax cuts&mdash;tax cuts estimated to be worth $5.2 billion in 1995-96; tax cuts that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised them. At least South Australians will have an opportunity to pass a comment on 11 December. The comment will not be kind; it will be harsh, it will be brutal and it will be deserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clowns from Adelaide's Trades Hall are busy shouting about the privations that they say South Australians will suffer under a Liberal government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premier announced the election date in the suburb of Barton, a new development in his electorate on the very edge of Adelaide's northern suburbs. One of his minders told a journalist that he picked the location to show his support for working South Australians. Despite this, the people of Barton&mdash;and the dozens of suburbs like it&mdash;will be the ones who suffer most from Labor's losses. They are the ones who have had to wait longer to get new schools. They have poorer social services and community facilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In South Australia the government has closed 170 schools, I might tell my friend the honourable member for Gilmore. Do not talk to me about Victoria. The people of Barton have less access to public utilities such as proper sewerage, they have worse roads and less frequent transport serving fewer routes. However, they paid more in taxes and charges as the government desperately tried to wipe the slate clean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating government is hitting exactly the same people. Its tax cuts help high income earners. Its tax increases are highly regressive. Ordinary Australians are paying more every time they fill up the family car after dropping the kids to school, driving to work, getting to sport, or whatever. They are paying more every time they buy a soft drink. They are paying more if they buy household appliances or electrical goods. They are paying more when they grab a cask of wine for the barbecue or the picnic. They are even giving more money to the government every time they buy an absolute essential like a pack of soap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is how the Labor Party shows its support for true believers. It rips them off without any shame. It mouths pieties. It repeats worn phrases all the time, and they mean nothing to the government. The Labor Party dares to portray us as rapacious exploiters, as vindictive would-be oligarches, jealous of what ordinary Australians have been able to achieve, whilst the government's tax measures destroy the living standards and even the livelihoods of the people that it claims to champion. Labor now intends to further increase taxes. Rather than look for savings, rather than trim its programs, rather than toss fewer grants to its marginal seats, or make government run better, it intends to wring more money out of innocent taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sudden bout of candour of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) last week has let the cat out of the bag. The government cannot satisfy its deficit reduction strategy without resorting to higher taxes. Projections tabled in the Senate have shown that tax revenue needs to grow by 8.1 per cent in real terms in the next financial year, by six per cent in 1995-96, and by five per cent in 1996-97 to meet the target. That means that the government needs an average real growth of 6.4 per cent over the three years, or a nominal increase in the tax take between this year and the 1996-97 financial year of a whopping 32 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is to raise this revenue, it has only three options. It can do so through higher inflation; we all know how likely and how damaging this option would be. It can do so through strong growth; that is what the government likes to think it is doing, but there are very real concerns over the actual state of the economy. Reports have suggested that Treasury and the Reserve Bank believe economic growth is still weak. Many private sector economists have forecast substantially lower growth in the September quarter. If we have an upturn, it is slow, cyclical and unable to produce anything more than an unacceptably low rate of growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures produced by Access Economics show that the budget has overestimated economic growth, which will reduce government income, lead to greater expenditure and place the government deficit reduction target in even greater jeopardy. That leaves only one option: increased or more new taxes. In August, at budget time, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) told the National Press Club, `There will be no fiscal imperative on us  to raise further taxes'. Now the finance minister has finally come clean. The government likes to claim that we are a low tax country. It holds up statistics comparing us to the United States and Europe. However, tax levels in Australia are double those of our east Asian neighbours. If Australia is to compete effectively in our region taxation levels must be reduced, not increased. The government's high tax policies do not just cost Australians more money, they cost them jobs. Labor's promises are empty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at least in South Australia we are going to get the chance to tell the ALP just how worthless it is. In South Australia, the people will not just be tossing out ministers&mdash;such as Greg Crafter, Kym Mayes, Bob Gregory and John Klunder&mdash;because of their gross financial mismanagement, they will be giving the ALP a record hiding because they know that Labor governments cannot be trusted. The people know that all the glossy brochures and all the pious words are, and can be, disregarded. They know that Labor's pre-election promises mean absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people know all this because they have seen how the Keating government behaves. They all remember the solemn pledges not to increase taxes that this government made. They all saw the Prime Minister put on his hurt look and tell us that tax cuts were law. The people all learnt on 17 August that they had been conned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What makes the Labor Party and its union mates' much voiced support for the poor, for the underprivileged and for ordinary Australians that honourable members opposite keep talking about&mdash;in South Australia and nationwide&mdash;so absolutely sickening, is the actual way it governs. John Bannon, Lynn Arnold and the rest of the South Australian Labor ministry have managed to lose more than $3 billion. Ordinary South Australians will pay for it. But on 11 December, the South Australian Labor Party will pay the ultimate price. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak to this matter of public importance, it is worth noting that we had, first of all, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) speaking about Australia Post and virtually everything else except the matter that is before the chair. Then we had the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) wanting to basically play some role in the South Australian election campaign, and that was really the sum total of his contribution to the matter of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we come back to what are the key issues&mdash;and we look at, first of all, the government's deficit reduction strategy and the question of taxation&mdash;we find that the government can quite rightly point to the very positive steps that have been taken to reduce the overall level of income tax, particularly to increase the competitive position of business relating to taxation, to ensure that we have a fair taxation system and to ensure that the sorts of regressive, negative and damaging impacts that the Liberals would have sought to impose if it won the 1993 election, which were so soundly rejected, are not allowed to be revisited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition really hates the fact that the Australian economy is starting to turn around. It really detests the fact that the Australian economy has not double dipped but has kept growing. We have now had seven quarters of positive growth in the economy. That is something that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) willed his hardest not to happen, but it has happened in spite of him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had constant suggestions that there would need to be a move to push up interest rates when bill rates have kept coming down. We have had the constant suggestion that there needs to be changes at the fiscal end because of our overall position in the world economy. Almost anywhere one goes around the world, people looking at Australia have said, `You have had seven quarters of positive growth. You have had some fiscal expansion in the short term to help create the economic stimulus that is required'. This government started doing that but we were decried by the opposition in the One Nation statement as following the wrong strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, since then, the new Japanese government has decided that there needs to be some fiscal stimulus to get its economy going. At one stage some of those opposite felt that Canada should be the model to be followed. But Canada's government lost the election&mdash;in fact, it was wiped out. It had some of the policies that some of those opposite advocated before our last election. I think Canada had a GST, or some similar sort of beast, but the Canadian people, and the new government, have now said, `These are issues that were wrong. We have to go back and change. Apart from anything else, we have to have some fiscal stimulus in the short term for our economy'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After two decades of the opposition encouraging and promoting an environment with high inflation and high interest rates, and after the 1982-83 recessionary period with double digit interest rates and inflation, this government has moved to get interest rates down to their lowest level in 30 years, and to get inflation down. Yet the opposition says that it has the answers today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing it has said adds anything to the economic debate. The tax cuts delivered last Monday are the tax cuts that the opposition opposed being delivered seven months early. It tried its hardest in the Senate to get the budget measures knocked over. It was desperate to stop those measures being brought forward. The honourable member for Sturt, who suggested that taxes be put off and scrapped, was one of those who opposed giving the tax cuts seven months early. He should be accountable to his electorate for trying to stop average wage earners in his electorate getting their tax cuts delivered on 15 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the question of taxation relating to business and the competitiveness of Australian business versus similar economies in the region. This government has already moved to cut the level of company taxation from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. It is certainly competitive with our trading partners and with countries in the region. At the same time, I believe that the opposition still has a policy of going back to a 42 per cent company tax rate. It actually wants to take the company tax rate to above 39 per cent. I do not know what the rest of its taxation policy is. One thing for sure is that in the contribution of the honourable member for Mayo we did not get one fact, one suggestion or one comment about what the opposition's taxation arrangements might be in the future&mdash;not even half a policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as we can understand it, its GST has gone; it has learnt that lesson. It took the opposition a few months too long to learn it, but it did. We also know that Senator Bishop, the would-be leader, believes that things such as capital gains tax have to go. I do not know how many of the other taxation arrangements that are in place have to go. We have had no policy statement from the opposition on those issues. We assume that it still has the $10 billion worth of public expenditure cuts that were part of its package before the election. If anyone wants to know a recipe to damage the people who most need assistance in the economy, a slashing of $10 billion worth of outlays is the sure way to ensure that happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next two to three years, Australia needs to keep promoting the level of growth which has occurred in recent times. That is the fundamentally important policy objective for Australia. That needs to be the driving force for keeping the economic strategy in line because the deficit reduction strategy over the next four years, when we get down to approximately one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, is built around continuing to get stable, consistent and positive economic policies, an appropriate level of fiscal outlays over that time, and a gradual winding back as the private sector picks up its momentum through that period and jobs grow at the same time. The last lot of employment data clearly show that that process is occurring very positively and that participation rates are growing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the honourable member for Mayo, one of the reasons why we had to put up new taxes was that Sydney was successful in its bid to host the Olympic Games. In bidding for the Olympic Games, the Premier of New South Wales made it very clear that the New South Wales government felt that it could run the games without having to raise any funds from the Commonwealth or elsewhere, other than the $150 million that the federal government has already committed to the project. Time and time again the New South Wales Liberal Party said publicly that that was the net contribution required. So, really, the honourable member for Mayo should go back and ask his state Liberal colleague in New South Wales why those facts changed within about 24 hours of Sydney successfully bidding for the games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to look quickly at the concerns relating to revenue and the way the government has managed its fiscal position over the 10 years we have been in office and contrast that with what has occurred in the past. This government had three successive budget surpluses in the late 1980s, highlighting the fact that we maintain stringent controls over outlays, closely monitor expenditure and undertake a very vigorous process through the expenditure review committee looking at all the line items of expenditure and take appropriate action to ensure that the overall budget position is kept within responsible bounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast those three years of budget surpluses, when the economy was moving strongly, with the approach of the opposition parties when in government. Even when the economy was growing quite strongly, the coalition parties in government still had deficit after deficit and one problem after another in being able to rein in expenditure and maintain a responsible budget. When we are faced with the cyclical impact of the recession and the severity of the needs of many in the community, the opposition suggests that somehow expenditure can be slashed and that ordinary citizens and those who are in need should not be given financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In both the preparation of the green paper that is coming and the major employment statement that will follow, the government has made it clear that it will not leave behind the people who need assistance&mdash;namely, the people who, responsibly, should be considered as part of the changing conditions in the economy, as part of the structural changes that are occurring in the economy. The government will take account of the needs of those people. The government will ensure both sound and responsible budget outlays. The government will also ensure a socially humane and effective policy of a broad infrastructure net to look after all the needs of the community, across all the regions of Australia, including those regions with particular problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, I say very strongly that the deficit reduction plan that has been adopted will stay; it is workable and it will be achieved. The economy will continue to grow and prosper because of the positive and constructive policies the government has put in place over recent years. It ill becomes the opposition to keep trying to talk the Australian economy down and trying to wreak more harm on the people of Australia at the very time we should be trying to give the hope and stimulus that the figures in the economic performance suggest are quite rightly occurring each and every day. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) has indicated, these amendments have been agreed to in the Senate. If I read what happened in the Senate debate correctly, it had an explanatory memorandum; but we are not favoured with the same information in this House. I suppose that is not altogether surprising. These amendments comprise proposals to the government, at the behest of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. Further amendments are proposed on the initiative of the opposition, in the person of Senator John Watson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just received a copy of the Senate explanatory memorandum. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could enlighten the committee on why we did not get some information. It is important that the House contribute to debate on the legislation. In the debate here on 27 September, when about seven bills were debated cognately after they had been introduced, we were presented with up to 20 pages of amendments&mdash;subsequent to the presentation of the bills before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have another few pages. This demonstrates the government's ad hoc approach to legislation on superannuation. Combining those circumstances with the bills under consideration, and the fact that there have been 14 or 15 major amendments to superannuation legislation during the term of this Labor government, it can be understood why practitioners in the industry, possible beneficiaries and superannuants are at a loss to know where they stand and what are their rights and obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very messy legislation. One can only hope that when the amendments are passed the act, as it will become, will be in a better and more readable condition than the information we were given even in the first instance in September and now in the bill before the House. It makes a farce of the summing up to the second reading debate by the parliamentary secretary in September when he offered a stout defence of the government's skill in drafting legislation. It was wrong at the time for the reasons I have given. We had up to 20 pages of amendments to consider to legislation which previously had been lodged in the House. Now we have more. At one stage he even claimed they were right on top of superannuation legislation. Today's events and those in September give the lie to that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of some credit to Senator Watson, who chaired the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, that the legislation&mdash;by these further amendments&mdash;is being knocked into some sort of shape. As I have said before in other contexts, if we devoted more time in this place to the legislative process, and if the House were given the sort of information that is provided to the Senate at the second reading stage and the subsequent committee stage, we might not have to go through all this agony in deliberating Senate amendments. The Senate truly is the legislative chamber. We have let that role go by default. Having said that, and subject to anything the parliamentary secretary might say, we support the amendments. We regret only that they were not incorporated in the original legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the amendment be disagreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>If people were following the debate on the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1993 in the Senate, they would know that the Greens, the Australian Democrats and the Liberals have moved that the government consider the notion that we establish a legal and advisory service for those involved in superannuation disputes with their trustees. I think those people have failed to understand that in fact the government will establish a tribunal through this bill and will establish a secretariat of some 18 people who will be able to look after consumers' interests and will spend about $800,000 doing it. It is the wish of people, in addition to those moves, to establish a consumer legal service for the express purposes of representing individuals before the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that the tribunal will act in an inquiry manner. We prefer not to have an advocacy situation which will probably spin out these questions and make them more expensive. Whilst a number of honourable senators in the other house were suggesting that we establish such an independent legal service, they did not want to fund it&mdash;they did not want to push us that far&mdash;but they asked us for some reasons. They wanted our reasoning on this question of support for a legal and advisory service. So I am here today to provide those reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the government is doing a great deal in spending about $800,000 to establish a tribunal. Individuals will be given free access to it and will be allowed the assistance of a secretariat of some 18 people. That will be free of charge to the individual. The tribunal will be looking for conciliation of matters&mdash;not just an arbitration of them. I think that is essential. We feel that, in most instances, these cases will be able to be conciliated and will not require a decision by the tribunal standing in the shoes of the trustees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Keep in mind also that we have not yet established the tribunal. It will not be up and working until July next year. I think it needs some time to bed down, to see how many cases it gets, what sorts of cases it gets, the complexity of those cases and the ratio of successful and unsuccessful decisions, et cetera. I think we will build a good system. The tribunal will be independent. The secretariat will be separate from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. There is no reason why it should side with individuals, trustees or insurance companies. The tribunal can be truly independent, and I think we should show good faith in going along with the bill unamended. We do not support the notion of spending another $666,000 to establish a legal and advisory service. I believe we have already done that work by establishing the tribunal and the secretariat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The assurances of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) are noted and are welcome. I think what concerned our colleagues in the Senate was the inevitability that many of the people wishing to have matters resolved would be relatively unsophisticated and unskilled in the vagaries of the relevant legislation. The parliamentary secretary says that the tribunal to be established will fulfil the role. The coalition is prepared to accept that at least for the time being. But I urge the honourable gentleman and his government to keep it in mind that tribunals tend to become captives of themselves and that, depending on the way they are established, their guidelines and stated objectives, they may fail to provide the protection that could otherwise be provided in a manner suggested by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things which I am sure would have concerned the Senate is that, whilst there will be a tribunal, access to it will be necessarily difficult for people not living within the vicinity of where that tribunal is established. As far as I know&mdash;I stand to be corrected by the parliamentary secretary&mdash;the tribunal is not to be represented in other states and in other capital cities. Remembering that people who will need the assistance the tribunal sets out to provide will be spread around the country, it is difficult to imagine how they can get access without&mdash;in some cases anyway&mdash;going to considerable expense. So there is the prospect that the facilities the tribunal might be able to provide will not be there for everyone to use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the parliamentary secretary can correct me if I am wrong in any of the fundamental assumptions I have made in arriving at that conclusion. Given the relative novelty of the principal proposal, it is, however, reasonable to allow some time to see how it beds down and to see whether the objectives of the Senate and the coalition can be satisfied. A sum of money has been mentioned by the parliamentary secretary in giving this extra protection to superannuants and those who might want to refer matters for conciliation and resolution. We will be prepared to wait to see how the program goes. The expenditure of $660,000-odd is considerable and not to be undertaken lightly. Given, as I say, the novelty of the program itself, we perhaps should wait to see how it goes. I urge the government, however, to keep the matter under review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) for his comments and consideration of our point of view. To explain one element, we do not envisage that many will come in person to the tribunal. Most of the work will be done on paper, but we are open to the notion of telephoning, video conferences and so forth. The honourable member is quite right: people should have access to the tribunal despite their being located perhaps in Perth. But we want as much as possible to keep this program non-adversarial, based on paperwork with qualified people sitting as tribunal members with the assistance of a secretariat. As yet, none of us knows how many people or how complex the cases will be. In that instance, I am grateful to the honourable member's views that we should let the program settle in so that we can have a good look at it to see how it works over a reasonable period.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The committee's sixth report of 1993 relates to a proposal sponsored by Australian Estate Management for the partial refurbishment of the Hobart Commonwealth Centre stage 1. AEM proposes to refurbish and upgrade the five upper floors of the office accommodation, the ground floor lobby area and associated building infrastructure. Some asbestos present in the 14th floor plant room will also be removed. The net lettable area of office space to be refurbished is 4,600 square metres. The limit of cost estimate for the project when referred to the committee was $8.3 million at September 1993 prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AEM is a budget funded operation of the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services and has overall responsibility to government for the management and development of the Commonwealth's office estate. In 1989 the Commonwealth's office estate was commercialised and departments were charged for the first time for the use of accommodation. In 1991, as part of the public sector reform process, the government decided to allow all departments to negotiate office leasing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This effectively means that AEM is now in direct competition with the private sector in providing office accommodation to departments. The only exception to this is in the ACT where departments are still tied to the Commonwealth for the approval of changes in office accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hobart site was acquired by the Commonwealth in 1969 and the stage 1 building was completed and occupied in 1974. The stage 1 building provides over 15,000 square metres of office accommodation or about 25 per cent of the total Commonwealth requirements in Hobart. The stage 2 building was completed in May 1992, and comprises some 9,000 square metres of office accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1991 the government approved the development of cost estimates and detailed design for the refurbishment of the stage 1 building. Later investigations, however, established that a refurbishment of the entire building was not at that time viable due to insufficient tenant interest for the space available. In December 1992 a reduced scope of refurbishment work was agreed by government subject to tenant commitment to occupancy of the refurbished space. The commitment was subsequently obtained and approval to proceed to reference to the committee was given on 14 April 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until November 1992 the stage 1 building was fully tenanted. At this time, the Australian Taxation Office relocated to an adjacent building leased from the private sector under a pre-commitment lease arrangement. The ATO relocation left some 7,000 square metres of space in the building vacant. Although AEM sought to retain ATO as a tenant it was unable to guarantee funds for the refurbishment of the building in a time frame which suited ATO's operational requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stage 1 building is ideally located close to major retail, business and service outlets. It is also close to public transport and public parking facilities and is readily accessible to both the public and building tenants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present condition of the stage 1 building and the standard of accommodation it offers is, however, below the requirements of expectations of tenant departments and also well below that provided in the market generally. It is therefore unattractive to potential tenants and is not competitive in its unrefurbished state. The building does not comply with current building standards and the condition of the decor and finishes has deteriorated with protracted use. In addition, the building services are nearing the end of their economic life and do not meet the operational or energy efficiency needs of modern office accommodation&mdash;a bit of a mess, in other words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth owns some 27,000 square metres of office space in Hobart and also leases a further 33,000 square metres from the private sector. The committee was concerned to note that stage 1 of the Commonwealth Centre contains some nine floors containing 8,000 square metres of office space that it is not proposed to refurbish until tenants have been identified. However, at the public hearing AEM advised the committee that it believes there is a potential market among Commonwealth tenants currently in privately leased buildings of some 10,000 square metres over the next three to five years. In addition, AEM believes that it is possible that there will be some growth by the tenants that have committed themselves to the five floors to be refurbished over this period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognises that the new government policy regarding the renting of Commonwealth accommodation does make departments more aware of the real cost of accommodation. However, it is concerned that policy may not be in the best overall interests of the Commonwealth if it leads to Commonwealth facilities remaining vacant while government departments lease private accommodation. The committee does not believe that it makes good sense for such a high proportion of the space in an asset such as the Hobart Commonwealth Centre, which is located in a prime position, to remain vacant while departments are renting private accommodation in adjacent buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, while agreeing that there is a need to refurbish the 4,600 square metres of stage 1 of the Commonwealth Centre as proposed in this reference, has also concluded that there is a need to refurbish as part of this project the remaining floors of stage 1 in order to attract additional tenants. The committee has also recommended that the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) should undertake a review of the current policy regarding the provision of office accommodation for Commonwealth departments to ensure that the operation of the policy is in the best overall interests of the Commonwealth and encourages the maximum utilisation of existing Commonwealth office accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report which I have tabled deals with the proposed construction of air traffic control centres in Brisbane and Melbourne required for the Australian advanced air traffic system, otherwise known as TAAATS. This project, as many would be aware, has had a long and somewhat tortuous passage. I remind the House that the proposed works were originally referred to the committee early last year. We had numerous public and private hearings in Brisbane, Canberra and Perth amidst considerable controversy concerning the awarding of the TAAATS contract to Thomson Radar Australia Corporation Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This controversy spilled over into the committee's inquiry, although I made it plain at the outset that the committee did not wish to involve itself in issues relating to equipment contracts. A large number of witnesses expressed unease about the processes which had resulted in the CAA awarding the contract to Thomson. As a result, and because of the unwillingness or inability of key Civil Aviation Authority witnesses to answer key questions, I made a statement in the House on 3 June last year which called on the then Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Cook, to set up an independent panel to carry out a thorough review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To Senator Cook's enduring credit, he appointed the Honourable Ian Macphee to undertake the review. The rest is now history. Mr Macphee's report was scathing of senior officials of the CAA and recommended that the tender selection process should be restarted with both Hughes and Thomson being involved in specification development before submitting competitive bids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal was re-referred to the committee in July. We had public and private hearings in Brisbane in October, and there was a profound change in attitude towards the committee by the key players at the hearings. The chief executive officer of the CAA, Doug Roser, led the CAA's team of witnesses and answered all our questions in a frank and open manner. There was no equivocation. We were given detailed briefings on the building designs by both tenderers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also had the benefit of advice from an independent auditor who was appointed to report to the CAA board on the relevance, integrity, probity and fairness of the evaluation of tenders. The committee's report recommends that the works should proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long Australia's air traffic control system has been a patchwork of hybrid systems some of which are ancient, some of which are relatively modern, whose installation was subject to the vagaries of the budget processes every year. The TAAATS project is a bold initiative. It will provide integration of all en route air traffic control in two centres&mdash;one in Brisbane and the other in Melbourne. Both centres require to be in modern buildings incorporating sophisticated building services. Brisbane and Melbourne are suitable locations, being at the termination points of existing communications infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private briefings which were given to the committee by the tenderers demonstrated to the satisfaction of the committee that the dimensions and functional layout of the centres proposed by them are adequate and provide for future expansion if necessary. The committee intends to maintain a watching brief on the project as it progresses and we have recommended as a first step that the CAA brief us on the detailed design of each centre following the awarding of the TAAATS contract in December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Terminal control units, which will be responsible for controlling air traffic in the vicinity of major airports, such as Sydney, Perth, Cairns and Adelaide, will also be provided as part of the project. The committee has concluded that the extent of the work required to accommodate these units is justified and makes good use of existing buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the report makes the observation that the project has had a long and tortuous development. The committee's report, which I have just tabled, and the awarding of the TAAATS contract in December, will mark the end of a painful process, from which a lot has been learned, and the beginning of a new chapter in Australian aviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third&mdash;and, thankfully, final&mdash;report which I have tabled today refers to the proposed upgrading of broadcasting facilities at Mount Wellington in Hobart. The existing Commonwealth owned transmission tower has been significantly modified during its life and carries additional services for which it was not originally intended. The tower is not capable of further major extension and is nearing the end of its useful life due to structural fatigue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal by the National Transmission Agency, the NTA, involves the construction of a tower consisting of a 70-metre tapered concrete shaft supporting a 60-metre steel frame upon which is mounted several transmission antennas and a protective fibreglass radar. The work also includes alterations and upgrading of the existing transmitter building, demolition of the existing broadcasting tower and site rehabilitation. The estimated cost of the work is $13.095 million at September 1993 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new tower is required in order to achieve government policy for the expansion of broadcasting services; to improve the quality of services already provided to the Hobart public by increasing their reliability through overcoming technical difficulties in the existing tower; to improve the safety of the public and maintenance workers at the site; and to reduce maintenance costs. Construction of the new tower will also provide an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of transmission facilities on Mount Wellington. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national services transmitted from the existing tower are subject to interruption for periods some ten times longer than equivalent services in other metropolitan areas of Australia. This is a result of faults caused by the poor condition of the tower and the NTA's inability to gain access to the structure in adverse weather conditions to rectify the faults. In order to bring further broadcasting services to Southern Tasmania and to pre-empt the possible structural failure of the existing tower, the proposal to erect a new structure at the existing site on Mount Wellington was developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed tower must accommodate services currently transmitted from the existing tower and, in addition, it needs to provide capacity for the proposed new television licensee, Southern Cross TV and for additional FM radio services. The NTA has also allowed capacity for all foreseeable broadcasting and radio communication needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consideration was also given to providing capacity for the existing Hobart commercial television licensee, Tasmanian Television, to be accommodated on the tower on the existing VHF channel 6. This would have required a tower 151 metres in height compared to the NTA proposal to the committee of 130 metres in height and an additional cost of approximately $2 million. However, Tasmanian Television has not agreed to move from its existing facility on Mount Wellington and was not prepared to give any commitment to using the VHF capacity if such additional capacity was to be included in the new tower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry it became clear to the committee that a desirable objective is a consolidation of all broadcasting facilities on Mount Wellington into one tower. At issue is the ability to remove an existing transmission facility located on Mount Wellington owned and operated by Tasmanian Television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NTA advised the committee that the management of Tasmanian Television has consistently and repeatedly stated that they have no plans to share the proposed NTA facility. While provision was not made on the tower proposal referred to the committee for Tasmanian Television's present VHF channel, provision was made to accommodate it on a UHF channel. However, at the public hearing NTA advised the committee that it was now able to offer Tasmanian Television VHF capacity without the need for the additional 21 metres of tower column. This would entail the installation of an antenna system on the NTA facility which would enable capacity for Tasmanian Television's channel 6 to be provided in the NTA proposal. In agreeing that the NTA proposal should proceed the committee has also recommended that the Commonwealth should consult with the management of Tasmanian Television regarding the possible use of a VHF facility by Tasmanian Television in the upgraded broadcasting facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also concluded that there is no environmentally or socially acceptable alternatives to the continued use of Mount Wellington as a broadcasting transmission site. The committee has further concluded that the proposed integration of the NTA's proposal with the proposed aerial tramway service to the summit of Mount Wellington is not practical and would lead to unacceptable delays in the provision of upgraded broadcasting facilities on Mount Wellington. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the reports to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. Its purpose is to give more flexibility in the industrial relations area by facilitating enterprise bargaining while maintaining the historical safety net of the award structure as a protection for working people in Australia. That has been there since just after Federation. I believe that because we have those awards in place it assists Australians to have the quality of life which they presently enjoy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very interested to listen to the arguments of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who were the two main speakers from the other side to oppose this bill. I was disappointed by both their speeches. They did not seem to get into the hype which I thought they would. I think their arguments have basically been rejected by most of the speeches from this side already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of points I want to deal with first of all. Their main argument was the continuing one of reducing conditions and wages for the Australian work force; that somehow, if we did that, it would be a magic answer to unemployment and there would be great productivity gains. That argument is totally wrong and this side of the House has continually rejected it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong used figures from the United States. He said that the US had only six per cent unemployment and, therefore, there was something wrong with us because we had a more flexible labour market yet our figures were at 11 per cent. The figures that I got from America last year were 7.4 per cent. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Downer" NAMEID="4G4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr Downer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It's 6.5.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BV5">Mr ADAMS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow minister at the table says that it is now 6.5 per cent. Let me quote him a few other figures on unemployment from the United Kingdom and other OECD countries. Unemployment in the United Kingdom in 1992 was at 10.1 per cent; in Canada, 11.3 per cent; Denmark, 11.1 per cent; and, Spain, 18.4 per cent. For the smaller countries in Europe, the figure was around 10.6 per cent. New Zealand, with its great cuts in wages and the social conflict that has been caused, was at 10.3 per cent. The average figure for OECD countries stood at about eight per cent, with most of the European Economic Community on an average 10.1 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that was put forward by the honourable member for Bennelong really falls down on those figures. He was very selective in the figures that he used. His argument was that the US has more poverty, bigger collapses of family life and dislocation of its social infrastructure than Australia, but it has less unemployment. I thought the argument was rather shallow. I believe that one of the problems in the United States is that it does not have an award structure and workers in that country certainly do not have the protection that they have in this country. I believe that some of the workers in America are very poor and that there is a certain level of working poor that we do not have in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wages can be reduced to any level. If wages are reduced, we will get people who are very poor, trying to survive on wages that leave them no dignity. They are reduced to poverty, even though they have a job. Sometimes they have to rely on charities to survive. In summary, that is the position at the bottom end of the America labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have as many breakdowns in our families or the same levels of poverty in this country as America, mainly because we have an award safety net. I also believe that our unemployment benefits and other social benefits are superior to that available in America. In recent times, in the area of health, that has been pointed out quite openly through our media. So the argument of the honourable member for Bennelong about unemployment rates in Australia&mdash;which took up about two-thirds of his speech&mdash;is very shallow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party, as it did during the election campaign, rejects the position that cutting wages and conditions is in some way the simple answer to solving unemployment. It is not. We rejected it and we went to the election on it. The Liberals ran on a policy along those lines and were rejected by the people. The Labor Party stands for an increase in productivity, and that comes through training, improvement in job quality, lowering the amount of middle management and improving the overall performance of a company. Those things will improve productivity more than cutting wages will. Most of the academic reading in this area that I do now, and have done in the last couple of months, points exactly to the fact that, by cutting wages or by having a low wage economy, we cannot get quality production, goods and organisations within manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong commented about women in the work force and the increase in part-time work in Australia. The situation only mirrors what is happening in most other countries. If we look at figures in other countries comparable to our own, we see exactly the same thing. There has been a great surge in part-time work and an increase in the amount of women in the work force. They are changes in society which all of those economies and societies similar to ours have to accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong made a comment in relation to manufacturing generally. Those opposite have finally worked out that Australian manufacturing workers are not paid exorbitant rates; that in the United States, Europe, Japan and some other places in the world, comparable rates in manufacturing and some other areas are well in front of what Australian workers receive. I only saw that briefly today in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, which pointed out in addition that there are countries in Asia where, for some comparable classifications, wage rates are higher than in Australia. Indeed, there is a lot of evidence now that indicates that the argument from the other side is rather poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will only continue to strengthen the direction in which Australia has been going in making its labor market more flexible. The sacrifices made by Australian workers over the last ten to twelve years have been enormous. I do not think that that has been understood by the other side of the House at all. There has been a 10 per cent reduction in the real costs of labour since about 1983. In my own state of Tasmania, the restructuring in most of the major industries that has replaced workers with machines has been enormous. Most of those companies have done that through negotiation and enterprise bargaining with their work force. There was one company that did not&mdash;APPM at its mill at Burnie. Egged on by the other side of the House&mdash;including the honourable member for Bennelong&mdash;the company went down the track of saying, `We own the capital and the workers will do what we tell them'. That was the philosophy undertaken by that company. The workers were not going to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of having decent negotiations, instead of looking at itself as a company that had not restructured over the years but needed to, instead of having labour and capital going down the one road, that company went down a road of bitterness and struggle which divided the town then and continues to do so. I hope that Amcor, the new manager of the APPM plants, will show&mdash;I am sure it will&mdash;the same progressive, modern management that it has shown in its Victorian plants where it has restructured through agreement with unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention the Tasmanian Liberal government's position on industrial relations and its move to enterprise bargaining. It changed the state industrial acts and went down the same road as that advocated by the honourable member for Bennelong. The first case involved a firm called Delta Hydraulics. The company is headed by a Mr White, one of the leading New Right members in Tasmania. He set up a ballot in his factory. He told the workers that he would sack 20 of them if they did not sign the agreement. His argument was, `I have to reduce costs', otherwise he would have to sack so many. Most of the employees signed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were several union members in that factory, and they took up the issue with the union. A commissioner was appointed under the act to hear the matter. The union applied to represent its members at the hearing. The union informed the commissioner that it wanted to appear on behalf of its members in an industrial matter. Under the state act the commissioner refused the members representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst feature of that case was that the union claimed duress on behalf of its members. The commissioner saw the employees, seven at a time, and sat them at a table. He talked to them. He said that he had many years experience in industrial relations, and that he could see by the men's body language that they were not under any duress. That caused a lot of concern to those of us who were dreading the final outcome of this act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another ballot was held without consultation with the employees. The commissioner upheld the agreement and denied the union members the right to reject it. The result was a divided work force. Employees who were not directly involved on the factory floor&mdash;office staff and others&mdash;voted in the ballot for an enterprise bargain. Those people had no overtime and shift penalties to lose&mdash;unlike the tradesmen on the floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a reduction from 10 to eight hours in the rest period between shifts. There were less travelling provisions than those contained in the award. In-laws were taken out of the bereavement list that was contained in the award. The payment of sick leave was lower than the hourly rate prescribed in the award. Overall, there was a reduction in conditions for the people working in this factory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioner asked the employer what productivity gains would be achieved by the implementation of this agreement under the state act. The first time he was asked the employer would not reply. Following a second question, the employer responded that there would be savings to the company by way of labour flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that and several other cases before that same commissioner in Tasmania, he made a public statement that the act was unfair and unjust in the sense that he believed that the act was only being used to reduce wages and conditions and had nothing to do with productivity. The state government in Tasmania has still not moved to amend the act. We accept that it was probably the original intention of the act&mdash;in line with Liberal Party policy&mdash;that if wages and conditions are reduced, economic problems are solved and some gain is made for the state. The commissioner concerned basically said that enterprise bargaining should not be used as a wage reduction process, but he had no powers to stop really bad agreements, and the state government needed to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech the honourable member for Bennelong used terms such as `union thugs', `payback time for mates', `unemployment will increase', `small business will bleed to death', and `the mob'. He seems to have a total dislike for working people and their organisations. He continues to criticise, using words of that type. His words go on and on, attacking along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this bill will provide for the flexibility to enterprise bargain in the proper manner, give bottom line support to maintaining the award structure as a safety net, and protect decent wages and conditions for the majority of Australian workers. I support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. I have to say that the 200 pages of this bill make it a little difficult to give a reasonably detailed response to all its various parts, but a number of matters strike me as very important. I notice that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has made a series of reasonably detailed responses to his own ideas over the last few months, so I suppose we can be forgiven.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lack of consistency in some parts of the industrial relations policy that has been put forward by this government over the last few years. One, which I suppose is not the most important but which absolutely stands out, is the fact that not long ago we were requiring the minimum numbers for a union to be moved up towards a figure of 10,000. All of a sudden we have had a complete change of direction&mdash;what marvellous consistency!&mdash;and that figure has come down to 100. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has consistently espoused the decentralising of industrial relations arrangements, but has then gone about deliberately centralising the administration of those arrangements. Business itself, big and small, has been going about the process of decentralising the decision-making, the operation and the administration. One particular avenue of doing that is the removal of large numbers of middle management in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that strikes me is the rather pathetic reliance on the conventions and arrangements of everyone else in the world, when in fact I would have thought that our maturity was sufficient so that we could rely on our own abilities. It is not only a reliance on other people's treaties and obligations, and the ones that we have signed with them, but a selective reliance upon those treaties. In a general sense, I think this country is becoming far too reliant on the treaties that other people make and which we sign with them. Surely if this government feels that we have to assert ourselves by starting the push for an Irish republic, then we must have enough self-confidence in our behavioural patterns and not involve ourselves in all sorts of ILO conventions that we could quite easily deal with ourselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, the reliance in this bill is on certain selected treaty obligations. I notice that some of the treaty obligations have not been selected. One in particular is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 20 of that declaration says that everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. I could not agree more. But part 2 says that no-one may be compelled to belong to an association. I can only recommend to the government that perhaps if it took a little more notice of some voluntarism in the membership of some of their organisations, it might have more members. But still, and I refer to the contribution of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), there is this great urge in the Labor Party and in the ACTU for compulsion. This bill centres itself around trying to coerce more people to get involved in the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst talking about the decentralisation of arrangements, it really does produce a system of arrangements where administration and the centralisation of industrial relations is encouraged to expand. I think it is important that we understand that what the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said about this being a payback arrangement is true. There is a very good reason for that. The reason is that trade union membership is going down although, in a funny sort of way the, if you like, unofficial membership of small organisations within enterprises is building up. In other words, people are doing deals outside the system. That was recognised, and is being recognised, by the Labor Party, the government and the ACTU. It is being recognised to the extent that now we have an operation in this bill where we are trying to put the dog around these informal arrangements that are being made all over this country to see whether we can rope them back in again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example. In my business association&mdash;not directly, but with people I know&mdash;last April, 12 months, one of my associates, not a business associate, was told by the bank that it was going to close him down. He had 10 employees and it looked as though they were in trouble. He went to the employees and they created a new arrangement&mdash;he did not go near the union. That arrangement was that they were going to get $387 a week, they were going to work for 40 hours and they would have an arrangement whereby if their productivity went up and the employer could charge out his clients at a greater number of hours, then they would get a benefit. At the beginning of that operation, the average salary was around $400 a week. There were two or three people on $420 to $430 a week. They then changed it. It worked very well. The bank was reasonably mollified. They changed that arrangement about a year later to a $430 a week minimum salary for 44 hours a week. The incentive arrangements now have at least three of the 10 employees on $570 to $630 a week. The employees are happy. They have kept their jobs, so they should be happy. The employer is happy, the bank is delighted and the business is still going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an interesting set of circumstances, but it is all illegal. That is the sort of nonsense that is going on in this country today. I could tell the House that any number of those arrangements are going on in small business&mdash;not in big business, but in small business&mdash;where people are finding that they have to make arrangements that we could not possibly think up for them. That is because they are arrangements which suit the people and suit their own particular knowledge and abilities. I think this great desire by, if you like, invoking all sorts of international conventions and by trying to rope the thing back to a more centralised arrangement is going to fail. It is going to fail just as easily as did the direction before to go to giant unions. It was an aberration which was so laughable that nobody took it seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to re-raise the subject of compulsory unionism and coercion. I have had a little experience with unions over the years and I find that many of them are absolutely marvellous supporters of their people. But some go over the top. Some of those people have used all sorts of compulsion&mdash;from force and undue picketing to arrangements which are nothing less than beyond the pale. I am delighted to see that in this country of recent times&mdash;probably due to a number of circumstances: the first reason being the straitened economic times, the second reason being that people are getting a little more sense, and the third sad reason, I suppose, is that we have an unemployment rate at around 11 per cent&mdash;the sort of coercion that was going on has started to disappear. I also think that there is a further reason for that: the unions are not strong enough to do it anymore. There are one or two unions around. The TFF try it on every now and then. I get a number of members in my electorate and from nearby electorates ringing me and saying that they are under pressure from this union or that union to join up or otherwise they will not be serviced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is important is that there are proper legal systems in the proper courts for dealing with those things. We now have enough experience to know that those sorts of bluffs can be called. That leads me simply to say that whilst the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyons, said that the honourable member for Bennelong used all sorts of words that were, perhaps, unfortunate and pointed to a certain frame of mind, the fact of the matter is that it still goes on and it is time it stopped. I am not saying that some employers are not just as tough, but it is time that those sorts of arrangements were finished in this country so that we can get back to competitive arrangements where people survive on merit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the subject of the unions within enterprises. I am absolutely sure in my mind that there are many more unionists in this country now than the official figures show. Some will be trade unionists but the others will be members of enterprise arrangements within companies. Whether they have small memberships or large memberships, they should be free to make arrangements exactly the way they like without having any benefit for being registered, unregistered or anything else; in other words, there should be no benefit for those people who happen to belong, or feel that they should belong, to the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to those parts of the bill which deal with secondary boycotts. I note that access to common law remedies would be through the commission. Everybody in business knows that a secondary boycott can do enormous damage extremely quickly. A picket or a restrictive arrangement by a union, which has an effect on a third party or someone else, can damage very quickly. Many people who have been involved in those circumstances know that the last place where they want to battle the matter out is in the Industrial Relations Commission. That is why in 1977 the industrial relations arrangements were changed and sections 45D and 45E, in particular, were brought into the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the first really effective operation that I can remember of sections 45D and 45E was in 1978 when there was a dispute in Adelaide and Perth called the live sheep dispute. An interim injunction was provided by the Federal Court reasonably quickly in those days, which prevented a picket which wanted a total ban on the export of live sheep. I suppose this was a motivation for the government. I would not be surprised if that interim injunction were still in place because, as I remember, it was one which prevented people from interfering with the export of live animals by sea, or words to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the government have changed the game from where it is fair&mdash;that is, in the proper court&mdash;and, at least in the first instance, are going to filter it through the Industrial Relations Commission. I congratulate the government for doing it in its own interests or the interests of the ACTU, because it is simply a form of getting the game back onto its field and not onto a totally independent field. I congratulate it for its success in trying to favour itself, but I do not congratulate it for what it will do to Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite are saying that these sorts of matters cannot be properly handled straightaway by an independent court which, by definition, has shown itself in this country to be even-handed, there can be no other reason for wanting to filter the matter through the Industrial Relations Commission where such matters as contempt never occur. In the proper courts, however, people can quite quickly be in trouble for contempt of court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past when people have tried to deal with these sorts of blockades, pickets, strikes, or whatever they are, that affect third parties, business people and the business of that second institution, if you like, there were a number of ways of dealing with it. Many years ago people either gave up, used some force or used some other strategy. In the late 1970s the government decided that the best and fairest way to deal with it was in the proper courts. I want somebody opposite to explain to me why we have to go back through the Industrial Relations Commission, which is a playing field that the people in the ACTU have used to their own advantage. That commission really has no sanction that is worth while. Under these new arrangements, people will have to ask permission to get to a proper court. It would be nice if the government had confidence in the independent Federal Court&mdash;that is what is really being said here: that the government does not have that confidence&mdash;to properly make a decision on these sorts of matters. The important point about independent courts such as the Federal Court is that they come to the matter fresh and not preprogrammed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great thing that is then working for people in business who are being blockaded, picketed or interrupted in their business through no fault of their own&mdash;after all, a secondary boycott is not something that they can do anything about because it is not usually a strike or picket against them, but against somebody else&mdash;is that the interim injunction can be put in place and, if the guilty parties continue, they can be up for contempt of court. But there is not any contempt of court in the IRC. I notice on occasions there is plenty of contempt for the IRC, but not much contempt of court there. It is very important that the government give some explanation&mdash;which I am sure it will not&mdash;why that needs to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, I want to re-raise this matter of unionism in Australia. Unionism is down under 40 per cent. If it were not for the public service there would be a lot fewer than that. In private business trade unionism is at 30 per cent. The way to get trade union and non-trade union membership up, which I am all for, is to make sure that the arrangements are truly democratic. Perhaps if we could have a little more democracy in the Australian workplace we might get a much better result in industrial relations, and less coercion and centralisation will produce a much better result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993, I feel it is necessary to revisit a little of Australia's industrial relations history in terms of landmark decisions. Before I list some of them, I might add that the Liberals and the Nationals or their forebears had very little to do with any of the industrial relations advances. It has been, and always will be, the labour movement and its political arm&mdash;the Australian Labor Party&mdash;which are always at the forefront, forcing the agenda, and delivering advances for working Australians. The conservative record is notable by its opposition to almost all of these advances in industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to note the Fahey government's act of perfidy in relation to Paul Matters and Neville Hilton, now facing charges for watching and besetting a picket. It is a pity that the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) has left the House, because he was speaking at some length about pickets. Watching and besetting comes under the criminal code in a 1927 act, and it is used almost exclusively in domestic violence orders. These people, who were at an authorised union picket that took place at Bombo quarry, have now been charged. The maximum sentence for conviction on this charge is six months gaol or a $500 fine. On estimate, Mr Fahey has spent well over $25,000 so far to put Mr Matters and Mr Hilton through the court system, and they will lose. These actions have taken these people through the criminal codes. It is exactly what the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was all about. He made statements on aspects of his legislation before the last election, but he was really about dealing with unions and industrial relations as though those people were criminals for standing up and speaking for their rights. This was a non-violent picket, opposed by the conservatives. Now the people of New South Wales are being forced to bankroll Mr Fahey's outrageous behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would like to go through some of the milestones in Australian labour conditions. The 1880s were the period when some of the current Australian unions were formed&mdash;for example, the waterside workers. Eighteen-ninety saw the maritime strike which is looked upon by our side of parliament as the watershed of much of the current thinking in Labor politics over the last century. Eighteen-ninety-one saw the Queensland shearers strike and the formation of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's constitution was written in 1901, with sections 51 and 34 providing for the resolution of interstate industrial disputes through conciliation and arbitration. In 1904 the Commonwealth court of conciliation and arbitration was formed&mdash;a world first. The concept of conciliation and arbitration in our constitution came directly from that maritime strike and the shearers strike and the desire of Australian workers not to be treated as dogs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1907, we saw the Harvester judgment re the Excise Tariff Act. Mr Justice Higgins introduced the concept of a `living wage', based on a male employee supporting a family of three&mdash;a new standard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1947, the New South Wales government legislated for the 40-hour week&mdash;by the way, all of these measures were introduced by Labor governments&mdash;and in 1948 the Commonwealth court followed with the 40-hour week. In the 1960s, four weeks annual leave became a standard through state governments.

In 1970, annual leave loading was negotiated in the waterfront industry, flowing mainly from state awards and decisions across the work force. In 1972, we saw the second equal pay case; in 1974, the third equal pay case; and in 1978&mdash;by God, listen to this&mdash;the maternity leave test case was run before the commission and accepted.

In 1986, we saw the introduction of the Affirmative Action (Equal Opportunity for Women) Act. The arbitration commission accepted the concept of award provisions to require the employer to contribute to the employee's superannuation. In 1990, paternity leave was accepted by the commission&mdash;52 weeks unpaid leave. In 1991, the Occupation Health and Safety Act was passed for Commonwealth employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would challenge the honourable member for Bennelong to deny that industrial disputation under this government has been 62 per cent lower than under the Fraser government in which he was the brains of the outfit. On top of this achievement in industrial harmony, the unions have dramatically restructured, awards have been substantially restructured, and a consistent and equitable framework of minimum award rates has been established through the minimum rates adjustment process&mdash;all of which have significantly contributed to micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are constantly given a frightened ostrich's view of industrial relations by the coalition. Let me state clearly for those on the other side: look at the history; look at the broad view; look at the magnificent record this country has in its short history compared to any other country in the world. That is predominantly due to the labour movement in this country and the political arm of that labour movement, the great Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it would be appropriate to elucidate the definition of industrial relations for the benefit of those on the other side of this chamber. Industrial relations is the form and procedures engaged in by parties engaged in productive activities to determine the terms and conditions under which those activities proceed, the agreement of capital with labour for their mutual relations. While this may seem self-evident, it has apparently escaped the mental capabilities of the opposition, especially the honourable member for Bennelong. Let me point out to the honourable member for Bennelong that industrial relations is not defined as the rules that allow capital to dictate to labour the terms of its slavery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us revisit in brief the honourable member for Bennelong's position at the last election. What essential features would Australian workers have had imposed upon them had the honourable member for Bennelong and his mates gained office? From my point of view, the essence of the honourable member's position was that unions had to be killed. And with some vague assertions about individual rights, he maintained that, on their own, individual workers would be able to negotiate equally with multinational corporations, companies with monopoly control of employment in small communities, as well as the significant government employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imputation was that, without the help of unions and the collective bargaining position that unions afford their workers, individuals&mdash;irrespective of age, gender, ethnic background, personal intellectual ability or indeed the ability to research and collate the complexities of industrial relations&mdash;would miraculously obtain the skills of an industrial barrister, an occupational health and safety officer, an economic planner, a health scientist, a counsellor, an industrial negotiator, a political analyst and a communicator of high standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the honourable member for Bennelong does not believe that this is possible. Therefore, his second imputation was that the representatives of capital and government representing the Australian employers are an angelic group of philanthropists whose sole purpose is the betterment of the conditions of all Australian workers. To verify this, one only has to recall his assertions that no Australian workers would be worse off under his unscrupulous proposals. Indeed, his outrageous claim was that most Australian workers would be better off. Clearly, these assertions question the judgment and sanity of anyone loopy enough to impute such nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the honourable member for Bennelong to come clean and state the reality of his intentions, which I maintain would mean the destruction of the union movement so that the Australian work force would be left defenceless against the greedy, the unscrupulous, the standover merchants and the criminals, and the ugly face of Australian employers. Mr Deputy Speaker, consider this: if you were a caring employer aware of the honourable member's propositions and you saw your competitive position being undermined by those who represent the ugly face of Australian business&mdash;and let us name them: the Peko-Wallsend elements&mdash;in their industrial relations with their work force, would you not be forced against your altruistic judgments to take the same road to protect your competitive position? Would you not have to alter your bottom line to continue in business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So is it not true that the honourable member for Bennelong and the coalition were all about lowering real wages for non-management workers in Australia? And for what purpose? To improve Australia? No. The real purpose was to redistribute income away from the majority of Australians for the benefit of their corporate mates. The coalition often talks about our union mateship and pay-offs. The coalition's intent was to force good employers to impoverish ordinary Australians in order to pay back the corporate backers of the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia who kicked the can heavily to fund their election expenses in the election that they could not lose but did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intent, stated and unstated, was to eliminate the ability of Australians to have a secure social security system, particularly in the unemployment benefits area. Those opposite hoped that, faced with starvation and the inability to provide for families, Australian workers would be forced to accept anything that employers were prepared to offer. This was the most un-Australian, unpatriotic position conceivable for those who believe&mdash;as I do&mdash;that Australia is the people who inhabit this continent. To act against the interests of the vast majority of Australians is to attack Australia&mdash;and is thus unpatriotic. It is a lot of other things, but the constraint of polite language and the rules of this House prevent my calling them what they deserve to be called for their intent to perform an act of perfidy against the vast majority of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, this bill, although not warmly embraced by the full family of unions and Australian workers, is a sincere attempt to adjust the Australian industrial relations environment to a changing, competitive world. It acknowledges that industrial relations is a marriage of two interests and that, as in all marriages, there needs to be an ability to compromise and reach consensus for the productive relationship to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This act will enhance the accord's partners&mdash;unions and the government&mdash;and the ability to promote true enterprise bargaining, not some outrageous circumstance in which the boss takes all and dictates all. The award system is built as a safety net for all workers, whether or not they are unionists. It will be enhanced by the minimum entitlements legislation, based on the ILO conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation includes and strengthens the provision of equal pay for equal work, translated for the honourable member for Bennelong and for those opposite who do not care as equal pay for men and women for work of equal value. Workers will also be protected from unfair dismissal. It also strengthens the termination, change and redundancy test case. The honourable member for Bennelong wants to have workers in such a position that if a boss gives a 50 per cent cut in pay and the worker objects he or she is out the door. The legislation will also provide for unpaid parental leave, recognising the role men play in family life and care of their children in addition to the role played by women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flexibility clauses enable enterprises and workplaces to vary the general conditions of awards to suit particular needs. These must be ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission and&mdash;quite rightly&mdash;unions have the right and duty to be heard on that. The commission will maintain and update the award safety net. Minimum entitlements will be applied and it will conciliate in enterprise agreements. It will also supervise the no disadvantage clause guaranteeing the protection of workers against wage cuts and the disintegration of accepted standards. It can also ensure bargaining in good faith. I would have wished sections 45D and 45E to have been abolished completely. I will get to that in a minute. The industrial relations court will be established. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is basically a big payback for the ACTU and the manner in which it conducted itself during the last election&mdash;and for the spending of some $30 million. It is not only a payback but a backdown by the government from its initial position before the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) attended the conference in Melbourne. That has been well highlighted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a massive backdown. There was a lot to be commended in the new and enlightened opinions of the government as it came out of the last election. But all that enlightenment has been stomped well and truly&mdash;and forever. The package has been described as a partnership between the government and the ACTU, a party to the accord. There are no other partners. Some who might have enjoyed some assistance were from the employer organisations and the non-Labor states. But that is not to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well recall in my own state of Queensland that once the Labor government was elected the first thing it did was repeal the voluntary employment agreements which had been wildly hailed throughout the state, and I believe beyond it, as being a measure by which people in a workplace were prepared to come together and voluntarily agree to award provisions in return for productivity. Probably the best known example of that was Power Brewing. I believe the relationship between the employers and employees was such that when the voluntary employment agreements were taken away from the employees the whole of that work force, which amounted to some 400 people, decided that in spite of union intervention they would proceed in the way that they were already going. I believe it is a great pity that in my own state of Queensland this is not one of the matters that we can look back on with some pride. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably one of the greatest offences of this bill is that yet again the government is seeking its powers externally, not from within Australia itself. When we look at the circumvention that will once again occur to overrule the state bodies&mdash;and I believe that there is very much a predetermination by the government to do this as far as Victoria is concerned&mdash;it is the external powers that will provide the facility for that circumvention. Those external powers are being used more and more by this government. One wonders whether the people who cry about the new world order do not really have something to complain about in that the power for Australians to legislate for themselves, it seems, is being transhipped to other places. I mention the Franklin Dam and the rainforests of North Queensland as examples of those powers being used to overrule the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem with this legislation is that it walks away from common law remedies. I think that is a great pity. We hail many decisions that have been made by the High Court, in the name of common law, as being great decisions. Yet the most fundamental factor of common law is a contract that a person can make, one with another, and the manner in which common law reinforces that contract. This area is to be transferred to the Industrial Relations Act. I believe that is most inappropriate. So too are the anti-boycott provisions, on which some fundamental decisions have been made and which have been to a large extent a disciplinary factor that the unions have kept in mind before conducting some of the more outrageous ambit claims and strike actions that have taken place. Two examples of that which come to mind are the Mudginberri dispute and the Dollar Sweets dispute in Victoria. If it had not been for those protections within common law, goodness knows where those strikes might have gone. The Labor Party intends to transfer this matter to the Industrial Relations Act. If it could, it would try to get rid of it altogether. As I said before, the bill reinforces the award system with International Labour Organisation conventions and new minimum conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reform bill overlooks completely the one fundamental need in Australia to bring us back on the rails: a system that will create more and therefore fuller employment. In Australia today the official figure for unemployment is 11.3 per cent. If honourable members care to look at the unofficial figure&mdash;including those people who are on minimal conditions, on casual rates and in part-time employment&mdash;I believe it can safely be said that it is 20 per cent, not 11.3 per cent. The bill overlooks altogether the capacity of business in Australia to create employment and get us out of this mess. As I said before, it is nothing more than a payback to the ACTU. Labor unions and Labor governments, in their own time, are trying to take more and give less. They are the ones that have created this unemployment, and particularly the unemployment caused by the loss of existing jobs. Yet this situation will persevere because the reform package gives no hope, encouragement or incentive to small or big business. I think that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only employment opportunities that are offered in Australia today are within the public services of the Commonwealth and the states. Those people engaged in training or who are attending educational facilities to acquire skills will still be on the unemployment list. So no real jobs are being created; incentives are needed to encourage small and large businesses to acquire greater productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see that labour related taxes are paid by small and big business alike. I start with the superannuation levy. Five per cent of the payroll is being paid for doubtful superannuation and savings in the future&mdash;savings that are being lost for use in current conditions and for current spending. That is a huge burden on business. The fringe benefits tax&mdash;probably the most offensive tax that this government has ever introduced&mdash;is a tax on employment; it is a tax on fringe benefits and is paid by employers and not employees. The payroll tax&mdash;a temporary measure brought in over 50 years ago by the states&mdash;still exists as a major impediment to employment. I know that some workplaces have a scale of employment which will keep them under the ceiling at which they would have to pay tax. That is a deliberate policy. The training levy, the health and safety levy, penalty rates and workers compensation all stop businesses from employing, from being as productive as they might be and from expanding. As I said, there appears to be no relief in this legislation; once again it will reinforce union monopoly and control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it has been said in this House&mdash;and it is a known fact throughout Australia&mdash;that there is a decrease in membership of unions, this particular piece of legislation in reference to private contracts or enterprise agreements lets the unions play a de facto part of the negotiations. When a non-union work force tries for some improvement in an enterprise agreement, there is no doubt that the de facto negotiators from the union will represent that work force in order to create pressure such that the productivity sought by both employer and employee will not be able to be gained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industrial relations reform bill goes nowhere near providing relief from those pressures and labour costs that I have just mentioned. The enterprise agreements are a far cry from the voluntary employment contracts that the Queensland government once had. While enterprise agreements can be applied in non-union workplaces, the union will still be involved and have the power to intervene and spoil what I believe was meant to be a workable system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention in passing the situation that exists in the sugar industry at the moment and the means by which all employees&mdash;field employees and mill employees&mdash;are compelled by an agreement between the peak bodies, the Queensland Cane Growers Council and the AWU, to have membership. The manner in which it is done is that an employer of any field worker&mdash;any person working on a harvesting or planting contract or involved with anything on that farm&mdash;who does not insist by 30 September each year that that individual worker be covered by an AWU ticket is boycotted from the supply of cane trucks for transport of the sugar cane. That is quite deliberate. Can anybody tell me that, in a situation such as that, unionism is other than compulsory and that there is any way out for the farmer apart from sticking to his principles and having his cane left in the field? The wretched part of that is probably that the peak body, the Australian Cane Farmers Association, is party to that agreement. Boycotting in those circumstances is without parallel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year, the combined mills of the Mackay Sugar Cooperative&mdash;some four sugar mills altogether&mdash;in the interests of productivity and keeping people employed, have arranged to transfer cane from one mill to another to crush the sugar cane. There were three days of strike at a time rather critical to the industry when the AWU called out its members so that certain of those mills stopped. To the credit of the employees of one of the sugar mills, they said, `No, we will not stop production', and they kept going. It was only when the commissioner told the AWU not to be so bloody-minded and stupid and to let its members go back to work that the strike eventually finished. These are just two examples that have happened within this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see that the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) is here, because, in a recent debate in this House in connection with South Sea Islanders, he said that the AWU did not have a proud record within the sugar industry because the AWU had insisted on a white Australia policy within the cane fields. He was quite right. South Sea Islanders were not allowed to register as members of the union. They were not allowed to work on those premises. As a result of that, South Sea Islanders worked at night by the light of the moon to do the work that was necessary in order to avoid that situation. The sugar industry, with the AWU within it, does not have a very proud history. I note that the brother of the honourable member for Reid is the President of the ACTU, but I thank him very much for the analogy I just gave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does not call on unions to be accountable. Here we have a Commonwealth piece of legislation&mdash;the same Commonwealth which legislates that corporate companies and people be accountable for taxation returns and everything else&mdash;which has nothing in it that calls upon a union to present a proper set of accounts as would be set out by any other registered organisation or company in Australia. I have not seen any balance sheets of late but I recall that about six or seven years ago I found that the balance sheet of a particularly big union was written on just one sheet of foolscap paper. Any statutory organisation in Australia today has to have its balance sheet qualified to a larger extent and in more detail. Yet we have here a situation where a union is not accountable to its members. Members of unions are asked to pay their fees. That is fair enough, but a lot are also asked to pay a levy to be used by that union for matters other than trade union work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask: how much did the trade union movement fund the Labor Party in the last election? I know that, within my electorate, teachers, nurses and transport unions&mdash;the whole lot of them&mdash;provided money, and material was being issued all in the interests of the Labor Party. It is interesting now that those same teachers are complaining in Queensland because they think they are getting a raw deal from their state Labor government&mdash;the same government as they funded. The nurses are also up in arms. In relation to transport unions, it is particularly relevant that there have been threats against railway employees about taking up the lines in some areas, and this is all part of a system that they funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final thing I want to talk about as far as fairness and equity are concerned is the privileged tax position that unions in Australia enjoy over any of their comparable company structures. They enjoy a tax exemption for any income they earn. I think it is under section 27 of the act. As a result, unions are able to amass quite a lot of funds to be used in ways in which the members would not want them to be used. It is another example of the manner in which this government will bend over backwards to accommodate the ACTU. As I said, the original program the government put to the ACTU is, as I understand it, a far cry from what we have here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those special privileged positions that unions enjoy under this government are not enjoyed by any other Australians. I refer again to the taxation exemption at a time when we are trying to deal with the taxation issue within our electorates. I imagine that all members of the House of Representatives know that pensioners and veterans are being persecuted as a result of the income testing of the value of their shares from one period to another, which is a scandalous situation. We see them persecuted. We see the loss of income as a result and loss of the pension as a result. Yet the union movement is able to escape the liability of taxation as would be applicable in any other case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation offers nothing to increase Australia's exports. It does nothing to increase the viability and expansion of Australian business. But it means a lot as far as a reward and a backdown to the ACTU by this government is concerned, which is not unusual in the circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contributions of those opposite in this debate on the Industrial Relations Reform Bill have been quite interesting. Perhaps the last speaker, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), more clearly than anyone else, drove home the antipathy towards the trade union movement. Opposition members are preoccupied with the taxation advantages of the trade union movement. It is a matter which those opposite do not often show much interest in. The recent performance of their leadership contender puts those kinds of comments into context. However, one of the more impressive contributions came from the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) who stressed his moderation, his membership of a trade union and his discussions with a previous minister in a Labor government. He went on to praise some of the comments made by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) and to urge moderation and sanity in these kinds of debates.</PARA></TALK.START>

For instance, we had&mdash;as we always do in these industrial relations debates&mdash;the contribution of the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). Whenever he speaks in industrial relation debates, we are reminded of the segregationalist governor of Alabama, George Wallace. After having been beaten in an election, he said that he was never going to be out-niggered again. There is no doubt that no-one on the opposite side is going to outdo the honourable member for La Trobe in his extremism in the industrial relations debate. We had a situation where the opposition lead spokesman on this matter, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), came up with a figure of eight hurdles introduced by this government for those who wanted to get involved in enterprise bargains. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) went up-market a bit more and he contended there were 13. But, as usual, the honourable member for La Trobe produced 16 supposed barriers. </PARA>

There was this general proposition that these particular changes in regard to enterprise bargaining in this country are simply a payback&mdash;total, end of story.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last federal election campaign the shadow industrial relations spokesman, the honourable member for Bennelong, was not too prominent for fairly obvious reasons: he was a very articulate representative of a point of view which really proved very unpopular with the Australian electorate. This was indicated by the former member for Bass who, after his defeat, commented that the main reason he lost his seat was the way in which the Labor Party drove home effectively the question of the youth wage throughout that campaign. He said that he could basically walk up and convince people individually, one-to-one, on the issue, but everywhere he went in his electorate he was confronted by people who hit him with this youth wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are really seeing here an unwillingness by those opposite to accept that. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) might have tried to make industrial relations a lesser issue in the campaign. Certainly the government went out and fought this particular issue every day of the campaign in every electorate around this country. It might be worrying to members of the opposition that the kinds of attitudes that they put forward were rejected, and were rejected pretty thoroughly. It is even more telling when we look at the popularity of the union movement in this country. It is so low with the average elector and the average person, for a variety of reasons. The opposition has been fundamentally rejected because of the extremism of its industrial relations views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come in here today and say that it is a payback to the union movement is really putting it a bit simply. There has been great debate within the party on the matter. Some people have been perceived by a majority of members of their caucus as going too far out in suggesting changes. Obviously there is a close relationship between people who are members of trade unions and Australian politics. There is still an association between people in some occupations and their voting preferences. The opposition shadow spokesman came here today and said there has been some deal and that anything Jennie George says is of biblical significance because in some debate with Brian Noakes or Ian Spicer she said or whispered in their ears, `We won the election and we are getting paid back'. All of a sudden whatever Jennie George says is of biblical significance, according to the honourable member for Bennelong. Obviously that is not the case. It is part of a deeper picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an attitude on this side of the House that, although enterprise bargaining in this country should be opened up, it should be with a degree of protection. In talking about protection, there is the other thrust of the opposition's position. There is a bit of a worry about conspiracy theories. Those opposite are constantly trying to drive home this supposed undermining of Australian sovereignty, that through our process, because we actually have a government that has ratified certain conventions&mdash;not just those of the ILO but from a variety of international organisations&mdash;somehow our authority, our sovereignty, is undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a conscious decision of the elected government of this country. The government is not compelled to ratify every convention. It has made a decision that in these particular areas those conventions are worth while; they have something worth while for the Australian population. Of course, that is central to the attitude of the government to these matters. Whilst people should move towards enterprise bargaining, whilst there should be an involvement by the work force with the employer&mdash;an attempt to see what a particular enterprise requires in order to get rid of practices that are undermining its operation&mdash;at the same time there should be some fundamental protections for the workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to one area that caused concern&mdash;a protection the government has introduced in this legislation&mdash;and that is the question of equal pay. Regarded as one of the dreadful actions of this government is its attempt to bring in certain minimums in regard to equal pay. I refer to an article by Karen Fredericks in the spring edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Refractory Girl</EMPHASIS>. I would not agree with her actual analysis of the government's policy when she said that we had introduced `an industrial strategy which could have been stolen wholesale from the Liberals' Fightback package'. That is certainly nothing the opposition would agree with. However, she made some very important points about the reality of women's wages. When we look at those under awards in this country we see that female wages are 93 per cent of male wages. When we go to the broader issue of average weekly earnings, we find they are only 66 1/2 per cent. There is a variety of reasons for that: the concentration of areas they work in, the nature of those industries, et cetera. It is relevant&mdash;it is not totally because of the industries they work in&mdash;that they also receive only 20 per cent of male overtime earnings. We have to consider that in the context of her statement where she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian workforce remains the most sex segregated of all OECD countries, with women concentrated in the weakest, least strategically important, most geographically diverse and lowest value added areas of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst those are ingredients of the total picture, the reality is that the award structure in this country has provided a degree of wage protection for females. This is why there has been extensive opposition to the drift down the enterprise bargaining way by women's groups in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason this government has fundamentally chosen to go to enterprise bargaining is so that things like parental leave, equal pay, the right to avoid unfair dismissal and the right to fight it can be guarded against and protected. The problem can perhaps be summarised in a quote from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on this very question of women's wages when it said in April 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot predict the extent of the disadvantage female workers will experience if the Commonwealth gives its approval of a scheme of enterprise bargaining. We do accept, however that enterprise bargaining&mdash;especially for over award payments&mdash;places at a relative disadvantage those sections of the workforce where women predominate.</PARA>
<PARA>Even the commission saw a very serious threat to women's conditions in this country by an uncontrolled drift towards enterprise bargaining. So the government has tried to ensure&mdash;not because a few trade union officials said we should do it but because it is a concrete problem out there&mdash;these minimum protections by legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, there is a variety of things that the government has quite rightly sought to do something about. They cover, in addition to the matters I cited earlier, redundancy payments, equal pay and the ability and rights of people to conduct industrial action. In regard to redundancies, we have legislated to provide people with varying lengths of service with some warning or advice from the employer. This is attacked by a few people opposite as a bit of an impediment or a bit of a problem because when a lot of people are sacked the CES has to be told and it is the end of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the average person in this country would find it a reasonable requirement that people facing redundancy should be consulted and warned&mdash;remembering that that is only in the case of 15 or more. Regarding parental leave, it is not a conspiracy by some Zionist type collection of people or some group of dictators to force unreasonable and unparalleled restrictions on us. It is simply saying that a husband and wife should have unpaid leave during a period of 12 months with conditions of notification, et cetera, attached to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that too many people are overly worried about the claim by those opposite that this is simply paying back a few union leaders for a supposed $30 million. The question of section 45D and 45E is also involved. Once again, there has been a very long campaign by the rank and file of our party to get rid of it. It has been raised at local branches, at our federal electorate councils, or FEAs, around Australia. This has involved the actual rank and file of our party&mdash;not just a few trade union heavies. It is the people who bother to go to the monthly meetings who have continued to press this government on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attempts were made in 1984 and 1987, and failed. This has not come out of left field, from some kind of cabal meeting after the last federal election. It is a measure of the degree of dissatisfaction with and opposition to the way people's legitimate trade union actions were voted for by members of their particular unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the opposition is concerned, this is very dire situation because it is based on a reference to an ILO convention. Whilst there have been attempts by our party to change this measure, ILO convention 87, which we ratified back in 1973, finds it to be an impediment to union action. There have been three critical reports in the interim about its effectiveness on people's rights to exercise industrial action in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one is saying that every time someone says we are contravening a human rights convention&mdash;saying, for example, that we cannot incarcerate boat people&mdash;or when someone in Geneva says this or that, that we have to follow every stricture. But what has been decided here is that the government of Australia did ratify this measure; it did decide that it was worthwhile and worth implementing. The experts from the ILO have concluded that the current legislation restricts people's rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a number of exceptions in the area of secondary boycotts, and we will see primary boycotts and restrictions on them disappear. In regard to secondary boycotts the pecuniary penalty of $250,000 will disappear. There will also be&mdash;this is apparently very abhorrent too&mdash;a pre-litigation period in an attempt to conciliate and overcome disputes by discussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On occasion some small businesses could be hurt by this. That is a realistic concern. The so-called club, which is another evil organisation&mdash;the club of practitioners on both sides of the fence; people who have actually been involved in industrial disputes&mdash;are apparently to be condemned forever because of their actual involvement in this field. On the other hand, the supposed experts here, in most cases, have had no involvement at all. The people in that club often feel that going to court and seeking penalties, seeking to impose orders on people in a non-industrial tribunal, actually hardens attitudes, worsens disputes, and precipitates worse problems on the site. Once again, this is an area where there is very strong support within the government for change. There is also a view among most people in the Liberal Party that this legislation is long overdue; that the present practice is restrictive, undermines people's rights and should go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of secondary boycotts will be allowed where there is a clear connection between the people involved in the original dispute on the site&mdash;that is, where their rights and those of other people and companies are interconnected. Litigation restrictions will not apply to disputes where it is found that there is a fundamental threat to sectors of the economy or where it is found that there is, say, a question of damage to property. That kind of slate cleaning will not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few years there has been a drift towards enterprise bargaining in this country. What we are seeing here are not only the protections implemented because of international conventions but also a variety of site requirements. The fact that the trade unions might have the right to be heard, even where they do not have members, causes fulminations from those opposite. The reality is that what occurs on sites where there are no union members can undermine the conditions of the union members throughout the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think most of us would find it easy to defend the notion that it is important for unions to have an input into the process. It is important for unions be able to represent their membership on those sites where they have membership and for there to be protection for those people who fail to come to an agreement with their employer with regard to sites. There will be provision for protection from inducements to leave the trade unions. In total, it is not a retreat from enterprise bargaining; it is an attempt to ensure that, when it does occur, female wages will be protected and people will not have their overall wage packet undermined. </PARA>

According to an Australian Bureau of Statistics paper released in February 1993, trade union membership has declined in this country by six percentage points to 40 per cent of employees. I quote from a report of a survey covering the period 1986 to 1992:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Falls in membership rates were recorded in all industries except for Public administration and defence (which was relatively unchanged over the six year period).

<PARA>The cosy rhetoric from the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) has little substance. To the contrary, this bill is not about&mdash;and I quote&mdash;`a more productive and competitive nature'. It does not lead to the generation of more jobs in the future. I do not believe that we can support the honourable member's belief that the Australian Labor Party's commitment to a fair and just system of industrial relations will emanate from this bill. As I said, his rhetoric has little substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was right when he said yesterday in his speech that this bill is a payback and a convenient deal to revitalise the union movement in Australia. I can appreciate that. I have come from business and I know what it is like. I know that we all have to work hard to maintain our positions. That is understandable. I also understand that unionism is big business in this country today and there is big money involved. I acknowledge that the unions have a part to play. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) may find that a little strange, but that is true. I believe&mdash;and I am sure my colleagues support my belief&mdash;that unionism has a very major part to play in Australian industrial relations today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us face what Australian businesses have to face everyday: giving the customer good service; working in the customer's interest; learning to stand squarely on their own feet; and, competing for their market share. There is an important role for unions if they would only emerge from their troglodyte mentality and see that this country can and will prosper with sensible industrial relations that protects the interest of all parties. It is a partnership. It is something that we have to encourage all parties to work together on. We must give up the old aggressive way&mdash;beating them over the head with a piece of four-by-two&mdash;and start seeing what is happening between employers and employees in 1993. We very often look but do not see; we listen, but we do not hear. I am afraid that that is the case here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs an industrial relations system giving greater flexibility to employees and employers to decide terms of employment, but backed by the rule of law providing certainty and due process when industrial power is misused. This Labor government brings forward a bill to reverse these priorities. On the one side, it intrudes the dead hand of unions to enterprise agreements that do not involve unionised workers. On the other, we see a sinister diminution of the legal safeguards of employers against the misuse of union power through the transfer of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act to the Industrial Relations Act, and so into the treacly world of the industrial relations club, which I heard the honourable member for Reid talk about in his speech just a few minutes ago. I would also like to think that we could move away from these cosy definitions, but it takes two to tango. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the government pursues its centralising agenda through the selective use of international conventions upholding the rights of unionists while ignoring article 20 of the United Nations Charter on Human Rights that declares that no-one may be compelled to belong to an association. This is a retrogressive bill, seeking to restrict enterprise bargaining and ensure that unions engaging in secondary boycotts will evade the full and proper force of the law. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) clutches at the mantle of Alfred Deakin to legitimise the bill's surrender to the vested interests of the ACTU. Students of history will know that the essence of Deakin's legacy was an open and empirical approach that would adapt to changing circumstances. We can beg to differ whether today Deakin would support the watering down of the legal rights of business as redress against intimidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a perversion of the constitution that a power expressly given to the Commonwealth for the resolution of interstate disputes has been usurped to allow interference at will with state industrial law. Taking a full historical perspective, it is a fact that the living standards of Australian workers in relation to other nations has actually declined since the early years of this century and that much of the blame is due to a regimented industrial relations system that priced Australians out of the job market once the cosy captive British markets of 1904 faded. Deakin was a reformer; this bill is not about reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill displays a crude and cynical bias in clause 170DF when it prohibits termination of an employee on the ground of his union activities, yet it gives no protection to an employee who may be dismissed or denied a job because of a principled refusal to join a union. Such an omission, conveniently ignoring the United Nations Charter on Human Rights, is a green light for unions to reverse their historic decline in the private sector work force through the intimidation of employers. This government would be glad to sanction a scenario whereby unions insist preference provisions are the price for their approval of enterprise agreements. Indeed, there is a real prospect under this bill that unions will be able to evade prohibitions on placing secondary boycotts on non-union enterprises to enforce union membership in contemplation of future claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a fundamental injustice for this legislation to give unions standing in enterprise agreements that substantially or entirely involve non-unionised employees.

They do not see why unions deserve to be invested with authority over the entire work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst aspect of this bill is its attack on the legal rights of the business sector to defend itself against secondary boycotts through the transfer of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act to the Industrial Relations Act. The minister disingenuously claimed that the government is seeking to address the majority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in its examination of this question. The minister is saying that the legislation conforms to the sanctimonious humbug contained in a report that carefully ignored the evidence submitted by employer organisations. It was a report full of weasel words deeming effective employer defence against the thuggery of secondary boycotts as `inappropriate' and creating `disharmony'. It was a report written on the premise that effective legal deterrents against the misuse of union power are illegitimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this attitude that has given us a bill put forward by a government that does not care whether businesses are sent to the wall by the actions of unions who do not represent the will of their employees. The private sector employers, who are Australia's only hope of reducing what has become structural unemployment, do not care whether they can obtain protection from industrial legislation, the common law, or trade practices legislation. It just so happens that the last of these happens to work, much to the chagrin of the ACTU. It is a simple fact that this 1977 reform of the coalition is effective because, unlike civil law, the complainant does not have to establish that the offender was aware of a breach of contract. Unlike the orders of the commission, enforcement is swift. This action belongs in the real world, the world of enforceable damages and not to the polite shadow boxing of the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a dubious principle to separate anti-competitive actions by unions from those of businesses.

That was precisely the attitude rejected by the 1976 Swanson committee when it recommended reform of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP will never provide Australia with leadership so long as the determinant of its industrial relations policy is the satisfaction of the corporate interests of unions, and not the national economic good or the upholding of justice and due process. Industrial relations cannot always be reduced to a comfortable moral relativism, aiming solely at the reconciliation of competing interests. This approach wilfully ignores those occasions where one party defies the rules and uses its intimidatory power to inflict crippling damage on what fair-minded people would regard as innocent parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these instances, union officials who deliberately impose boycotts, and who then defy due legal process, should never be immune from the legal consequences of their actions. It is, of course, no accident that the pecuniary penalty of $250,000 operating under the Trade Practices Act will not be part of the Industrial Relations Act. The minister tries the weak excuse that the penalty has never applied since 1977. Does he think we have never heard of the deterrent effect of penalties? Certainly those unions for whom industrial harmony is synonymous with employer weakness were very conscious of them and have thus successfully achieved their removal. </PARA>

It is also a matter of record just how damaging secondary boycotts can be. Operations can be stopped completely, market share lost, reputations as reliable suppliers destroyed, cash flow cut drastically, and employees of firms who were not participating in the boycotts stood down.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) has turned up; I was a bit worried. The legislative reforms to the industrial relations system contained in the Industrial Relations Reform Bill allow increased flexibility while at the same time ensure that the rights of workers are protected. It is true that earlier in the consultation process surrounding the drafting of this legislation I did express concerns at measures that would allow the non-unionist work force access to enterprise bargaining, as did a number of other members of the labour movement. That concern was expressed as a result of my experience in Queensland in the days of the Bjelke-Petersen government when we saw so-called enterprise agreements or voluntary employment agreements which were certainly anything but voluntary and which caused massive problems for the work force. But those days are long gone and the work force appreciates that. The latest poll figures show that people now believe that industrial relations is not the priority it was earlier in the year, particularly leading up to the federal election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have been satisfied that these agreements will be subject to a series of safeguards to ensure that they do not disadvantage workers. I refer specifically to the agreements that have been put forward here and negotiated by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). The decision to allow non-union access to enterprise flexibility agreements is only one element of the reforms which will maintain and strengthen the award system as a safety net and a basic benchmark for enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will also legislate national minimum standards to ensure minimum wages, equal pay, parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal. It is a credit to the hard work of the Minister for Industrial Relations that he has been able to achieve increased flexibility in our industrial relations system while at the same time maintaining the rights and conditions of Australian workers. I commend the minister on his efforts in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere was the line that divided the government and the opposition at the last election more clearly drawn than in the area of industrial relations, as we all well know. Just as the Australian people rejected the GST and the cutbacks to Medicare proposed by those opposite, they also rejected the jobsback policy of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). This Labor government has much to be proud of in the area of industrial relations policy. Dramatic changes have occurred in the Australian work force during the past decade, with the complete overhaul of the trade union structure in this country, a reform process which will rationalise the structure of the union movement and overhaul the award system; and moves towards multiskilling, just to name a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The focus of this policy is the accord, an instrument that has resulted in a wages policy that has increased both productivity and wages. Australian workers and their trade union movement have shown remarkable restraint over the past nine years, average weekly earnings having fallen by 4.3 per cent. Under the last coalition government, Australia had the seventh highest labour costs in the OECD, whereas today we are 14th. These gains have been made in cooperation with the trade union movement rather than taking the confrontationist approach adopted in Thatcher's Britain, Reagan's America or Kennett's Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already, federal government changes to the industrial relations system have seen 1,200 cooperative workplace agreements reached between employers, workers and their unions, covering 37 per cent of federal award employees. These changes have been achieved while also achieving reductions in the level of industrial disputation, with the number of disputes and the number of employees involved in disputes at their lowest level since 1961. The number of working days lost per 1,000 employees is at its lowest level since 1962, another great achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, quite contrary to the picture which those opposite try to paint of the trade union movement, the numbers of strikes are now at record low levels. They are now more than 60 per cent below the level they were when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was the economics adviser to the honourable member for Bennelong. The only states where overall levels of industrial disputation have risen in recent years are Victoria and Tasmania. The increased industrial disputation in these two states is because their conservative governments have by and large removed the safety net of awards and have moved towards the large scale introduction of a system of individual work contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industrial relations policies adopted by the Victorian and Tasmanian governments are similar to the industrial relations policies which the federal coalition attempted to introduce across Australia with its jobsback policy, which was rejected by the Australian people, and rightly so. This approach to industrial relations was comprehensively rejected by the people at the 13 March election earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was no accident that seven of the seats which the government won from the coalition in the election were in Victoria and Tasmania. Once again, the recent polls show that industrial relations is not the issue as it was before the lead-up to the federal election. People now see that this government is a responsible government when it comes to industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian approach to industrial relations, the approach which the honourable member for Bennelong wanted to introduce across Australia in the jobsback policy, is a failure. It has done nothing to make workplaces in that state more productive. Sadly, the honourable member for Bennelong and the coalition have not recognised this fact. Some people are slow learners. Those opposite really are slow learners when it comes to industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite continue to push for an industrial relations system based on individual employment contracts and where the safety net provided by the award system is taken away from Australian workers. It is essential to look at the confrontationist policies being proposed by the coalition in order to understand why this government rejects those policies and why it has chosen the new industrial relations model contained in this legislation. The honourable member for Bennelong has indicated that the only part of the jobsback policy which the coalition took to the last election that will change is the $3-an-hour youth wage; I am not sure what he would do with it. Despite this change, the coalition's policy remains a very reactionary prescription. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the coalition's industrial relations policy would mean that all workers would lose the protection of the award system and be forced into individual contracts except where their boss deigns to allow them to stay with the award. The only conditions employees would be guaranteed would be the base minimum rate of the old award, annual leave, sick leave and maternity leave. Workers would stand to lose their penalty rates, overtime rates, shift allowances, holiday loadings, award superannuation and redundancy entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another great achievement of this government has been to provide superannuation for the Australian work force so that they can prepare for their retirement. But, under the policy proposals of the honourable member for Bennelong and the rest of those opposite, there would be no limits on the number of hours worked in a day and workers would lose their public holidays, rest and meal breaks and their right to permanent employment, which could be replaced by casual employment. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the coalition's model there would be a requirement for individual employment contracts to be registered or checked by an independent body. In addition, employees coerced into unfair contracts would have no right of appeal to an independent arbitrator such as the Industrial Relations Commission. Unions would have no place in the negotiation of individual contracts, even if employees nominated them to negotiate on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant issues in Australian industrial relations are improving work practices, increasing productivity and protecting workers in a weak bargaining position relative to their employers. Unfortunately, the coalition's industrial relations policy does nothing to address these issues. All it has to offer Australian workers is the removal of the safety net provided by the Industrial Relations Commission, leaving them open to exploitation by employers who would be in a position to take away many of their basic rights and conditions. The sole aim of the opposition in industrial relations is to cut wages through the destruction of trade unions and the industrial tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating Labor government utterly rejects this divisive and confrontationist approach. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill contains the federal government's drive towards a more decentralised industrial relations system. It is designed to encourage more bargaining at the workplace and enterprise level, and to reduce the reliance of parties involved in negotiations on arbitration to resolve differences. It represents a new approach to industrial relations for the changing reality of the Australian work force as we approach the 21st century. The new system will create a more flexible framework while at the same time protecting people who have little to bargain or who are in a weak bargaining position. This is a crucial difference between the government's industrial relations policy and the policies of those opposite, which are the same for most coalition type parties in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our system protects workers' wages and conditions through the award system and by the no disadvantage test in the federal Industrial Relations Act. If the coalition followed the example of the Kennett government in Victoria, which it has supported on occasions, it would abolish the safety net of the award system. Workers would only have the protection of a minimum hourly wage, four weeks annual leave, one week sick leave per year and 12 months unpaid parental leave. Jeff Kennett's so-called industrial relations reforms simply swept away every other award condition. One of the principal goals of the legislation is to encourage a wider use of workplace agreements&mdash;and that should be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the workplace agreements already cover 37 per cent of employees under federal awards. This legislation will continue to encourage that process. While this is a substantial proportion of Australian workers, the government recognises the need to encourage the further decentralisation of our industrial relations system. While the government is keen to encourage Australian workers, their unions and employers to come to agreements on working conditions amongst themselves, these agreements are based on the condition that any pre-existing federal award previously operating in that workplace is not weakened. Under this legislation the award system will be maintained, providing a floor for wages and conditions which cannot be undercut by directly negotiated agreements. It will be the duty of the Industrial Relations Commission to protect these basic rates of pay and conditions of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will ensure that awards become more up to date  and relevant to the modern workplace. It will encourage workers, unions and management to work together to reach agreements on how to organise the way work is done at an enterprise level. It is also designed to encourage the insertion of enterprise flexibility clauses into awards by the commission. Individual enterprises, with the agreement of that person's work force, will be able to make variations to the provisions of awards which apply to that person as long as the workers concerned are not disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One section of the legislation which I am particularly proud to support as a Labor member of parliament is the section that gives all workers without adequate protection access to minimum conditions of wages, equal pay for equal work, unpaid parental leave and certain rights relating to the termination of their employment. These are basic rights which all workers are entitled to, but which have been taken away under the reactionary policies of the conservative governments of states such as Victoria and Western Australia. The safeguarding of these rights throughout this legislation meets Australia's international obligations under International Labour Organisation conventions and other international treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect of this section of the legislation which is particularly pleasing to me is the section which places certain obligations on employers who terminate the employment of 15 or more of their workers for economic, technological or structural reasons. The Industrial Relations Commission will be able to order consultation with workers' representatives and it will also be under an obligation to notify the Commonwealth Employment Service. All too often major employers, particularly in regional areas, such as my own, make unilateral decisions to close down their operations without any recognition on their part of their obligations to the welfare of their employees or to the social impact of the closure on the area where the business is located. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, at the present time, there is a clothing factory called the House of Jenyns, which is owned by a company called Tri-International. There is also a similar factory in the southern suburbs of Brisbane in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca). As a result of this company deciding to close and move offshore, it is effectively putting 400 people out of work&mdash;that is directly. I have been rather concerned and particularly critical of that company in the way it has gone about that process. Whilst negotiations are going on now with the workers, when the workers went to negotiate a redundancy package it was rejected by the company. It has now been resolved, but only after those men and, as I said, women in the work force were forced to picket the building and take very strong industrial action. That was something that they did not want to do, but it was forced upon them. They had very little choice but to force that issue and they have now been able to negotiate a reasonable redundancy package. But, overall, I believe that company should have done more to try to change with the times rather than trying to compete in a textile industry that has seen massive changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has been mindful of the need to assist the textile industry, as most honourable members from Victoria would know. There have been positive moves made in that direction over some time. Unfortunately, this company chose not to take it up. I just received a letter from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) today saying just that. But I hope that company will reconsider its position in the likelihood of trying to continue to operate those two clothing factories in Queensland and ensure that we keeps those jobs. That is just one of the areas that I wanted in particular to highlight in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that this bill is something all workers will be proud of and will welcome. I mentioned before the hard work that has been done by the minister and the negotiations he has undertaken. I now come back to the point that I was making about these employers. The provision I referred to in the bill will ensure that employers at least sit down and negotiate reasonable termination conditions with members of their work force before putting them off. That is an important reason that I mentioned before&mdash;but the Department of Employment, Education and Training has a role to play through the CES there. So, by notifying the CES, the employer will also enable the CES to develop a package of employment and training options for the retrenched workers. My local DEET office in Ipswich is actually doing that at the present time and I commend the staff's efforts in that regard. I was talking to the regional manager there only today to ensure that that is still in train. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislative entitlement to 12 months unpaid parental leave is another welcome initiative contained in this legislation. It is a somewhat modern thing. It is funny how the world changes because I can remember at a union conference in Albury-Wodonga many years ago I raised this issue and somebody thought it was a crazy idea. That person felt that mum should be at home with the children and dad should be at work. But I think the world has changed a bit and that it has become a bit more modern. The motion I put before the conference was rejected. The only supporters I had on the floor at the conference were the few women members. Strangely enough, the males did not want to support the motion. They were members of the banking industry and I hope that they have changed their attitudes a bit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having moved around the countryside a bit in a transient sort of job when working for a bank, I ran into that particular problem where parental leave was essential when people did not have their families close by them. In a country such as Australia where people move around a fair bit, it is pretty important. I have the large air force base, Amberley, in my electorate, as I often remind the House. The defence people in that area are also affected in the same way. So I hope they can be assisted somewhere like that as well. Before entering parliament I became most aware of the need for that type of legislation with my own family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, many families find themselves through choice and necessity in the situation where both parents are working. In modern Australia, that does happen and it is something that needs to be recognised more clearly. These sorts of proposals in the legislation will address those issues. Clearly the family unit is not to suffer&mdash;that is important. I just saw an item on the TV news where there was a big push to give the family unit more recognition. I think  that helps the family unit in a lot of ways, by having the parents being able to work together. So for both parents to be able to take time off for the birth of a child is particularly important. I think that is something we should be very proud to support in this parliament. Such conditions are particularly important for workers subject to frequent transfers, as I mentioned before. It is not only in the areas that I mentioned before, for bank employees and defence personnel, but it is also for people in telecommunication areas and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation really strikes a right balance between making our industrial relations system more flexible and protecting the rights and conditions of Australian workers. It allows our industrial relations system to adapt to the needs of the Australian work force as we enter the 21st century, while also maintaining a safety net for workers in a weak bargaining position. They are very important areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I briefly come to the role of the trade union movement. I believe that in modern times in Australia our trade union movement has been second to none. It has been extremely responsible in its attitudes. The minister well knows how hard representatives of the trade union movement can be in negotiations. I know how they were in this particular situation. But at the end of the day, they sat down at the table with the minister and negotiated a very fair package for the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the trade union movement&mdash;from the ACTU down to individual unions&mdash;for working through that, and I commend the minister and his staff for assisting in that area. It has been a difficult period for the minister to develop this legislation and it is right to give him the credit that is due. I was somewhat critical of the legislation in its early stages, but I believe that those concerns came out of my experience in my home state where there were great problems with the SEQEB dispute many years ago. I commend the bill to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>Listening to this debate on the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, I wonder whether those opposite feel proud that they are encouraging Australians to feel wasted and at the bottom of the labour pile when it comes to negotiating with the majority of Australian employers. I note that Jagger's song comes from his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticky Fingers</EMPHASIS> album, which sets the scene for many taking part in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened with interest to the speakers opposite as each has risen to support the legislation. I listened with the hope of hearing a proper understanding of economics and what makes the community go around, and I have been disappointed with the result. Not one speaker has understood the very basis of the future of our country; that is, that there is no work for Australians if there are no companies to employ them. That means that there is no work for Australians wishing to maintain their lifestyle; no work for those Australians wanting to care for their families. There is no work for Australians. No employers means no employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally as important, as stated by each of the government speakers, no employees means no employers. But is this notion correct? Can a company operate without employees, thus increasing the unemployment queues? The answer to that conundrum, as we move towards the technological age, is simply: yes, it can happen. Our Labor colleagues have not quite come to terms with the fact that those who take the risk of investing money&mdash;and we should not be afraid to talk about money&mdash;will not do it if investment is made difficult, and why should they?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our friends opposite will say, `They have a duty&mdash;a moral right to invest their money and employ people'. The reality is that investors, whether they be small business or large business, will not invest and thus employ if it is made difficult for them. It is time that those opposite realised that commercial investment is the basis of our social justice and the ongoing welfare of our community, not the ripping apart of the very fabric of the commercial aspect of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world is rapidly changing. Over 200 years ago, with the evolution into the industrial age, the world rapidly changed to industrialisation. Those who took advantage of that time were the capitalists who invested in industrialisation. Those countries wishing to hang on to the old ways and not wanting to change were left behind in the developing world. The need for unions was essential during that period, and they did their job very well, helping the evolution of communities from the agricultural age to the new industrialised world. They worked hard to gain many social justice reforms, and they helped to ensure that our communities were held responsible for the care of our fellow man. Unions had a very important role to play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, their time has passed, because the challenges which they faced, and duly accepted are no longer with us. The unions no longer play the dominant role within the community that they would have us believe. The membership of unions is reducing with no sign of reversal. Why is this the case? It is my view that unions are becoming irrelevant to the majority of those employed. In my view, one of the reasons for this is that their secretaries and their officers have never been on the factory floor. Most union officials come from universities and then move on to politics, and their members are becoming disappointed with the treatment they receive from their so-called union officials. Technology and its new work demands are upon us and, as we move quickly to the technological or knowledge age, we are finding that the union movement is becoming more and more irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the world's national boundaries break down we are witnessing an increased flow of information. For instance, it is now possible for a graphic designer in my electorate of Cowan to do in one hour what would have normally taken three days to do, and then he can send it off to anywhere in the world and communicate by computer. How does the union movement intend to compete with employees working to satisfy international clients when the need for structured hours and conditions are no longer there? At this very minute the world is trying to re-centre itself. It is desperately trying to build a new set of rules and values that mesh with the emerging social system&mdash;a system which many people do not quite understand. No longer can we allow ourselves to be like ostriches, simply putting our heads in the sand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right now, at the head of every major radio and TV broadcast, we hear and see the issue of values&mdash;or, more precisely, the lack of them&mdash;being raised. We are microscopically examining our values both in the workplace and at the home to discover how we evolved to the position we are in now, but, more importantly, how to redirect some of the potentially wrong turns that we have taken. We all begin life with a clean slate and pick and choose a variety of values as we approach adulthood. Along the way we change and adapt our values based on circumstances and situations set before us. One might say, `But my values have never changed'&mdash;I think that has been evidenced by those opposite during this debate&mdash;values like `all bosses rip off their employees', `all bosses don't care about their employees', and `only the union can provide employees safety nets'. I quote from yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> where the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) was giving an example of these values. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A typical workplace would be a small wholesale company, which employs 20 workers and is non-unionised&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It is probably paying payroll tax. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are numerous grievances. . . the boss is pretty obnoxious, he has a son on the payroll who sexually harasses some of the . . . staff&mdash;that sort of thing happens all the time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He said that that was a typical workplace. Those opposite have clearly stated that enterprise bargaining came from the union movement. That is absolutely bunkum because this type of employee relationship&mdash;enterprise bargaining&mdash;was first developed by an American called Demming back in the 1950s when he went to Japan and developed it there. These values of the industrial age that the union movement talks about are quite out of turn. As we move into this new technological age we need a change in values. This enterprise bargaining idea was not the union's idea but Demming's idea back in the 50s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of Japan and its social wealth has been well documented. It started not with the workers but with the employers. So to put forth the myth that enterprise agreements are the idea of the unions is absolute rubbish. The world of business, as any smart business person knows, is that the company's assets leave at five o'clock every day. If they do not come back the following morning, there are no assets left. The smart employers know that their staff are their major asset. I would think that this is the view of many, or perhaps even most, of the business people in Australia. To think any less is inviting chaos and uncertainty about a company's viability. A partnership between employees and employer is required, not a confrontationist approach from those with the industrial value that employers are the ones holding back development. We need greater negotiation than the union movement is prepared to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No Australian wants to screw another Australian to the ground. Crooks do, yet crooks can be found in employers and employees as well as unions. No-one has the absolute mortgage on purity when it comes to industrial relations. So there is no point in confusing this debate with the bunkum spoken by some of these pro-unionists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is full of the values of the past. It ensures the values of payback to the union movement for its role in ensuring the return of the government at the last election. The union movement was faced with the reduction of the old, archaic industrial values it has held for many years and its leaders, rather than accept change, have demanded that their politician boys respond and respect their closed values and not place them at any threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party, respecting these old world values, has responded and ensured ongoing discrimination within our industrial relations processes. It has not met the challenge of the new age of technology. To fully understand the values of the union movement and its political arm, the Labor Party, no better example is the attitude of the President of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court from 1907 to 1921, Henry Bournes Higgins, described as a middle-class radical and social reformer appointed to his life's work by Deakin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Higgins placed his stamp upon the arbitration court with his Harvester judgment in 1907 which enshrined fair and reasonable wages. The result of this decision was the establishment of the first award wage. He based the 42 shillings a week calculation on the right of a worker with five children. Also taken into account were such things as lighting, clothing, boots, furniture, utensils, rates, life insurance, savings, accident or benefit societies, loss of employment, union pay, books and newspapers, tram and train fares, sewing machines, mangles, school requisites, amusements and holidays, intoxicating liquors, tobacco, sickness and death, religion or charity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This wage fixation system was based on human need, not on profits or productivity. It entrenched the idea of the minimum wage being set by judicial decree. It enshrined the idea of the minimum wage which was sacrosanct and introduced the notion of family welfare into wage setting. It established the notion of the cost of living as a basis for wage movements. Yet, as the world changes, these principles of the union movement and its colleagues opposite do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Higgins was ruthless with his desire to protect his stand. In 1909, with the BHP case, Higgins said that it would be preferable to shut down the mine if BHP could not pay the minimum rate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it is a calamity that this historic mine should close down, it would be a greater calamity that men should be underfed or degraded.</PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment, by implication, was preferable to cheap labour. These are the values of the labour movement through the union movement and its political wing&mdash;`Send the company to the wall, put our brothers on the unemployment line, and long live those still working'. This value has finished for many within industry and commerce and it seems the only ones wishing to hold onto such a concept are the unions and their spokespeople opposite. I wonder what the one in 10 Australians who are currently out of work think about this attitude&mdash;`Send the company to the wall, put our brothers on the unemployment line'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us stands out for one thing and one thing only: it is the total capitulation to the union movement's old age values and is a payback for electoral support. To support this payback notion, I would like to quote Ms Jennie George, a vice-president of the ACTU. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the employers have got to understand is that we won the election in March and this bill is payback for the commitments that were made by the government in the course of the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill is another chapter in the long history of this government paying its political dues to the trade union movement of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of this bill it will now be more expensive to employ an Australian worker&mdash;not for the reasons of those opposite when they suggest that actual wage costs will go down. On this side of the House we support and always have supported the concept of a fair wage for fair work. This coalition view is, I believe, the view of many Australians and is part of our national ethos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real cost of employing people is not wages but rather the silent on-costs associated with wages and salaries. It would be surprising to some to learn that in some cases for every $1 spent on wages by companies a further $2 is spent on essential on-costs. Therefore, salary rates are not the issue that many naive-to-business speakers on the other side have stated. Rather, the on-costs are what employers are seeking flexibility with within this bill. But the bill fails to address these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On-costs like payroll tax and the rates of insurances required to employ staff are good examples of what I am talking about. This bill does not relieve these costs of employing people and, therefore, does not support the notion of reducing unemployment. The bill is too rigid for enterprises&mdash;and by enterprises I mean companies and not the industries with which the unions prefer to deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, industry work conditions have favoured larger companies capable of supporting such conditions. But small business has been sacrificed to the tragic expense of the increasing number of unemployed in Australia, which is now over one in 10. This was the doctrine of Higgins and remains the highly principled values of the union movement and its political wing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is against the basic principles of human rights and discriminates against many Australians. For instance, the bill refers to the noble right to strike. But where is the clause that refers to the right to work? The bill requires employers not to discriminate against union members. But where is the clause protecting non-union members? These are two examples of the bill protecting the ageing and outdated values of the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is cumbersome and is piecemeal in its presentation, for it has over 35 pages covering some 200 amendments. This bill requires employers operating a non-union enterprise to go through four union protected hoops for approval of its agreement. Firstly, notification has to be made to a union to which no-one belongs; secondly, the company then has to observe the award and conditions of a union to which no-one belongs; thirdly, the enterprise then has to seek the approval of the industrial relations court; and, fourthly, the enterprise then has to seek approval from unions to which no-one belongs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not enterprise bargaining or a company negotiating with its staff. This is the retention of the dinosaur values&mdash;outdated values&mdash;driven by the union movement. This bill does not address the demanding issues of the 21st century workplace and continues the dominance of a minority group within the industrial relations system. It is a sad reflection upon the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), noted for his terrier skills in getting what he wants, and it is a sad day that we as an independent nation are hamstrung by the needs of a small group of self-interested, politically ambitious union representatives, like many on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that we accept that the majority of Australians, whether they be employers or employees, are fair-minded and want to contribute to the development of our great country.

But honourable members opposite do not seem to realise that there are two parts to any industrial relations process: one is the worker providing labour; the other is the employer providing investment. If there is no employer, there is no employee. Unfortunately, those opposite and those terriers within the union movement do not quite understand the concept. They do not understand where the money or investment come from. Mick Jagger said, `I can't get no satisfaction'. I cannot get any from this bill either. </PARA>

The third was industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw the opposition's attitude to industrial relations during the election campaign. Led by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the Liberal and National parties proposed to replace industrial awards with individual contracts, abolish the existing arbitration system and force young people onto wages of $3.50 an hour. The opposition's Jobsback policies were to be the most savage attack on the workers of this country ever proposed. The policy talked about greater flexibility in wages and conditions but those opposite were talking about flexibility one way&mdash;down for wages. They wanted to cut wages. We have only to look at what the Kennett government in Victoria has done to see what we would have had nationally had the coalition been elected. </PARA>

The opposition may finally come to understand who won the last election&mdash;and who did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has followed much consultation with the trade union movement, particularly through the ACTU. The opposition has a bit of a problem with this; it does not like us talking to the ACTU. It does not understand that the ACTU is a pretty significant peak council in this country; it represents the trade union movement. Trade unions are the legitimate and historical representatives of workers; and workers, of course, are people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) said that there cannot be employees without employers, but the reverse is obviously true as well. It is on the backs of the workers that this country survives. I am proud to be a former trade unionist and to be part of a government that consults with the ACTU. There were also consultations with employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a former trade unionist, I understand the concerns that many in the union movement had originally with many of the proposals foreshadowed in the drafting of this bill. There were some tense times between the government and the union movement in the lead-up to the legislation. The main concern surrounded the proposal to provide access to enterprise agreements for non-unionists within the system of enterprise bargaining. I can well understand the concerns of the union movement about this, as I will explain later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always had reservations about the concept of enterprise bargaining and the decentralisation of industrial relations. I always took the view that the decentralised system that we have had for most of this century, whilst by no means perfect, has served us well. Enterprise bargaining, on the other hand, is a by-product of the New Right economic rationalist thinking which dominated economic policy during the 1980s. It had the potential of breaking up the union movement into bite-sized chunks&mdash;just the right size to be gobbled up by predatory employers, particularly in the event of a coalition government either at state or federal level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the ACTU and the trade union movement, in their wisdom, embraced enterprise bargaining. I emphasise that the brand of enterprise bargaining supported by this government, and agreed to by the ACTU, was vastly different from the sort of enterprise bargaining advocated by the opposition and some employers. One would question whether the opposition supports enterprise bargaining at all. It appears to be more interested in individual bargaining than in any genuine collective bargaining at enterprise level; that is, bypassing unions and `negotiating' with workers one by one. We all know what that means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The icon of the New Right, the small business spokesperson Mr Peter Boyle, responded when asked a question about what would happen if an employee did not like a draft contract provided by an employer, `Beggars can't be choosers'. It is pretty obvious what he means by that: if an individual supposedly negotiating wages and conditions with an all-powerful employer did not like what was offered, that person would be shown the door and told, `Don't come back on Monday; find another job if you can. Good luck'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the opposition policies are all about. Let us not have this nonsense about genuine enterprise bargaining and flexibility. It wanted the flexibility to have a totally employer-dominated market. As I said, the ACTU embraced a system of enterprise bargaining which was underpinned by the award system. It was inevitable, in my view, that there would be pressure in some industries for access to enterprise bargaining for those workers who were not members of unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, this aspect of the bill initially caused most concern to the ACTU and the affiliated unions. It is a fair question: why should the benefits of trade union membership be shared by people who are not members?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Scab employees enjoy the benefits of awards and conditions, and only 60 or 70 per cent of employees in the public sector are members of unions. Having said that, the reality is that in the private sector 71 per cent of workers currently are not members of a trade union. There are many reasons for this. To put this figure into context, while only 29 per cent of workers in the private sector are union members, about 82 per cent of workplaces have some union members, or at least are under union coverage. This still leaves about 18 per cent of workplaces virtually non-unionised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many reason why this is the case. It is not as simple as saying that people do not want to join a union. Many of the non-unionised workplaces are small businesses, including family businesses. It is quite understandable that many workers in these situations have never seen a practical need to be a member of a union. This would apply particularly where the nature of the employment is such that it would be unclear to an individual which union might cover that person and whether the union's coverage would be relevant or beneficial in the particular circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue is accessibility to union membership. In some industries, particularly the newer ones such as the computer industry, tourism, other service industries and some parts of the retail sector, there may be no union which has had traditional or well-established coverage of the work involved. I am sorry that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) has left because I would have liked to hear his response to what I am about to say. There are many examples of a worker wanting to become a member of a union but being afraid to do so for fear of being dismissed. Some people join the relevant union but keep this fact secret from the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One fast food chain is notorious for this situation. This would have become a much greater problem had the coalition been elected because its policies would have facilitated and even encouraged exploitation of workers, which sometimes occurs now in the industrially weak areas of the work force. There are many reasons why it may be impractical, or at the least difficult, for individual workers to join unions, let alone become active members. Perhaps some unions need to upgrade their coverage of recruitment arrangements to reflect the changing nature and types of industries&mdash;although I am certain the union movement is already mindful of this fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, with the statistics that I have referred to in mind, and particularly with the decentralisation of industrial relations and the emergence of enterprise based bargaining, it was inevitable that there would be a need to consider the issue of access to enterprise bargaining for those workers who, for whatever reasons, are not members of unions. So, with the legitimate concerns of the union movement in mind, the government has produced a system outlined in this bill which allows that access for non-unionists under a set of conditions which emphasises and retains the primacy of the award system; which protects minimum standards; which provides a no disadvantage test in enterprise agreements; which indeed provides that there must be an award in place before any such agreement is reached; which gives registered unions access to industrial relations proceedings before agreements are ratified; and which protects union members against discrimination and victimisation in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also removes a number of draconian and outdated provisions in existing legislation as has been sought by the union movement. Obvious examples of that are the removal of sections 45D and 45E from the Trade Practices Act. Some people in the union movement will still be concerned about certain aspects of this bill, particularly the issue that I have mentioned of non-unionist access to the system of enterprise agreements. But, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said about Mabo, nobody will get everything that they want from this bill. Having said that, I believe it will go a long way towards satisfying the concerns of a majority of reasonable people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this bill throws out a worthy challenge to unions. Put simply, the challenge to unions is to go out and recruit more members. With the award system still in place and with unions retaining their rightful place as the principal players representing workers, there is plenty that unions have to offer to prospective members. As I have said, unions will need to adapt their recruitment techniques, public relations and internal structures to reflect the changing work force of the 1990s and beyond. Much has been done in this area already. However, the efficiencies gained by union amalgamations will need to be balanced against the need for unions to be relevant and responsive to workers at the grassroots level, particularly with a view to making inroads into that 71 per cent of non-union members in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to a matter which can only emphasise the importance of having a fair, just and cohesive industrial relations system such as that outlined in this bill, as opposed to the law of the jungle approach favoured by those opposite. I draw the attention of honourable members to report No. 326 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An assessment of tax</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled yesterday.

Let us look at the so-called overgenerous benefits and privileges that the would-be honourable member for Mackellar has suggested. She says that the union was given privileges to which it should otherwise not have been entitled. She also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the outset, the Union was promised no compulsory retrenchments as a result of modernisation and no reduction in the classification of positions.</PARA>

As I have said, it is important to have legislation like we have at the moment&mdash;not to take the law of the jungle approach as those on the other side have. Let us have a look at these so-called outrageous concessions that the union was given in the tax office. Senator Bishop claims that there was a bar placed by this agreement on consultants and contractors. If she is so concerned about taxpayers' money and costs, surely she can understand that any consultant or contractor will cost the taxpayer a lot more than it would if the work was done by an officer of the tax office. It is a pretty stupid statement to make if she is talking seriously about saving taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to even more outrageous statements by Senator Bishop, the would-be honourable member for Mackellar. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To say some of the terms reached in relation to the work environment were overgenerous is an understatement. For instance, no staff member is to be required to work for more than four hours on any one day on keyboard duties.</PARA>
<PARA>Heavens above! Does Senator Bishop not realise that the 50 per cent keying rule is a standard practice in the public sector and, if it is not standard practice in the private sector, it certainly should be. This originated from a report commissioned by the Public Service Board in 1983, because the Public Service Board and the government were concerned about the incidence of repetitive strain injury&mdash;otherwise known as RSI&mdash;in the work force. I would have thought that Senator Bishop would have been a bit more concerned for the female work force than to criticise any agreement which provides protection for keyboard workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The incidence of RSI was so great that the result of this report led to significant reforms which were in the second tier wage agreement in 1987. They were also endorsed in the national wage principle that year. Senator Bishop would not realise this, because she never does her homework; she just likes to grandstand. But the reality is that the second tier wage agreement in the Australian Public Service is one of the most far reaching and historic agreements that there have ever been. It created huge efficiencies and micro-economic reforms in the Australian public sector. It amalgamated the divisions of the Public Service, it created a single career stream rather than having all of those anomalies and stereotype jobs&mdash;particularly keyboard workers who were predominantly low paid female workers in those days&mdash;and it provided protection against overuse of keyboards. It is standard in the public sector&mdash;and should be if it is not already in the private sector&mdash;that keyboard operators should not work more than half of any one day on the keyboard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Officers who are required to use screen-based equipment will be entitled to free eyesight tests, and where spectacles are required for such work, the ATO will be required to reimburse the cost of standard frames and monofocal lenses.</PARA>
<PARA>What a terrible thing! I happen to have a bit of a background on this issue because in 1980, at an annual general meeting of the union of which I was a member, a resolution was passed in my name which set in motion a review of policy of the then ACOA on screen based equipment. That led to the union's comprehensive policy on screen based equipment which, in turn, led to significant negotiations in areas like social security with the Stratplan agreement and then, eventually, the modernisation agreement. Now the PSU has across the board agreements about screen based equipment. When there is new technology, there are the dangers of overuse of screen based equipment and appropriate occupational health and safety measures have to be put in place, just as has to be done for keyboard work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely amazing that Senator Bishop appears to have no knowledge of occupational health and safety matters, let alone decent industrial relations practices. Indeed one could say that the tax office, if it does not have proper practices in place to safeguard against injury to keyboard workers or people using screen based equipment and suddenly has a lot of compensation cases, could be very heavily criticised. Its Comcare premiums might go up, not to mention other legal actions that could be taken against the tax office. That seems to have escaped Senator Bishop and those on the other side who do not believe in good industrial relations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993. This bill chains us to the rocks as we face an incoming tide. The tide of reform in the world economy is moving consistently towards more flexible working arrangements. The government has acknowledged this by supporting limited enterprise bargaining but, as they are controlled by thier union masters, this bill firmly chains Australian workers to the rocks of the award system. Our only option is to manage change to ensure that we improve our international competitiveness in a way which is socially beneficial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our centralised system of wage fixation maintains a complex system of awards governing wages and conditions of employment. It is outmoded in the dynamic international labour market in which we find ourselves. As a result it is a barrier to job creation. Professor Garnaut recently said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through closer integration with the international economy . . . and improvements in competitiveness, Australia can restore full employment. This may not be full employment with a distribution of income that Australians judge to be just. But high unemployment is the worst injustice and a fully employed, competitive Australia will have the economic resources to provide services through government budgets to those Australians who are dealt the weakest hand in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA>I will focus on how this bill will affect women in the work force. I do so not only because there are so few women in the House to provide this perspective, but also because women as a group are a good case study to highlight the impact of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifty-two per cent of women are in the paid work force. Gender segregation of the work force is more pronounced in Australia than in comparable countries. In Australia 36 per cent of full-time, full-year female workers are employed in clerical occupations, and 16 per cent are in sales work. Women are concentrated in areas which receive wages below the national average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within individual workplaces women tend to occupy lower status and lower paid positions&mdash;the glass ceiling effect. Women's career progress tends to be less than that of men. Women are more likely than men to drop out of the work force to embrace family responsibilities. Women have less access to accredited training than do men. Women's skills tend to be undervalued and under-recognised. Women are more likely than men to be poorly paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social conditioning continues to tell against women who attempt to negotiate a better deal. Dale Spender reputedly summed it up when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When men and women argue, women lose.</PARA>
<PARA>Women are disadvantaged when, as is all too frequently the case, women have to deal with male employers. They have this weight of disadvantage holding them up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what are unions doing to help women? It could be argued that, working from a position of disadvantage, women could therefore benefit from the support of the union movement. However, unions do not represent women. Women predominate in areas which have less industrial muscle. In August 1992 only 35 per cent of female employees were union members compared with 43 per cent of male workers. Women who work less than full-time hours are less likely to be unionists than women in full-time work. In 1992, only 16.5 per cent of female casual employees were union members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women who work in locations which employ fewer than 10 workers are far less likely to be members of trade unions than are women who work in large workplaces, and 12.1 per cent of women who work in locations which employ fewer than 10 staff are union members. In workplaces which employ over 100 workers, this figure rises to 52.8 per cent. Women are also under-represented in union structures. In mid-1992, only 10 of the 38 people who held executive positions within the Australian Council of Trade Unions were women. Three of those positions were affirmative action positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us never forget that, historically, unions have opposed women being allowed into the work force, on the ground that they were taking men's jobs. Although the union movement has affirmed a commitment to improving the gender balance within its structures, the fact remains that at present unions cannot hope to represent the interests of women, particularly women who work part time in small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enterprise bargaining offers the prospects of huge benefits for Australian women workers. For example, take the case of maternity leave. Under the awards, women in full-time employment taking maternity leave must come back full time at the completion of their leave. But many women would prefer to move progressively back into full-time work, starting a day here or there as a casual&mdash;perhaps coming back a day or two a week as the child settles into child care&mdash;and eventually resuming full-time work. With this sort of flexibility workers are more likely to return to work earlier, ensuring better skill retention. As a former manager, I know that there are great benefits in flexibility of working arrangements, including employee contentment, productivity and the retention of a highly skilled and loyal work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the provisions of this bill which legislate for unpaid parental leave as a minimum entitlement for all workers. However, we should be aware that the provision of parental leave is only half the solution. It is most important that there be flexible working arrangements to allow a worker returning to work after such leave to make the transition to work effectively. Perhaps enterprise bargaining will deliver this flexibility where the government has failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As women continue to be the primary caregivers in Australian society for both the young and the elderly, it is inevitable that they will have more complex needs in working arrangements. For example, female participation is often dependent on community services that are available only during normal working hours on weekdays, such as child care. Women will have to work twice as hard as men and be twice as smart to achieve their objectives in enterprise bargaining. But we should not walk away from that challenge. Firstly, we have been doing it for decades; secondly, we have much more to gain from the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the House to proposals of the New South Wales Liberal government to improve career paths for women in the public sector under the nation's only female Minister for Industrial Relations and Employment, Mrs Chikarovski. The draft proposals include job sharing at all levels of the public service, with an emphasis on senior career positions; family leave to let workers legitimately take time off to care for children or sick or elderly relatives; part-time work, including three-day weeks or part-year employment to help working couples share in child rearing; and home based working. Mrs Chikarovski said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we're looking at encouraging work practices in the Public Service that allow women to work at their careers but take note that many have family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>She noted that enterprise bargaining, which is being introduced progressively throughout the New South Wales Public Service, was an obvious way to introduce these reforms. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously, enterprise bargaining gives us the flexibility to do these sorts of things because you can start negotiating different work structures.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Judith Sloan, another woman leader in the industrial relations field, has concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Female workers have lower earnings because they are less skilled, have less education, have had interrupted work careers or have worked part-time. . . . The very circumstances of women, particularly arising from child-bearing and rearing, will limit their ability to undertake training, acquire further education and work full-time.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, women do not apologise for putting priority on their families. Women value children and the elderly, and choose to care for them at a greater rate than do men. But we must take action to reduce the impact that this choice has on the employment prospects of women. For example, we should be providing education options which are accessible to women. Professor Sloan mentions the limited ability that women have to participate in training and further education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business courses at Macquarie University are a good case study. The Macquarie Graduate School of Management has been operating for 25 years, and has the oldest established Master of Business Administration degree in New South Wales. One of the school's key courses is the advanced management program, a four-week residential school which attracts about 40 participants, of which only one or two would be women. Mr Gregory Dunne, the General Manager of the school, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The greatest difficulty for women is that they are not always accessible to the programs because they have other considerations, such as family, to take into account and being away from home for four weeks is simply out of the question.</PARA>
<PARA>The school has responded by structuring courses to take into account the dual role of many potential female attendees. The Women in Management course is held each year as a two-day non-residential course and regularly attracts hundreds of women. Courses such as the emerging managers program operate from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., Monday to Friday, for two weeks with a break in the workplace in between. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The award system was established by men and for men. It must be opened up to the fresh winds of enterprise bargaining. All this bill does is reaffirm the government's commitment to the old, tired industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to ask how enterprise bargaining is affecting women workers. There is still very little factual information about the impact that enterprise bargaining has had upon women in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many agreements offer opportunities that will prove beneficial to both male and female workers. For example, the Bendix Mintex agreement incorporates a commitment to reduce the divide between management and staff by fostering a team approach.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some agreements will be particularly beneficial to those who shoulder the double shift of domestic and paid employment&mdash;that is, women. For example, the Optus agreement incorporates part-time work provisions especially designed to cater to those with family responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some agreements will need to be examined in their application to assess their impact upon women workers. For example, the AMP Customer Service Division agreement allows employees to work from home. It remains to be seen whether this clause proves beneficial to women who juggle work and family responsibilities or whether in fact it merely enables them to perform both their paid and unpaid occupations simultaneously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not a blind zealot in my support for enterprise bargaining. I acknowledge the persistence of sexism and the resultant unequal bargaining relationships under which women must operate in the labour force. It is likely that some women will be disadvantaged by enterprise bargaining. In fact, I am concerned that some agreements already settled will operate to the detriment of women, especially those who have parenting responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Alcoa Point Henry agreement, for example, incorporates mandatory overtime shifts each week. Such a work pattern presents an obvious hurdle for workers with family responsibilities but will also prove detrimental to the spouses of those who do work under such arrangements&mdash;eliciting a domestic contribution from someone who has just worked 12 hours seems fairly unlikely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Pay Equity Coalition conducted a review of the 20 largest agreements for its submission to the last national wage case. It found that women under enterprise bargaining agreements are less likely to participate and be represented in bargaining, are getting lower and later wage increases than men, and are getting less access to new classifications and training than are men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are features in the labour force which make women vulnerable in enterprise bargaining. Firstly, there is occupational segregation. Women are overrepresented in people oriented activities, such as sales and service work areas, where it is difficult to measure productivity. Women are overrepresented in less profitable industries, such as the textiles industry, where scope for productivity based wage increases is limited. Secondly, there is minority status. Women's interests are often overlooked when working conditions are agreed to by most workers and imposed on all workers. Thirdly, there is persistent sexism. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs acknowledged last year that sex discrimination continues to play a part in the subjection of women in the workplace. Research suggests that 10 per cent of the gender wages gap exists because of sex discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is growing evidence that the centralised wage fixation system is failing women. After making consistent gains over the past 20 years, in the past two years women's pay has fallen from 84.6 per cent of men's full-time adult ordinary time earnings to 83.8 per cent. The award system has proven to be damaging to women even without overt discrimination on the face of the awards. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has found that sexual discrimination is a factor which leads to the lower overaward payments of women. In announcing the tabling of the report, Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Quentin Bryce, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report sounds a warning of what could happen to women's wages in the move to a less regulated industrial system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overawards are payments negotiated outside the award structure. Women have been disadvantaged in this area because of their lack of bargaining power and because the work that they do is undervalued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless safeguards are in place the earnings gap between men and women could widen even further.</PARA>
<PARA>We should not forget that this current web of discrimination was developed under a centralised wage fixing system. Centralism has not protected women from discrimination, neither have the unions. Women need to take action for themselves to craft working arrangements that are fair, flexible and efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The likely impact of enterprise bargaining on women is not clear. A survey of federal enterprise agreements by the Commonwealth Department of Industrial Relations found that 24 per cent of men received a pay rise compared with 15 per cent of women. This may reflect that women are bargaining for non-wage benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, consider the situation that exists in the United States. The United States has one of the most deregulated labour markets in the world, and unionisation in the private sector is just above 10 per cent. Yet in the past decade the gender earnings differential has narrowed. Women's wages have increased from just over 60 per cent of male wages to over 70 per cent&mdash;a 10 per cent shift. The jury is still out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we develop enterprise bargaining we need to take measures to ensure that equal employment opportunity is not impeded. One proposal is that there should be a standards framework within which the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is subject to the advice of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. The AIRC would have a monitoring role to order alterations to discriminatory agreements. Another would be to develop legislative minimum standards such as this bill contains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the problem is that a formal standard for enterprise agreements will need to be so general that they will not highlight situations of discrimination. For example, the introduction of 12-hour shifts may not be discriminatory to most people who work in the particular enterprise, but many women are highly unlikely to be able to join that enterprise with shifts that make child care impossible. It is this indirect discrimination that is the greatest danger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best protection for women is women themselves. They know what their interests are. They need to be empowered to pursue them. The government has failed them, the centralised wage fixing system has failed them and the unions have failed them. Our first goal should be to provide widespread education for women workers. The President of the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board, Mr Steve Mark, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People do not know that they are being disadvantaged and the most important issue we can focus on is education . . . Women are not consciously excluded but workplace committees are not forced to think about these issues.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps it would be helpful to require bargaining units to provide statements on the effect of their agreement on a set of underrepresented groups. Further, we should establish an employee advocate as proposed by the coalition at the last federal election. Women do not belong to, and do not identify with, unions. We should offer support to women to pursue their industrial interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women are interested in enterprise bargaining but are having trouble getting access to it. Clearly, we must maintain a watching brief on the impact of enterprise bargaining on women. However, faced with an award system which, two decades after the equal pay decision, is still not able to provide equity, why would women not give enterprise bargaining a go?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must address the issue of why women are not getting access to enterprise bargaining. I consider that most workers, male and female, continue to exist in the conflict mind frame that was a feature of the award system. Yet, enterprise bargaining cannot operate effectively unless a climate of good faith exists between employees and employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is clearly failing to change the attitude of workers. It points to the unions as being largely responsible for the educative process of enterprise bargaining. Unions are a product of the class war mentality. Their lifeblood is conflict, so how will they cultivate an ethos of mutual respect and cooperation? Unions do not represent or talk to most women workers. How can they possibly educate them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet this bill seeks to further entrench the role of unions in the industrial relations sector. This will be to the detriment of women workers. The safeguards proposed by the minor Senate parties, which involve an annual survey of agreements, are not going to do anything. The government ought to spend less money on promoting the proposed changes and more on education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business and government have a mutual interest in ensuring that women are equipped with the skills to strike effective and fair deals. Only then can we be confident that we are getting working arrangements which are economically productive, promote employment and are socially beneficial. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is true to say that it was not so much that the government won the election as the opposition lost it. Its manifest of proposals was not implemented; ours was. We said that we were not going to set the clock back with respect to industrial relations. We said that we were in favour of enterprise agreements and would be bringing down legislation&mdash;and we are bringing down legislation. We are facilitating enterprise agreements. I do not understand why the opposition is so uptight about this. It is no secret what we were going to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 1,200 enterprise agreements have already been ratified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Some 37 per cent of all workers in Australia are covered by enterprise agreements. But what is the difference when government members talk about enterprise agreements and when opposition members talk about them? There is a great deal of difference. There is no safety net in the opposition's proposal. We say that when workers and management get together to develop new and better ways of working, when we are able to eradicate things that have been entrenched over years&mdash;such as demarcations between different work groups&mdash;and when new technology is introduced, both should share in the consequent improvements. That is our approach. It should not be all one-way traffic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference is even more fundamental than that. On this side of the House, we fundamentally believe that it is not appropriate or realistic and will not get us anywhere to believe that we can engineer a further recovery by driving down wages. We can never hope to compete with low wages in Indonesia or Malaysia or some of those other countries. In Japan, Korea and Taiwan, wages are even higher than they are in Australia. This whole philosophy that there is a simple tick solution for enterprises&mdash;whether they be small, medium or very large businesses&mdash;of getting a cheaper labour input to provide all the solutions is totally rejected by this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the 1980s, there has been considerable wage restraint. Wages have not kept pace with inflation. But through the accord process this government has been able to negotiate a social wage. I do not want to go into the issue of a social wage tonight. Even so, I am trying to acknowledge the point that wages have not kept pace with inflation. We do not believe that flattening wages, which was at the core of the opposition's policies when it went to the people at the last election, is the economic solution that will get us going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why, when we talk about enterprise agreements, we want a win-win situation. We want the enterprise and the management to win, but we also want the workers to win. We want to make sure that there are safety nets because opposition members like to quote examples of different trade union activity. Fundamentally and at my core I am a Labor man; I will always support the trade union movement. If that is what the shadow minister was driving at, I plead guilty; I really am a Labor traditionalist. But, like many organisations, I am sure that the performance of trade unions fits a normal, standard curve, as I suggest does business management or even the organisations that are established to represent the employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should we have trade unions? Why should Labor members feel so strongly about trade unions? Basically, because we believe that ordinary men and women have the right to organise themselves, elect officials and negotiate on an equal basis with employers. That is why we fundamentally believe in trade unions. We think it is a right that all Australians should enjoy. If we want to talk about how to gear this economy up even further&mdash;something the opposition focuses on so often&mdash;and while I am pleased see the elimination of some practices, such as demarcations and too many awards in a particular industry sector, we should also point the finger at the other side, in a balanced way, and acknowledge that management has a lot to answer for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember going around the country when I was Chairman of the House of Representative Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training when we had a skills reference. I particularly remember one Tasmanian factory. Along with other committee members, I had the privilege of talking to workers on the floor as well as to management. We were discussing enterprise agreements. One of the things a worker said to me was, `Before we got this enterprise agreement, as a worker, when I clocked on, I was expected to leave my brains behind. As soon as I clocked on, I was expected to leave my brains behind'. I think that is a reflection of a very outdated structure which was all too common in Australia.

What I am saying is that there ought to be minimum standards and the award safety net. When people sit down and negotiate, some of those benefits and some of the profits that flow from them should go to the worker as much as to the enterprise.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition wants to take a sledgehammer to the workers, and it wants to negotiate on an individual basis with each and every person.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is far too little investment. Management has a lot to answer for. I am pleased to see that the legislation has recently come forward in the House. I was appalled when the National Association of Forest Industries came before the caucus task force. The association was talking about what I think are very exciting opportunities for the industry to really grow, to value add and, in particular, to export. We were told that one of the real tragedies in this country is that we do not have the information&mdash;we have never done the research&mdash;to be able to tell us exactly what Australian woods we can use to replace imported timbers in housing, in window framing and in doors. Is that not a tragedy? Is that not sad? The industry has been operating for all these years&mdash;often in controversial circumstances&mdash;and we do not have the information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were given another example concerning the impact that steel is having in home building. The association suspects that with proper research we may be able to reduce the amount of wood required in the standard construction of a house by up to 25 per cent, making timber even more competitive with steel. What is the problem? The problem is that we have not done the research. I find it tragic. I appeal to members on both sides of the House. I know I have a sympathetic audience on this side of the House, but those opposite see things in a one-dimensional way, with one-shot solutions to difficult problems. Providing coolie wages for Australian workers is not the way to get over the problems with our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased&mdash;I hope those opposite are also&mdash;with the fact that the economy has recorded seven consecutive quarters of growth, and there is every indication that it appears to be gathering a bit of a head of steam. I sincerely hope so. But, of course, we do have a lot of unemployed people. There have been some real changes in the nature of long-term unemployed in the economy. Regrettably, with every recession, the hangover of long-term unemployed has been greater than in the previous recession, and that is the case now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, through the 1980s when our economy was growing at such a rapid rate, we had an increase of some 1.6 million in the number of workers in the economy, but the unemployed were taken up at the rate of only one in seven. The unemployed present a particular challenge. I would not want to pre-empt what the expert committee might say in its white paper, but I want to raise the issue of the most marginalised unemployed. They are often characterised as people who have left school at grade 6, grade 7, grade 8, grade 9 or grade 10. Because we are looking for an ever-increasingly skilled work force, these people do not have much hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that the government appears to be adopting very innovative problems&mdash;one being the community activity program designed to address the needs of these young people, and also, I might say, some older workers as well. That is exciting because we have not done that for 10 years. If a Labor government is not going to stand up and attempt to meet the needs of the most marginalised in the community, then I guess we cannot expect it from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a special plea: we have to stop the young people from slipping through the hole. I am really concerned that the trends in education are such that we are giving power to principals to expel students rather than trying to address the cause of the behaviour that is leading them to that action. They are in effect punishing the effects. Often the problem is concerned with literacy. I find it really hard to credit that in the 1990s we still have an education system that is graduating students at year 10 who are functionally illiterate. I am appalled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is debate in the community about appropriate methods of teaching literacy. I think the federal government has a special responsibility in this regard. At best, I hope we adopt approaches that yield results rather than get involved in the particular ideology or methodology of the approach. But, if we cannot do that, we can at least opt for systems that are delivering results, and delivering results for people who are illiterate. I believe we have that responsibility. As much as I am really delighted that we are developing innovative programs that are reaching out to the most marginalised people, I believe that we have to start chopping off the number of candidates that are being produced through the system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Whilst I concede that I agree with some of the things that the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) said, I believe he and others would do well to listen to what is said on this side of the chamber. I was particularly attracted by the thoughtful, compassionate and erudite comments of our last speaker, the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), where she put down in meticulous detail how the present system, as it works in this country, is disadvantaging women in the work force. I thought it was an excellent contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very disappointed to be standing here at a time when Australia is struggling to come out of a recession&mdash;the recession the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said we had to have&mdash;and to be debating a piece of legislation that, in so many aspects, will take industrial relations back into the 1940s in this country. The world is decentralising its labour employee relationships and yet Australia is moving so slowly. It seems to me that Australia is now the only industrial nation left which still has a centralised compulsory arbitration system. Yet we have this bill here today&mdash;this thick bill of a couple of hundred pages&mdash;which will hand back considerable power to the trade unions. It will increase the rigidity of the industrial relations system. It will slow down and block the move towards enterprise bargaining which is so needed in this country. It will, above all else, increase the difficulties and the costs of employers to hire labour in this country. Goodness me, the No. 1 problem in this country is that we have a million people unemployed, and the government seems to have forgotten that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, this bill strengthens the award system, uses the external affairs power and ILO conventions to create minimum wages and conditions, significantly lessens sanctions for industrial disputes, creates a new form of enterprise agreement for non-union workplaces and creates an industrial relations court. In saying that, I find the claims by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) about what this bill will do absolutely incredulous. He says that this bill will improve industrial relations in this country&mdash;for heaven's sake&mdash;and will increase flexibility. These sorts of claims remind me of examples of when language is used that is opposite to the truth, which we have so often seen around this world. Remember communist East Germany? What was that called? It was called the German Democratic Republic. Democratic is one thing that it was not. We call terrorists around the world who try to overthrow elected governments freedom fighters. The government even indulges in that from time to time. This year a budget bill was called the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, which is pushing the deficit up by $15 billion, or whatever it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating another classic example here tonight. As has been said by the shadow minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), this bill is nothing more or less than a pay-off to trade unions for spending $2 million&mdash;or whatever it was&mdash;during the last election campaign when they acted as surrogates for the Labor Party to spread misinformation of what the coalition was offering to the Australian people. I might add that the government, from the latest figures I have, has given $45 million in grants to trade unions over past years. So the government has an interesting system where it pours taxpayers' money into the trade union movement and the trade unions, in return, support it in an election campaign to a very handsome extent indeed. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the employers have got to understand is that we won the election in March and this bill is a pay back for the commitments that were made by the government in the course of that election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that sums it up. The unions are getting a little desperate in this country. Their relevance to the work force is becoming less and less. I see now that only 29.4 per cent in the private sector are unionised compared with 67.1 per cent in the public sector where the unions, with the help of the government, can exert coercion and extract a higher level of unionism. The unions are now trying to shore up their place. They have spoken to the minister and they got their deal. It is mirrored in some very interesting figures. Workplaces with fewer than 10 employees have only 16.3 per cent unionism; those with between 10 and 19 employees, 29.8 per cent unionism; 20 to 99 employees, 46.1 per cent unionism; and workplaces with greater than 100 employees, 57.6 per cent unionism. But, despite that, 67 per cent of private sector workplaces have no unions members at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn specifically to sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. Of course, these refer to the area where provisions are in place to stop those silly secondary boycotts that used to so cripple this country. The legislation, which has been in place for 16 years now, has been very successful in cutting out those silly strikes&mdash;not just to benefit industry but also to benefit workers in the industry and of course Australia as a whole. Those sections were able to do that because they cut out the coercion, the threats and the bullyboy tactics. A minister from the New South Wales right wing of the ALP now appropriately wants to do away with that legislation somehow. Why he would want to change highly successful legislation must be beyond the reasoning of any decent man or woman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, it will take away the access of the employer who comes under these coercive tactics from the real courts&mdash;the common law courts. This legislation will be taken out of the Trade Practices Act and put into the Industrial Relations Court&mdash;the industrial relations club, in effect. Access to remedies will become much more restrictive than it has been. I think this will be particularly onerous on small business, which is pertinent to my electorate. If a secondary boycott were put on small businesses in my electorate, they could immediately get injunctive relief for that. That will now pass. An unbelievable 72-hour provision has been put in&mdash;as if small businesses can get remedies after 72 hours. So many small businesses are at the edge of collapse now because of this government's economic policy. It is not just small business. Think what this will do to the shipping industry where the daily costs are horrific or to the building industry where daily costs are also very high. If they have to wait 72 hours before they can get action, they could be done in. I am amazed that the minister is party to facilitating this union requirement so that unions can blackmail business. The minister is handing unions the ultimate weapon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many new laws in what the minister proposes to replace which I do not think even cover what would have been many past section 45D actions. I will give a few examples. Examples of past section 45D actions not in support of a claim, the subject of industrial disputes, appear to include the 1986 case Gibbins v. AMIEU, where the dispute was caused by that union's objections to the export of live sheep. They do not seem to include the 1977 Utah v. SUA case, where the dispute was over a union's desire to expand the employment of Australian seamen. They do not appear to include the 1978 Metro Meat v. AMIEU case, which again was a dispute over the export of live sheep. They do not include the 1983 Columbus Shipping Line case, which was a dispute over the banning of a ship because it was a cross-trader. In other words, it was not an Australian or North American line. They do not include the 1978 Wribass case that was a dispute over Saturday trading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can quote other cases. Pioneer Concrete had four cases brought under a section 45D action. Two of those cases do not appear to be actionable now under the new provisions because the disputes were about relationships between the company and the contractors. In the other two cases, it is because the primary boycotts exemption would apply. This will not be covered. Also, it appears it is not even clear that the anticipatory injunctions would be available under the new provisions that the minister is putting before us. Before we could restrain threatened boycotts under section 45D, section 80(1) of the Trade Practices Act. That seems to be gone. So I think we have taken a step back into the past under what is proposed here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the award system. That is being reinforced in this bill by making the commission responsible for its maintenance instead of the employers and unions or whoever. A whole new raft of minimum terms and conditions are to be put before us. The bill sets minimum standards based on awards which can apply right across Australia. It appears it is going to override state awards, state legislation and state based entitlements by the devious, backdoor method of the external affairs power, which was never intended to be used in this manner. This applies apparently because we are a signatory to the ILO conventions. I think it is absolutely disgusting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The balance of power in this country in industrial relations is delicate enough as it is without tilting it in such a major way towards the trade union movement. To use the external affairs powers in this way opens up a whole new ball-game. It brings in creeping centralisation of power; it is an extension of federal power that threatens, I believe, future labour market reforms that we are starting to see in states around this country with Liberal-National Party governments. I believe the government's interpretation of the ILO conventions is wrong. It is interesting to turn to schedule V of the ILO convention relating to minimum wages. For example, article 1, section 1, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each member of the ILO which ratifies this convention undertakes to establish a system of minimum wages which covers all groups of wage earners whose terms of employment are such that coverage would be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>That is high powered stuff. Most of us would perhaps aspire to that, but who are the signatories to this ILO? I see in the list before me such luminaries as Afghanistan, Albania&mdash;probably the most oppressive country in the world until recently&mdash;Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Bolivia and Burundi. I think one of the ministers was tied up there recently because he could not get out of the place. There is Cambodia, Chad, communist China, Congo, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala and Haiti. For heaven's sake! Can you believe it: Haiti is a signatory to the ILO which we are now saying we have to support. Does that country support it? There is Iran, Iraq, Laos, Mongolia, Mozambique, Myanmar&mdash;that is the code name for communist Burma&mdash;Nicaragua, Romania, Rwanda, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe. </PARA>

I put it to honourable members that this government, despite being a signatory and trumpeting what a wonderful thing the ILO convention is, is already in breach of it, yet it is trying to impose on us in this country restrictions that are going to dilute the cherished sovereignty of this great country&mdash;or once great country. Under this government, one wonders whether that will continue. I believe this government is selling out Australia's independence at the very time when it is trying to get rid of the monarchy because, as it said, `We will be more independent somehow under a republic'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read the 570-page tome on the republic and to look up the examples that were studied. Trinidad and Tobago were studied at length and were given a whole chapter&mdash;also Mauritius, India and the Prime Minister's beloved Ireland. Even though I have a fair splash of Irish blood in me, of which I am very proud, I am disappointed that the Prime Minister's bog-Irish is colouring his judgment in his anti-British sentiment. If he wants to get rid of a few things British, let him get rid of all the remnants of the British craft trade union system. That would be the way to go if we want to make this country a little bit more independent than it is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the new requirements for the minimum standards provisions. We have the minimum wages, which I have mentioned, which can be fixed by the commission. We have equal wages and remuneration. We have parental leave unpaid for 52 weeks. We have termination of employment conditions. That is quite an onerous condition. Before an employer can lay off someone they must notify and consult the CES and the trade unions. If an employer fails to do this there are penalties. One can imagine the difficulties this is going to cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission is obliged to take into account&mdash;here is another convention we have signed&mdash;the ILO's family responsibilities convention to prevent discrimination against employees with family responsibilities and to help employees reconcile their employment and family responsibilities. That is pretty high sounding stuff. As it reads, I would support it thoroughly, but goodness knows what it means in practice. How can an employer do some of these things if he is scratching to keep a business alive and cannot afford to be laying out money in this direction? It probably means the employer will close down earlier and lay off people quicker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have new certified agreement provisions for unionists. They add eight new tests to the tests which are already there. So an employer has got 16 steps now before he can even get to the very first certified agreement. That includes the no disadvantage tests. In effect, that means that an employer can have only the cherished flexibility that the minister talks about upwards; he cannot have the flexibility downwards. The union must be notified even if the employees of a workplace are not members of a trade union because they do not want to be members. The union has to be called in to look over their shoulders while they do whatever they have to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are new enterprise flexibility agreement provisions, designed to promote agreements in the non-union sector, in this bill. There are drawbacks in the existing mechanism. As a result, the provisions are hardly used at all. I think the Castle Bacon procedure is a classic example of that. But the new ones that have been put in place are at least as bad as the ones that exist now. I also predict that these provisions will not be used either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also establishes immunity for primary industrial action&mdash;that is the code word for strikes&mdash;taken during a bargaining period without a mechanism to bring intractable disputes to an end. To provide immunity while at the same time providing all the benefits for trade unions arising out of compulsory arbitration puts Australian trade unions in the most cosseted position of any trade union movement in the whole OECD. Why we want to go that way is quite beyond my comprehension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we have the industrial relations court&mdash;another layer of courts in this country. Until now we have had specialised industrial judges in the Federal Court. The system has worked reasonably well. But now we are to have labour courts&mdash;club courts, if you like&mdash;doing their special deals. There has been a long history in this country of specialised courts doing specialised deals. I think this is a bad move in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is all about protecting privilege of the industrial relations club, which I thought we were moving away from, protecting privilege of trade unions and, sadly, selling out Australia's sovereignty to the ILO and overseas powers. It is restricting access of employers, which they surely should have in a free country, to common law courts. It will only force up the cost of labour ultimately, and that will mean fewer jobs. There is nothing in this bill about lowering the on-costs of wages. New Zealand's on-costs are a third to a half of Australia's on-costs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having listened to the debate so far on the Industrial Relations Reform Bill and the Industrial Relations Court (Judges' Remuneration) Bill, with great respect I suggest that opposition members have read the scripts from the 1950s or maybe earlier. They have failed to absorb the fact that industrial relations practice in Australia has changed enormously. In recent years, that practice has become increasing dynamic in changing Australia's competitive position and the relationship between management and labour, and improving the general productivity and flexibility of trade union arrangements and activities within workplaces. Having listened to the debate, it seems that opposition members have simply been asleep while those changes have been occurring. That is a pity because the Industrial Relations Reform Bill represents a major reform. It builds upon a very substantial achievement in industrial relations over the last 10 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reading the reply to this legislation by the shadow minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), one gets the impression that nothing has been learned from the lead-up to the election and its result in March, when industrial relations was one of the key issues. The opposition has learned nothing. It has refused to acknowledge that people would not accept the decimation of unions, the complete dismantling of the award system, the $3 an hour wage arrangements or the wholesale attack on Australian employees&mdash;and nor should they because trade unions, and employees generally, across the country have been prepared to acknowledge the part they have to play in the rebuilding of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since October 1991, some 1,200 enterprise agreements have been ratified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Around 37 per cent of workers under federal awards are now party to those enterprise agreements, and that process is continuing. The bills, introduced by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), provide the scope for that strong reform and flexibility in the labour market to continue, but in a way that ensures that people are not worse off, that unions are not smashed to bits, and that people are not exploited in the way that the opposition's industrial relations policy apparently still proposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) made it clear that the opposition's principal objection to the bill is that it does not have the downward flexibility&mdash;it does not provide real cuts in the living standards and wages of working people. The opposition's basic agenda is downward flexibility. The government has made it clear that the acid test of its legislation is flexibility; enterprise agreements can be entered into but not without cutting the real living standards of working people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is about promoting productivity and ensuring fair conditions. However, the government also wants to ensure minimum conditions for workers and that the enlightened approach that is taken by large sections of management and the trade union movement is actually given some positive encouragement. </PARA>

Another employer, Mr Warburton from Du Pont, highlights what can be achieved when an enlightened approach is taken by employers working constructively with their employees and the unions to achieve productivity gains, flexibility and all the dynamics that are needed in the multiskilling of the work force to produce strong profit and export growth in the business enterprise. That can be achieved more strongly with these bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if we get into the position that the opposition wants to go back to, namely, a constant 1950s battle about industrial relations, the net result will be that the historically low levels of industrial disputation that we have today would be cast aside, as would the real unit labour costs and the competitive position we presently have in that regard. One has to wonder why the opposition would want to embark upon that course of action. What is it, apart from its blind ideology, that drives that sort of thinking?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go back over some of the major provisions of the industrial relations bill. Firstly, the new objects of the bill are designed to ensure a more effective framework for the maintenance and strengthening of the safety net for employees through the award system and minimum entitlements; secondly, more effective arrangements for direct bargaining, including the establishment of a new stream for enterprise flexibility agreements and the creation of a sanction-free bargaining pre-negotiation of certified agreements; a more effective regime for regulating industrial action and enforcing agreements, including amendments to the current secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act; the establishment of the specialist industrial court; and more effective institutional arrangements, including the encouragement of industry consultative councils, revised requirements for union registration, and the restructuring of the National Labour Consultative Council. </PARA>

The confrontationist style of industrial relations&mdash;for which the opposition so desperately hankers&mdash;would phenomenally increase industrial disputes, strikes and the losses that would occur as a result. Further, it is clear that the wages system has responded to the various demands in the community. Indeed, many unions have lead the way in multiskilling, restructuring workplaces, utilising technology and coping with the challenges of technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of us from time to time visit plants, factories and major enterprises in manufacturing and other areas and see both the constructive and cooperative arrangements at work. We talk to workers and management about what things used to be like in the old days. That change in attitude has been achieved through sensible, cooperative dialogue rather than by going back to smashing unions and exploiting young people&mdash;the confrontationist policy with which the opposition went to the last election. That package, which was so soundly rejected, is still part of the opposition's agenda, which is why it is so fiercely opposed to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What approach should be followed in the future? What sorts of things are needed in the future? Firstly, there needs to be a real award safety net protection. We do not accept the Kennett or Court approach to industrial relations, where a term such as `safety net' is a name-only concept that has no reality. The Kennett and Court governments have been about real cuts and the real lowering of conditions for working people. Once that safety net is done away with, there is scope for people to be exploited. There is no sensible and cooperative dialogue arrangement; rather, people are pitted one against the other, which causes damage which inevitably results in an ineffective award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, workers and unions have been voting with their feet and seeking to get out of those arrangements and under federal awards. So the protection and maintenance of the award safety net is fundamental to the legislation before the House&mdash;and it should be supported. The opposition should recognise that the policy it took to the election was unacceptable. No matter how much it protests now, the legislation will give more strength to those minimum conditions and the acceptance that we can have flexibility in wage arrangements. But we are not about flexibility down, which the honourable member for Parkes said should be in the legislation. We refuse absolutely to accept that. Victoria gives a clear example of why it is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can go across the Tasman to New Zealand. It has the sort of model that the opposition from time to time likes to boast about. We can see the impact in terms of employment in New Zealand because of the wholesale savaging of the industrial relations system. Has it created more jobs and more opportunities for people? The jobs performance in New Zealand under those changed and decimated industrial relations rules that now apply has been abysmal. We can go to other countries around our region or to other parts of the world to see what is happening with employment, and what sorts of industrial relations systems work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member may think that the sorts of conditions that apply in those countries under the social contract there should be advocated here&mdash;which is probably what the opposition does advocate&mdash;but I do not believe the people of Australia accept that at all. We believe in a proper safety net and a social contract that the accord brings into the system, and we believe that the basic minimum standards provided under the award system have to be protected fundamentally. That is what this legislation is designed to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move to what needs to be done. We recognise there is a case for flexibility and that the award safety net must be maintained. The enterprise flexibility clauses in awards allow individual enterprises or workplaces to reach agreements to vary individual conditions of the awards to suit their needs. Many awards already contain enterprise flexibility clauses. The legislation encourages their wider use and establishes some basic conditions for their application. These arrangements will help enterprises and workplaces to operate more efficiently. They will also make sure the interests of employees are properly taken into account so they are not disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enterprise flexibility clauses can be used for agreements which cover single issues such as hours of work, flexitime or wide ranging agreements. Changes negotiated through an enterprise flexibility clause must be taken to the commission for approval. These changes are implemented through award variations and generally operate as a schedule to the award. An application is made to the commission for an award variation. Each union will be able to be part of that process. That is not an unreasonable suggestion. There is scope to have that flexibility and the sorts of dynamics that an individual workplace might need but, at the same time, we should ensure that the Industrial Relations Commission does properly scrutinise it so there is a legitimacy in groups that have an interest in industry, taking those issues into account, and being part of that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time I have heard the opposition say there have been attacks from this side on the Industrial Relations Commission, but this legislation before the House is designed to ensure that it is meeting the contemporary needs of the community as far as labour relations are concerned but, at the same time, that it has the strength and teeth it needs to deal with those matters in a sensible and constructive way. The changes in this proposal enable that to occur in a sensible and ordered way. I think that will prove to be effective. It is happening already across a number of federal awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see in Queensland an increasing interest in enterprise agreements in a whole range of industries. There is value and virtue in having that ordered structure rather than the approach the opposition would take, which is basically about destroying trade unions. Those opposite have a philosophical problem with trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the new arrangement mean for women? It is important, when we introduce new industrial relations arrangements, that we recognise the particular needs of women and non-English speaking persons, and that we try to ensure, as far as we can through legislation,  that the Industrial Relations Commission gets value for those people, recognising&mdash;particularly in difficult economic times&mdash;the challenge that creates. In many parts of western Sydney and elsewhere, examples can be seen of people in traditional industries, particularly from non-English speaking backgrounds and women, in relation to part-time work&mdash;which is increasing&mdash;who do not have the protections the system logically should provide. This bill provides a number of positive things for those groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recognises that many women and workers from non-English speaking backgrounds are concerned about the effect that a more involved industrial relations system will have on their wages and conditions. The industrial relations reforms encourage enterprise bargaining while ensuring that workers are protected. The government has taken into account concerns raised by women's groups, community organisations and many others about the effect of the reforms on disadvantaged groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals before the House include an extensive range of safeguards to ensure fairness and equity for women and workers from non-English speaking backgrounds. The award system will be protected and strengthened as a prerequisite for enterprise bargaining. The safety net will be extended beyond the award system through minimum entitlements legislation giving effect to international conventions. This will guarantee rights for all workers to minimum wages, equal pay for men and women for work of equal value, protection against unfair dismissal and 12 months shared unpaid parental leave. The commission has to take into account the provisions of the International Labour Organisation convention in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told previously that, because we were taking account of those provisions that give certain guarantees to people such as women and those of non-English speaking backgrounds, that was denying the sovereignty of our nationhood. What could be further from the truth, when all we are trying to do is ensure some basic standards for all citizens and to recognise that some are in a stronger position than others to ensure that they get a fair go on such things as protection from unfair dismissal?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What possible reason could the opposition have for suggesting that that should not be supported? Whether it is in line with an international convention is surely not the issue. The principle is whether it is a proper consideration to be included in our bill, which it is. No-one can say that there should not be some protections against unfair dismissals. This is certainly in line with a proper international convention from the ILO. It is something that the parliament, not just the government, should support and see as a priority: to make sure that no person of non-English speaking background is disadvantaged or can be dismissed unfairly without some protective mechanism through the industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the House carries those protections in their proper form. It does not matter to what country those provisions are applied; the ILO convention is appropriate and it is entirely proper for Australia to be following that course. So the bill is an important step forward in industrial relations. It recognises what has been the very real commitment of trade unions to reform over recent years and the fact that labour relations have changed fundamentally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the opposition might still be in a time warp, the rest of Australia has moved on. Fortunately, management is generally more enlightened in its approach; and the nature of trade unions is fundamentally more enlightened in terms of flexibility in encouraging the range of opportunities that exist in multiskilling of the work force and so on. They have been able to undertake that change in attitude in a positive way with a dramatic reduction in the level of industrial disputes. I support the bill strongly. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I now happen to be in a situation where no-one picks fruit for me on an hourly rate because every member of the fruit-picking teams in the Riverland chooses to pick fruit on a contract basis. Why?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) for his accommodation. As I have indicated in my remarks on the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, in its input to this legislation the opposition seeks greater flexibility, not in order to pay people less&mdash;that has never been our intention&mdash;but in order to allow employers and employees to enter into mature negotiations to the benefit of both.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said it so eloquently in his opening remarks on this piece of legislation. He said simply: `Why don't people employ in Australia?'. It is not because there is a shortage of jobs, but because of what this legislation will do&mdash;introducing what he called, rather colourfully I thought, more `humbuggery' in the exercise of employing people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a representative of rural Australia, I happen to live in an area in which there are job opportunities, but these job opportunities are not being filled. Why? It is not because there are no people to do the work. Clearly that is not the case; the unemployment level is something over 11 per cent across Australia. More job opportunities are not being filled simply because, from the employers' point of view, there are too many risks in employing people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pick up the comments made in this debate by the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin). Last night the honourable member for Grey&mdash;who, as we all know, is a new member of this House&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I come from small business, fundamentally, and I have employed a few people from time to time. I reached a point probably seven or eight years ago where I could not afford to employ people. The hassle was simply too great . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What did he say? He did not say, `I had run out of work to do'. I have been to the small business of the honourable member for Grey; I know there are job opportunities there today. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hassle was simply too great and the margins too slim. I was in agriculture and we expect variations in business. However, the reality is, if employers are pushed too hard, if it is made too difficult for them to employ, and if incentives to employ are taken away, how in blazes are we going to get our young people back into work? Surely we should be looking at our employers and encouraging them as much as possible. Whether they are big, small or indifferent, right across the whole scale&mdash;particularly small business&mdash;surely we should be giving our employers every opportunity to employ. It is not just federal government, there are state governments involved in this as well.</PARA>
<PARA>Removing some of those disincentives to employment was what the honourable member for Grey was on about. That is what I am calling for tonight. That is what the coalition has been saying. The bill before the House is, if nothing else, most surely a disincentive to employment. Simply put, this bill makes employing people more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) said it: it strengthens the ILO power, it introduces and depends on United Nations conventions for its powers and it brings in a new rigidity to employment arrangements. As the honourable member for Bennelong stated earlier, it waters down sections 45D and 45E, moving them from the Trade Practices Act into the Industrial Relations Act. As honourable members are all aware, it provides that action will not be able to be taken under 45D or 45E without a 72-hour delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong made the point that 72 hours may be enough to send some small businesses broke, and I am sure he is right. Take an industry like my own&mdash;the fruit industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has this government shown any real concern for the unemployed? It certainly has not shown any real concern for making employing people easier. In fact, it has put disincentives in the way of all employers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government refuses to consider that. Instead, it would put in place the very legislation that is a disincentive for employers to employ people. The burden of payroll tax rose by 46 per cent from 1988 to 1992. It now takes one worker's pay for every 25 employed, and one worker's pay for every 15 in big business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been made tonight, in fact much has been made in this whole debate, of those businesses&mdash;quoted by honourable members opposite&mdash;that have been so successful as a result of the employee-employer arrangements they have entered into.

I note, though no-one from the government has said so, that they entered into these negations without the assistance of the legislation we are currently considering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than that, I happened to be at a meeting in the Barossa Valley two weeks ago where the chief executive officer of Amecon, part of the Transfield group that took over the discredited Melbourne dockyards, told us of the success it had had as a result of its employee-employer negotiations&mdash;negotiations entered into without this legislation; negotiations entered into as the majority of surviving small businesses still enter into their negotiations with their employees, without necessarily having union representation. We are not opposed to unions being a part of that negotiation, but I point out that the very success stories I have been familiar with in my electorate have occurred because employers and employees have been prepared to sit down together and come to a sensible agreement on what a wage package ought to be. Their negotiations have been entered into with the minimum of additional obligations placed on the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that I have witnessed, particularly in the last two parliaments, have been added burdens placed on employers by this government: the burden of this legislation, the burden of continuing the state imposition of payroll tax, the burden of superannuation, the burden of making it increasingly more difficult for employers to take on employees because their obligations exceed what reasonable obligations between two human beings ought to be and are all one way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by stressing this point. I have children who will very shortly be in the work force. I do not want them to be exploited; I do not want them to be in a situation where they are being used up by some other employer. But I do want them to have jobs. I do know that currently, as an employer, I am discouraged from employing people by the very volume of legislation and obligation that the government places on me.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the upper end of the tourist market where substantial amounts of money never reach the country, the backpacker expenditure, averaging around $3,500 per person spread over some three months stay, supports a range of locally owned small business throughout Australia. The most popular city is Sydney, followed by Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years the tourist industry has become threatened by the unfavourable worldwide publicity concerning the murder victims discovered at Bowral and, before that, with the burning to death of six backpackers in a hostel at Kings Cross. There is probably little that can be done in a general sense to avoid the repetition of the terrible murders but there is a great deal that can be done to avoid the firetraps, the overcrowded accommodation and the preying on backpackers by avaricious operators that have become a feature of this section of the tourist industry in the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hasten to add that there are many responsible businesses providing a cheap and excellent range of facilities throughout Australia. I am sure they would be the first to want to drive out those who have discredited the industry by their irresponsibility and avarice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sydney's low cost accommodation industry has long been notorious for its attraction to shadowy and marginal operators. Suspicions of arson, thuggery and overcrowded firetraps have been regular features. The Downunder Hostel where the six backpackers were burnt to death was partly owned by Abe Saffron, a notorious Sydney underworld figure who happened to own, directly or indirectly, six other premises that were burnt down or demolished by explosives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these problems have been facilitated by the authorities, who are supposed to monitor issues such as building and fire regulations, either by sins of omission, incompetence or worse. Since many firetraps have existed for years with the full knowledge of local government bodies and fire authorities, the inescapable conclusion is that certain owners are being protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the tragic Downunder fire in 1989 we saw belated handwringing and vows of closing the firetraps by premiers, mayors and fire brigade spokesmen around Australia. Mr Greiner in New South Wales urged a total review of local government powers. The New South Wales fire brigade sent a formal letter to every council and shire in the state. In Brisbane and Perth new legislation and fire regulations were proposed. In Darwin headlines said that the firetraps would be closed by the end of the month. Four years later, very little has been done judging by the performance in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate, the North Sydney Council has been clearly protecting the owner of a shocking firetrap at 41 Cremorne Road. Hostels such as the Backpackers Connection, Roslyn Street, Kings Cross; Aaronbrook Lodge, Brook Street, Coogee; Coogee Beach Backpackers, Beach Street, Coogee; Grand Pacific, Beach Street, Coogee; Indys Beachside Backpackers, Arden Street, Coogee; Manly Guest House, Whistler Street, Manly; Excelsior Hotel, Foveaux Street, Surrey Hills; Regent Street Hotel, Sydney; Australian Sunrise Lodge, King Street, Newtown; Thelellen Beach Inn, Campbell Parade, Bondi; Working Holiday Visa Flats, Illawong Avenue, Bondi; the Bondi Beach Guest House, Consett Avenue, Bondi&mdash;and no doubt many others&mdash;are all subject to overcrowding and gross breaches of fire regulations to varying degrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All have been known to the New South Wales fire brigade and to the respective councils for years. Why has nothing effective been done? Why are they allowed to continue to trade? Why are some owners whipped with a feather by council inspectors when other establishments have had the book thrown at them? Given the nature of some of the owners, and the fact that the difference between a hard and easy inspection is often a quarter of a million dollars, obviously some owners are being protected by council incompetence or by bribery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Visitors to this country have a right to expect proper conditions and standards of fire safety. Australia's reputation as a tourist destination has been and is continuing to be damaged. I urge the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) to bring this matter to the attention of state ministers responsible for tourism, local government and fire authorities, requesting that backpacker accommodation unfit for occupation be closed immediately and not permitted to re-open until the necessary work is implemented. The buck passing and protection that have characterised this industry for years must end. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly about a topic that touches all our lives more deeply than we often imagine, yet is very little discussed in this place. Urban design has recently been given prominence by the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that he has commissioned a task force of eminent professionals to examine the forces that are shaking our cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Urban design has not generally been the business of government at any level in Australia. Australians have not traditionally been good at it, despite the presence from time to time of designers with international recognition. It emerges as a matter of public debate intermittently and unexpectedly, driven by individuals of vision, and it is always refreshing and exciting. The urban and regional review announced by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) is dealing with strategic aspects of this issue. The Prime Minister's new urban design task force will focus on some of its tactical aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Urban designers have devoted their efforts mainly to the centres of our cities. The fringes have often been neglected because, being diffuse and lacking concentrated urban centres, they are relatively unattractive to designers and very few of them live and work there. The centre is always there but time spent in contemplation at the fringe sees whole fields disappearing under houses in a matter of months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is vital that the new urban design task force give much attention to these neglected edges of our big cities. Urban design is important to the articulate inhabitants of the centres. It is also important to the next generation that is growing up on the outskirts of the city because, as Winston Churchill observed, `We shape our buildings but thereafter they shape us'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now briefly show how all this bears upon parts of my electorate of Macquarie. The traditional pattern of development produced many towns of great character that survived relatively intact until the postwar boom. Subsequent development pressures have fragmented them but some very fine urban centres remain. These places are threatened now by the type of development that flourishes naturally at the fringes where land is relatively cheap and, on superficial analysis, plentiful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Huge tracts of low density cottage suburbs are served by shopping barns that stand in hectares of asphalt paving. Fragments of degraded bushland or mortally wounded farmland are surrounded and sterilised. Our most precious and irreplaceable resource, land, is being squandered. In architectural terms, we are creating vast paddocks of unrelated individual buildings with very few communal places. I fear that such development has social implications that can be described in similar terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Macquarie, the clash between the spreading city and the surviving natural environment is of paramount concern. Urban design here must have a set of determinants quite different from those that operate in the old parts of the city. It is necessary here to preserve areas of remnant bushland to establish zones and precincts that protect river banks and catchments. It is necessary that there be provision in new developments for the urban forests and wetlands that can purify waste water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is necessary that rural and agricultural landscapes of high scenic quality be respected for their intrinsic as well as their economic value. It is necessary that the very great heritage value of some of the early towns be zealously guarded. All these things should be directly affecting the way in which we are now designing and building our towns and suburbs. There are many attempts under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Urban design studies and mainstreet programs are being commissioned and supported by councils that frequently find themselves in unfamiliar territory, exposed to criticism from conservative sections of their constituencies that believe exclusively in rates, roads and rubbish. There is often extreme pressure from impatient and hungry land developers that forces planning and urban design policies to be formulated on the run. Councils often find difficulty in reconciling the business of thoughtful urban design and integrated forward planning with local government's long tradition of simply reacting to proposals submitted by developers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the issues of urban design arising on the fringes of our cities are distinctly different from, but just as important as, those that arise in the city centres and that so often seem to be much more exciting and engaging for professional designers. I believe that those engaged with urban design on the fringes of our cities have an important task, that they deserve recognition and much support. I have high hopes that the work of the new urban design task force will provide a significant part of that support. I commend the Prime Minister for this initiative. </PARA>
