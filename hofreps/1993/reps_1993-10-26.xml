<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Special Minister of State. I refer the minister to the statement by the head of the Australian Mining Industry Council, Mr Lauchlan McIntosh, that the government's proposed Mabo legislation is `unworkable, inequitable and will be damaging to the economic welfare of all Australians'. Is this the same legislation described by the Prime Minister last week as a good bill for the mining industry and as a win for the mining industry and the result of the government having found what he described as common ground in the national interest? Now that the attempt to mislead the mining industry has clearly failed, will the government take the advice offered yesterday by the industry and go back to the drawing board to find a system that will work for all Australians?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I can say is that AMIC has had total access to the ministry in its negotiations. There has never been a complaint that it has not been consulted with. I have always met with it on every occasion it has sought to do so. It has had many meetings with the Prime Minister's staff and with other ministers and their staff. It has known all along the direction the government was taking.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has always known. Until very recently, after full and detailed examination of it all, there was only one matter that it was concerned about, and consistently concerned about, and that was the question of revival of native title after the expiration of a mining lease. It has always objected to that. It still objects to that. It does not like it at all. It thinks that that is inappropriate. The government has been saying that there are no problems in regard to the mining profession and the mining industry with the freehold or leasehold land being mined then reverting back to the freeholder or leaseholder. So far as Aboriginal people are concerned, there is objection on the part of AMIC, and it is an objection we do not accept. I think most decent Australians do not object. However, having agreed to all the mechanisms and procedures within the bill and found them to be reasonable, it now finds that its friends in the Liberal Party are in grave trouble. The ugly face of the Liberal Party is now very clear to Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the weekend I noticed one of Australia's leading journalists asking, `How low can the Liberals go?'. I think Bronwyn Bishop answered that yesterday: there are still new depths, much deeper depths, to which the Liberals will descend before this debate is over. All I can say is that the secret agenda, of course, is not Mabo at all; it is the leadership of the Liberal Party as each one of the contenders claw over one another's backs just to show how ugly and how despicable they can be in this particular debate. I can give the Leader of the Opposition a bit of advice: Bronwyn will do him every day. She leads the faction in the New South Wales Liberal Party which prides itself in the name&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Speaker. The substance of the question concerned AMIC's newfound belief&mdash;Lauchlan McIntosh's newfound view&mdash;that, despite its previous understandings and assurances, because the Liberal Party is now in trouble this is all unworkable, inequitable and damaging to the Australian economy. All I can say is this: our belief is that it is very workable. It is the best possible solution for this nation. All honourable members have to do if they do not believe that is look at the alternative. The alternative that is being put forward by Richard Court and by the federal Liberal Party in Australia is to have a referendum in this country to take away from Aborigines the rights that were given to them and to wipe off the statue books the Racial Discrimination Act&mdash;in other words, to have a racist referendum.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Liberal Party feels that its referendum is wrongly described as racist, then I withdraw it. The unworkable situation would be the one that is now being proposed by Richard Court in this country; that is, for the states to extinguish wholesale native title without compensation and without due process, which would lead to a decade at least of interminable, vicious and divisive litigation in this country that would freeze the mining industry, that would freeze development in this country, that would bankrupt the state of Western Australia and would put Australia's economic development back many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the alternative that the Liberals are offering, and certainly I have seen no positive suggestions from the Australian Mining Industry Council that are different from the government's proposals, except for the proposition about the revival of native title after a mining lease expires.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a nice question from the honourable member for Lilley, because it provides me with an opportunity to inform the House of the success of the government's budget strategy, as confirmed by the Senate in the early hours of Friday morning. It was at that moment, at about 2 a.m. on Friday, that the parliament affirmed what the government had set out to do in this budget, and that, in the context of a deficit reduction strategy, was to give effect to our election commitments, including the bringing forward of the provision and, as it turned out, the first instalment of the tax cuts which will now, as I had announced, be delivered as from 15 November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great compliment to the parliament that it was able to endorse what was, in any terms, an ambitious strategy to ensure that the government could maintain an appropriate stimulus to the economy now, when it was necessary, whilst at the same time locking in a strategy which will bring the budget deficit down to around 1.2 per cent of GDP in 1996-97. I want to take this opportunity to thank those who have endorsed and enacted this strategy because of the way in which it gives confidence to both the financial markets and the business community generally in this country in the plans that they can now make, knowing that the government will be borrowing less in the future, and therefore ensuring that there will be an attractive climate for investment in Australia over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who come out of this process worst off are those who sit opposite. On 31 August, when the question arose about how this was going to pass the parliament, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have spoken to people who are worth talking to, and that ain't those opposite and, as a result, our budget will pass the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>It has, and what has occurred is that the Liberal and National parties emerged from this whole saga without any victories and without any honour either. They set out to emasculate the budget&mdash;to reject at least four of the major revenue measures which were a crucial part of this deficit reduction strategy. They ended up not defeating one of them. Not one of the revenue measures was defeated in the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even though some amendments were made in the Senate, we will end up collecting 97 per cent of the revenue which we intended to raise through those new revenue measures. So, it is 97 to the government and zero to the opposition, because its objective was to defeat&mdash;not amend&mdash;those measures and it defeated not one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an ambitious objective that we set ourselves but it was also an important one for Australia in terms of our economic advancement in the future. We now have the opportunity, in the context of an economy which is strengthening, to take advantage of that strengthening as the government reduces its call on the resources of the nation and allows the private sector to get on with what it can do best&mdash;to invest in Australia and to employ people here. The opposition is the party that believes&mdash;at least it says it does&mdash;in small deficits, yet everything it did was in the opposite direction. It has lost any sense of perspective, any sense of credibility, and any sense of honour.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am certainly going to read the quotations. The High Court made it very clear that the Mabo decision is not restricted to the tiny island of Mer in the Torres Strait. Let me quote from the leading judgment of Justice Brennan:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And there may be other areas of Australia where native title has not been extinguished and where an Aboriginal people, maintaining their identity and customs, are entitled to enjoy their native title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was with some disbelief that I heard the Leader of the Opposition tell ABC radio this morning that he was not convinced that native title was transferable to the mainland. Let me quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court has established that native title was found to exist on one of the three Murray Islands in the Torres Strait&mdash;and we accepted that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The solution of the Mabo problem has involved looking at structures that would facilitate the determination of whether or not native title does transfer to the mainland.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the interview he was asked whether he was not certain that native title exists on mainland Australia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We don't know the extent to which it transfers to the mainland.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's approach has been predicated on the fact that native title does transfer to the mainland. The Leader of the Opposition's interpretation flies in the face of any sensible legal interpretation of the High Court's decision. It makes mockery of the coalition's June statement on Mabo which said that native title had to be recognised and a fair procedure found to deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Key Liberal Party officials are obviously becoming concerned by the Leader of the Opposition's increasingly erratic behaviour. Today the federal vice-president of the Young Liberals, Ross McClymont, said that the Liberal Party needed to be constructive and put an end to uncertainty over Mabo. He told ABC radio that there was a danger that the Liberal Party would be seen as `spoilers', unable to make a positive contribution. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality is it's too important an issue to be sidetracked by Federal/ State rivalry or by Party politics.</PARA>
<PARA>As Mr McClymont suggests, this spoiling game is becoming pathetic. The government has negotiated a package which will provide a measure of justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, while making certain that the principles of economic management and land use remain workable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's position has been clear&mdash;the government has been concerned with safeguarding economic interests and protecting justice for Aboriginal people&mdash;whereas we have the Leader of the National Party talking about the dispossession of Aboriginal people being inevitable, the honourable member for Flinders suggesting that the High Court's decision discriminates against non-Aboriginals, and Senator Bronwyn Bishop arguing for a referendum, so that&mdash;</PARA>

And we have said that it will be a matter, in terms of negotiations with the states and the leveraging that we say to the states if they expect to get Commonwealth funding there has to be a consistent approach, of the states taking proper account of the new dimension to title that the High Court's decision has brought forward.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question and her continuing interest in this area. Perhaps like a number of honourable members in the chamber, I have read with interest the comments by the mining industry lobby groups&mdash;in particular, the comments by the Australian Mining Industry Council and the Chamber of Mines of WA (Inc) in recent days&mdash;some of which have been critical of the government's Mabo proposal. I must say that I have found some of these comments puzzling when contrasted with some of the comments made by the chief executives of some of our mining companies. I will get back to that in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key worry about the Mabo High Court decision, if we believe what the mining industry has put out in the past, has been its concern about uncertainty which we believe will be removed by our proposed legislation. There are many reasons why the mining industry should not only welcome the proposals that we have announced but also be working hard to convince the Liberal and National Party opposition at the federal level and the Liberal Party at the state level throughout the country to support the measures that we are putting forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I am puzzled is that this morning I got out a copy of a pamphlet put out in June of this year by the Australian Mining Industry Council. In this pamphlet, AMIC listed eight points that it wanted satisfied by the government's legislation. Under the points, the mining industry put its position. I will quickly run through the eight points for the information of the House, given the interest in this matter. Under the first point, the mining industry said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mining industry recognises that native title exists where the conditions established by the High Court are satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA>Our bill is consistent with this view. So the first point gets a tick. The second point was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments should move expeditiously and cooperatively to validate existing conventional titles to land.</PARA>
<PARA>The bill does that, so the second point gets a tick. The third point AMIC made in its pamphlet was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Procedures should be put in place to register claims for native title with a `sunset' date being determined in order that uncertainty will not persist indefinitely.</PARA>
<PARA>The bill will do that without a sunset clause, so there is a qualified tick on the third point. The fourth point was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Court processes should be employed to determine the validity of claims and the rights attaching to successful claims.</PARA>
<PARA>So on that point, again, our legislation satisfies that concern. The fifth point was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States to continue to grant and validate mining and exploration leases while claims for native title are being processed.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Native title holders whose enjoyment of the title is disturbed would be entitled to compensation.</PARA>
<PARA>Our proposed legislation ensures that this will occur in some circumstances. While some additional protections are being afforded to registered native title claimants, grants of interest over land will continue to be able to be processed. So, there is a qualified tick on that point. On the next point AMIC said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from living areas and sites of special significance&mdash;the mining industry argued&mdash;there would be no right of veto by native title holders over mining or exploration.</PARA>
<PARA>It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Native title holders so affected would be entitled to compensation, as are other landowners in similar circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>Our bill proposes for the right of negotiation as currently exists for other leaseholders under state procedures but no right of veto. So, again, we have satisfied that point. The seventh point was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As determined by the High Court, native title cannot be revived after extinguishment.</PARA>
<PARA>This seems to be the only stumbling block&mdash;the only major difference&mdash;between us and the mining industry, if honourable members believe AMIC's pamphlet of June this year. The reason why there is a difference is that it is wrong. The High Court did not rule that mining leases or exploration licences extinguish native title. It was silent on this question. Under the general law, a mining lease or exploration licence can be issued over leasehold land&mdash;or even over your land, Mr Speaker. That exploration licence or mining lease is superior to the original leasehold or freehold title. The mining interest overrides the interest of the existing owner for the period of the mining operation. At the end of that mining operation, the interests of the original owner are restored. This bill proposes similar arrangements for native title holders. So, on this one major point of difference between the government and the mining industry, we believe that our position is eminently justifiable. On the eighth point AMIC argued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Crown ownership of minerals must be retained for the benefit of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>The bill confirms this point. So, on the eight points which AMIC said was its position back in June, the government has given a tick to six, a qualified tick to the seventh, and AMIC was wrong on the eighth point&mdash;it was a furphy. It is rather difficult to understand some of the concerns that have been expressed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, last Friday morning during the adjournment, the honourable member for Macarthur referred to the Western Australian government, Premier Court and his father, Sir Charles Court, as `the last bastion of white supremacy'. In light of the fact that Premier Richard Court has an adopted Aboriginal daughter now aged approximately 18 years, whom he raised for an extended time as a single parent, and considering the fact that at no time has Premier Court, his father or relatives ever identified this situation, even in their own defence of allegations of this nature, would you call upon the honourable member for Macarthur to withdraw this unsubstantiated imputation of racism?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe it is within my power to request the honourable member for Macarthur to withdraw that comment in this place because it does not refer to a member of this House. However, in reference to the issue which has been raised by the honourable member for O'Connor, it seems that often in recent times in the heat of debate statements have been made about people who do not have the opportunity to defend themselves which, in some instances, can cause grave offence. I would ask honourable members on both sides to have cognisance of those particular concerns in debates in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Mr Speaker, on two occasions in recent times, and as recently as today, when a minister has been asked by the opposition to table documents, you have broadened that definition, it seems to me, quite significantly by asking the minister whether the documents were personal. It is very clear that it does not matter whether the documents are personal or not, and I hope that there has not been a subtle shift in the application of that standing order. I ask you to have a look at those questions that you have asked and to reassure the House that there has been no change in the interpretation of that standing order.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time as Dr Hewson sits mute on the issue&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is apparently a quote from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Peter Reith attacks the legitimacy of the High Court and threatens it . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is misrepresentation No. 1. If the Prime Minister cares to read my speech, he will see that that is a plain misrepresentation. I will continue to quote the article. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . reportedly saying if it continues to behave this way it will be reformed . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Again, my speech did not in fact say it would be reformed. I said that it would attract unwelcome controversy and invite measures for reform. This is a clear misrepresentation. If the Prime Minister wants to read my speech and quote from it, he ought to do it accurately. The third misrepresentation is when the Prime Minister was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and arguing any preference for Aborigines in the Native Title Bill should be struck out.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very clear misrepresentation. To refute the misrepresentation, I quote from the words referring to the bill which I uttered on the weekend:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The special measures are discriminatory. They are not necessary, in a legal sense, to deal with Mabo. As Mr. Keating boasts, they provide special advantages to Aborigines. Now this may sometimes be justified but such proposals have to be judged carefully.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) is an omnibus tax bill which amends the tax law in a number of respects. The principal amendments deal with the deferral of the initial payment of company tax, a tax exemption for non-profit tourist industry promoters, a sales tax exemption for the RSPCA, dividend imputation, income tax deductions for life insurance companies, capital gains tax treatment of life assurance policies, petroleum mining provisions, fringe benefits tax, resources rent tax and the superannuation guarantee charge. A number of minor technical amendments are also made. We will effectively be prevented from debating amendments which, I understand, are to be moved by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) at some later stage in these proceedings, and that is to be regretted. Those issues deal with deductions for the cost of establishing grapevines, sales tax application of penalties and sales tax exemption for child-care services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those three issues cannot be debated under standing orders because they are not before the chamber. With the guillotine on, we will not have the opportunity to discuss those matters. We are also debating cognately the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Amendment Bill, which makes changes consequential to the amendments contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the measures contained in these bills, the coalition is most concerned with the proposed changes to the petroleum mining provisions. These changes are designed to close a loophole in the existing law which allows oil and gas companies to claim tax deductions on expenditure incurred in their tax exempt offshore mining, quarry and exploration activities. As a general principle, tax deductions cannot be claimed for expenditure in deriving tax exempt income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The technical defect in the existing law, which Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) seeks to correct, allows mining companies to claim a deduction in Australia for expenditure incurred offshore, notwithstanding the fact that income from the offshore operations is not taxable in Australia. Every company in Australia involved in offshore oil and gas exploration is affected by these measures. The coalition's principal concern with this measure is that it is to be given retrospective effect from 7.30 p.m. on 21 August 1990&mdash;three years ago&mdash;the date on which the law was amended to give rise to this defect in the law. This is an outrageous proposal, not just because its retrospectivity is completely at odds with the principle of the rule of law but also because the proposed retrospective amendment is designed to cover up the downright incompetence of the Australian Taxation Office and the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The technical defect arose as a result of 1991 amendments to the tax law which deleted the words `in Australia' from the relevant provisions in the principal act. On two separate occasions, the effect of the 1991 amendments was raised with the Taxation Office by tax professionals through the regular consultative channels. The first occasion was at a meeting of the foreign income measures subcommittee of the National Taxation Liaison Group on 26 September 1991. At that meeting the Australian Taxation Office representatives gave an undertaking to tax practitioners that the issue would be examined. At a second meeting of the same committee held on 2 February 1992, representatives of the Taxation Office again advised that the issue was still under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of these two meetings was that tax professionals took the entirely reasonable view that the tax  office had accepted that the law would operate according to the legislation as it then was and as it currently stands. Eighteen months later, on 4 August this year, the Assistant Treasurer issued a press release announcing the retrospective change to the tax law contained in this bill&mdash;a change that is completely at odds with the failure of the Taxation Office to correct the defect through the usual channels. The result is that taxpayers stand to be retrospectively disadvantaged as a result of their strict adherence with the law and despite their best efforts to clarify the law through the regular consultative processes with the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implications of this retrospective measure go beyond the disadvantage to be inflicted on these particular taxpayers. The implications extend to the integrity of the tax consultative process with the Australian Taxation Office. The government has used the goodwill and cooperation of taxpayers in this process to attack the rights of affected taxpayers through retrospective changes to the tax law. By acting retrospectively to the detriment of taxpayers, the ATO will effectively ensure that tax professionals will not in future raise matters of substance through consultative channels. When this happens the entire consultative process will break down to the detriment of the administration of tax law in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to tax practitioners, in a letter sent to the Assistant Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer was not informed&mdash;perhaps through an oversight&mdash;that the tax office had not acted on representations by tax professionals when he made the decision to make this retrospective change to the tax law. They have, accordingly, called on the government to review and to reverse that particular decision. Unfortunately, the fact that we are debating this measure here today indicates that the Assistant Treasurer has ignored these appeals from tax practitioners. The result is that taxpayers will get the rough end of the stick to save the Taxation Office from embarrassment. The Taxation Office is prepared to wreck the consultative process with taxpayers and to undermine the operation of the rule of law in this country rather than admit that it has made a mistake in the drafting of the original law and to wear the consequences for the revenue which, we understand, amounts to $1 billion, although that is according to the government&mdash;and it generally overstates these figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Problems are compounded by the fact that the ATO has apparently issued several private rulings to individual taxpayers confirming that the expenses concerned are deductible. Either the government is proposing to overturn these private rulings through its retrospective legislation, which would be a disaster for tax administration, or it is proposing to treat taxpayers differently in identical circumstances, which means that the principle of equality before the law is to be thrown out the window. The government is walking all over the rights of taxpayers in this matter, with grave implications for the administration of tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation was summed up by Mr Alf Capito, tax partner of Arthur Andersen, quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 6 August this year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax office has realised now there is a problem and is solving it by introducing retrospective legislation to cover its own incompetence . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because they suspected a flaw in the legislation, many mining companies acting in good faith sought advice from tax experts, who advised their clients of the law as it stood at the time.</PARA>
<PARA>Now the law has been changed and companies which acted legally at the time have to suffer financially because of a fault which had been pointed out to the ATO two years ago. That is it in a nutshell, as related by Mr Capito. Accordingly, the coalition will move an amendment to this bill in the committee stage to remove its retrospective effect. The amendment will read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 18, page 5, omit the clause, substitute the following clause:</PARA>

The amendments made by this Division apply in relation to expenditure incurred after 7.30 p.m., by standard time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 August 1990 which has not been claimed as a deduction in a return furnished to the Commissioner prior to 5 August 1993.".</PARA>

<PARA>The amendment will ensure that the government's changes to the tax law will have effect only from 4 August 1993, the date on which the government announced its decision to close the self-inflicted loophole. The actions of the government and the ATO in this matter are simply unconscionable and the amendment accordingly deserves the support of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is only one of several retrospective measures that the government has resorted to in recent years and the frequency seems to be on the increase. Only a few weeks ago we were asked to approve a retrospective customs tariff measure which sought to take away the rights of certain importers to a refund of customs duty to which they may have been entitled at law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's actions in relation to the administration of taxation do much to prove the truth of Sir Harry Gibbs's assessment of the Australian taxation system in an address he gave to the 11th national convention of the Taxation Institute of Australia as recently as May of this year. Sir Harry is Chairman of the Australian Taxation Research Foundation and has an abiding interest in the subject of tax reform. His speech to the national convention of the Taxation Institute earlier this year is a 30-page indictment of Labor's tax system. Sir Harry refers to Professor Parsons's comparison of the tax law to a supernova as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a star which in its death throes undergoes a dramatic increase in size and intensity before finally collapsing.</PARA>
<PARA>After noting the massive uncertainty that currently prevails in the administration of the tax system, Sir Harry stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation which has effects such as this is quite unacceptable in a democratic society.</PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about the Australian tax system. He went on to observe:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not an exaggeration to say that the Income Tax Assessment Act is obscure and uncertain in its operation, it is burdensome to comply with and to prevent avoidance it resorts to heavy penalties and to discretions so wide as to make it a gamble for a taxpayer to endeavour, quite legitimately, to reduce tax payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a law reflects no credit on the society which tolerates it.</PARA>
<PARA>Nor, might I add, does it reflect credit on the parliament that legislates that law in the first place. Sir Harry Gibbs's comments are supported by figures gathered by the tax office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer in particular to a study by the Dandenong branch of the ATO into compliance levels among personal taxpayers selected for audit. This study found that 100 per cent of taxpayers audited filed incorrect returns in relation to lump sum payments, eligible termination payments and capital gains tax. The error rates for dry-cleaning expenses, uniforms, clothing, gifts, tools and superannuation were all between 91 and 99 per cent. The average additional tax payable on eligible termination payments after audits was $7,200. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That underlines the fact that the tax system is so complex, to the point of incomprehensibility, that ordinary people are unable to comply with it. Honourable members cannot tell me that 100 per cent of taxpayers in certain categories, or between 91 and 99 per cent of taxpayers in other categories, deliberately set out to avoid or evade tax. They cannot understand what they are required to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will recall that similar results have been obtained with the fringe benefits tax, where the average adjustment as a result of an audit is in the vicinity of $52,000. We have also seen the ATO's large case audit program allegedly net massive amounts in unpaid tax from major Australian companies, reflecting the massive level of uncertainty about the payment of company tax under existing law. Significantly, a major proportion of these funds is subject to legal challenge by the companies concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Corporate Tax Association, 30 per cent of the $1.14 billion in additional company tax assessed by the tax office as a result of the large case audit program is being challenged in the courts. The ATO has collected only one-sixth of the $4.64 billion that was initially claimed by the ATO as having been netted by the large case audit program. These figures confirm a tax system which is out of all control and needs to be brought to heel. Mr Bob Bryant of the Corporate Tax Association is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's corporate tax system is beginning to crumble under the weight of its own complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is not an understatement. Legislation such as that we have before us today, and the proposed changes to the petroleum mining provisions in particular, do not give us any confidence that the deficiencies are being addressed by Labor. Its so-called tax simplification project has so far failed to materialise. If anything, the tax law has become even more complex since the simplification exercise was first announced. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)condemns the Government for its inefficient handling of the changes relating to the taxation of offshore petroleum exploration activities; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)calls on the Government to ensure that companies which have lodged returns in accord with the existing provisions relating to offshore petroleum exploration activities are not penalised retrospectively".</PARA>
<PARA>The remaining provisions of these two bills give the coalition no cause for great concern and we will not be opposing them accordingly. The deferral of the initial payment of company tax for the 1993-94 year of income for companies with a tax liability of less than $300,000, and which pay their tax in two instalments, is a welcome measure. It should be remembered, however, that the government has done much to bring forward the payment of company tax during its time in office, and so we should not look upon the measure as any great concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grant of a sales tax exemption to the RSPCA is an appropriate measure, although it does point to the ongoing problems of anomalies with sales tax concessions. There are other organisations engaged in equally worthy activities which do not enjoy an exemption, and there is really no basis for their different tax treatment, other than that the government has made provision for one of these organisations but not for the others. We do not begrudge the RSPCA its tax exemption, but we would point out that the sales tax system by its very nature does not treat taxpayers equally and thereby violates what should be an important principle of tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two bills contain important changes to the imputation system as a result of the reduction in the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent for 1993-94 and later years of income. The changes allow companies to pass on to shareholders the full value of any imputation credits for tax paid at the old 39 per cent rate by using dual franking accounts rather than the existing single franking account. Without these amendments, the value of the 39 per cent imputation credits would be reduced when passed on to individual shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also deals with provisions relating to the income tax deductions allowable to life assurance companies. Currently, life assurance companies are disadvantaged by a requirement to include in their taxable income the tax liability of a superannuation fund, which is an unintended effect of the existing legislation. The bill amends the relevant formulae for the calculation of the tax liability of life assurance companies so that these amounts will no longer be included in their assessable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments are also made to the capital gains tax treatment of life assurance policies. These particular amendments are designed to ensure that capital gains from life assurance policies realised by superannuation funds are treated in the same way as the general concessional treatment of these funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capital gains tax provisions will no longer apply to capital gains&mdash;or losses&mdash;realised on the disposal of life assurance policies, or rights under such policies, by complying superannuation funds, ADFs, and PSTs, regardless of whether the fund or trust is the original beneficial owner of the policy. This exemption will apply to disposals after 1 July 1988, which also makes these amendments retrospective in their effect. However, since these amendments will serve to confer a small benefit, the coalition has no fundamental objection to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes changes that serve to retain the existing provisional tax uplift factor at eight per cent. The eight per cent uplift factor is applied to income for 1992-93 for the purposes of calculating provisional tax for 1993-94. The provisional tax system, however, is a particularly contentious imposition on taxpayers, and it is made more so by the uplift element. This is despite the fact that it has been reduced from 10 per cent to eight per cent in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely, the existing rate for the provisional tax uplift factor needs to be reconsidered. Interest rates and inflationary expectations have fallen considerably since the eight per cent figure was set, and there is no sign yet that interest rates have bottomed. The uplift factor is applied in a completely indiscriminate way, which assumes that the provisional taxpayer's income will increase by the percentage stipulated, when in fact that income could rise or fall by an amount well outside the eight per cent range. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way to mitigate the effect of the uplift factor is by applying for a provisional tax variation from the ATO. But this does not really help the situation, since it greatly increases the exposure of taxpayers to penalties and back taxes if they should misjudge their likely non-exertion income for the financial year ahead. Such penalties can easily wipe out the benefits of a possible provisional tax variation, so many people are trapped into paying provisional tax, and will have to recoup any overpaid tax at the end of the financial year. Any provisional tax uplift factor will inevitably be an arbitrary imposition. The only way in which the arbitrariness can be reduced is if it is kept at the lowest possible rate, and if taxpayers are given a fair margin of error in calculating a provisional tax variation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes some changes to the petroleum resources rent tax law, to ease compliance with the law and to prevent the distortion of commercial decision making where there is a change of interests in a project. These amendments will treat the transfer of part of a taxpayer's interest in a petroleum project in the same way as transfers of a taxpayer's whole interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exploration expenditure incurred in one project will become offsettable against assessable receipts from other projects, or against assessable receipts derived by another company in the same wholly owned company group. Exploration expenditure incurred in the financial year in which a person abandons a petroleum project can be offset against receipts from other projects. The amendments also increase the time available for the lodgment of expenditure transfer notices and for the lodgment of the annual petroleum resource rent tax returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes some minor changes to fringe benefits tax provisions to reflect the effects of the deregulation of domestic aviation in Australia over the last few years. Under the existing arrangements, a fringe benefit for airline transport arises when an airline operator, or travel agent, provides transport to an employee.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxable value of this benefit is the stand-by value of the transport provided, less any contribution made by an employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the stand-by value is calculated with reference to the economy air fare of either the provider of the service or Australian Airlines. The amendments mean that no particular airline will now be referred to for FBT valuation purposes. References to Australian Airlines are no longer appropriate for a number of reasons, but particularly given the changes that have taken place in recent years to the domestic passenger market in Australia. Where an airline has a published economy air fare different in value from a non-published economy air fare, only the published fare will be used for valuation purposes. The bill also removes the requirement for certain employers to disclose the sources of information used in the compilation of their fringe benefit tax return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the bill essentially has the support of the coalition. Many of the measures contained in the bill are concessional in nature, with the one exception that I have already mentioned concerning the retrospective element of the proposed changes to the petroleum mining provisions. As I said, amendments in my name have been distributed, one of which will be moved in the committee stage, and one which is relevant to the second reading debate. I conclude by saying that the coalition does not support the retrospective change proposed, and I enjoin honourable members to support the coalition amendment when it is brought before the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a debate on a very large number of amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Amendment Bill but, rather than canvass any number of those topics, I would like to concentrate on chapter four, the deductions allowable to life assurance companies. This has been the cause of some correspondence and debate between the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, representing the life insurance industry, and the government over a number of months. We resolved one thing in particular that was sought by LIFA in a sense, in its favour. We also resolved a second matter, not necessarily in its favour&mdash;it may not agree&mdash;so I would like to explain how we reached our particular decision on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to explain the various and different rates at which life assurance companies are taxed. This is really a debate about which streams of money will be taxed at what level and whether we can adjust the contributions in each tax stream so that life assurance companies, unlike most other taxpayers, have separate classes of assessable income arising from the various types of business in which they are engaged. There are four classes of income, each taxed at a different rate. The relevant classes and rates of tax are: first, the non-complying superannuation class, which is assessable at 47 per cent; second, the complying superannuation and rollover annuity class, which is assessable at 15 per cent; third, the accident disability residual life assurance class, which is assessable at 39 per cent; and, fourth, a non-fund class, where non-mutual company taxes are assessable at 33 per cent and mutual company taxes are assessable at 39 per cent. These unique factors make it necessary to allocate or apportion deductions to the particular class of assessable income so that the overall tax liability of the company may be determined. This calculation and apportionment of some deductions are achieved through formulas in the tax law. There is discussion of these formulas as part of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two amendments in particular, which the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) announced as at 31 May, intend to make certain changes to the formulas. These are that transferred superannuation contributions, what are known as section 275 amounts, no longer be treated as assessable income for the purposes of the formulas and, second, that the apportionment formula would include as assessable income superannuation premiums and the investment component of ordinary life insurance premiums. These are the two amendments which are included in the bill, and they were introduced on 29 September this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of those amendments was requested by the Life Insurance Federation of Australia. We agree that that is a reasonable request, and we have produced the amendment. LIFA is not keen on the second one, however, and it thinks that our amendment will be detrimental to life insurance companies. In essence, it considers that the amendment unfairly directs a larger proportion of deductions to the lower taxed superannuation class of business. I want to respond to this because it is our view that LIFA is seeking to inject a degree of complexity here that will only make things more difficult all round. We have sought an amendment which maintains the simplicity of the system which, after all, is what industry is continually seeking us to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second amendment is designed so that the deductions allocated to each class of business of a life insurance company better reflect the expenses actually incurred in connection with that class of business. In other words, given that superannuation premiums and the investment component of life insurance premiums increase the overall deductions available to life insurance companies, the second amendment will ensure that these premiums will also be included in the formula which determines, on a proportional basis, how allowable deductions relate to the various classes of income of the life insurance company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular concerns LIFA raised with us in relation to the second amendment are complex. Its main concern is that a group of expenses will be apportioned to differently taxed classes of income by the amended formula, even though these deductions are not necessarily boosted by the inclusion of premiums in the formula which determines allowable deductions, and that this will work to the disadvantage of the life offices. The formulas used to apportion the income and expenses of life insurance companies were included in the act in 1988 with the agreement of the life insurance industry, mainly to ease the compliance burden for life insurance companies. It is the case, however, that, as with any formula approach, this will not necessarily provide the most appropriate outcome for each individual expense when it is looked at in isolation. For some expenses a formula approach may result in a less valuable deduction for the life insurance companies and, equally, for other expenses the outcome may be more generous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the formula approach is to provide an outcome which overall provides an appropriate determination of deductions when applied to a variety of different expenses. One of the options to address LIFA's concerns would have been to resort to a greater number of formulas to determine and apportion separate classes of deductions but, as I have mentioned before, this would have added considerable complexity to the law but with no guarantees that a more appropriate outcome would be obtained. Our approach&mdash;I think it is the desirable approach&mdash;to resolve issues relating to the appropriateness or otherwise of the determination and apportionment of deductions is to move away from a formula approach to an approach whereby income deductions are determined and apportioned to the maximum extent possible in a manner which is consistent with the actual income and expenses  of each class of business, which we call a factual basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the government we have been exploring the possibility of moving to a factual approach, and we have informed LIFA that we are currently in the process of developing a paper outlining the issues raised in moving to a factual basis for discussion with that industry. I note that in LIFA's discussions with us it too was keen to move to a factual basis.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A move to a more factually based approach involves consideration of some complex issues, and we will take some time, therefore, to work this out. Certainly in the interim the formula approach will be maintained. The apportionment formula contained in the amendment provides a fairer and more consistent basis for the treatment of deductions overall than does the current law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention of that second amendment is to provide a formula which results in an appropriate apportionment of deductions between classes of income when applied to all the relevant deductions as a whole. It is our view that, if we had taken on LIFA's suggestion and let only the first amendment go through, the overall income would have erred significantly on the generous side for life insurance companies. So it was not possible to go down its route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will reiterate that we have been in close contact with LIFA on this issue. We have certainly held good discussions with it and have treated its concerns well. We are to remain in contact with LIFA over these complex matters. Nevertheless, we have chosen to introduce both of these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has indicated our approach to LIFA and has noted that in LIFA's correspondence with us it has a preference to move away from the formula approach to a factual basis for the tax of life companies. We have already informed LIFA of the work that we are doing on that, and we agree that that approach offers good prospects in moving to a means of taxing life insurance companies in a more acceptable manner to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We note in the attachment to some correspondence we have from LIFA that it canvasses the possibility of providing a separate formula for the apportionment of certain deductions, but it was our feeling, after considerable work on this, that there would be too great a complexity introduced without providing for a better overall outcome for either party&mdash;government or life insurance. We reiterate that the way forward on these issues would be best achieved by focusing on establishing an agreed approach to implementing a factual basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to speak on only those matters relating to that section of the bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Amendment Bill and to endorse the amendments of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I draw attention to the fact that once again we are debating taxation bills&mdash;and some of them are rather pernicious. I came into this parliament about 18 years ago, and in looking at the volume of legislation that has been passed since then&mdash;I give the example of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), which is some 60-odd pages long&mdash;I think the size of tax bills has probably increased 10 times in that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the only problem. The complexity of the taxation laws has increased so much that it is now impossible for John Citizen to do his own income tax return, for two reasons: first, the fear that he may have missed out on a deduction he might have claimed; and, secondly, the fear that he might have overstated a deduction and understated income unintentionally and be subject to a fine. As a result, it is now the norm for consultants, QCs, specialists and everybody else in the taxation field to involve themselves in the tax affairs of John Citizen and the companies around Australia, substantially increasing the costs to business and to individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns), who is at the table, would say, `So what?' because they get a taxation deduction for it in the long term. But I bring to the attention of the House the fact that, particularly in the taxation area, we need clear English and clear expression so that people can understand what is required. This will enable them to go about their business of tax lodgment and recording without the current fears of recriminations. In those 18 years a great cost has been imposed on businesses on a pro rata basis&mdash;businesses which are already suffering from increased taxation, let alone the cost of keeping accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather interesting that while we talk about complexity, the tax office was affected by the public servants strike yesterday which closed some offices and shortened the business hours of many others. This followed a work to rule procedure of a month ago when John Citizen could access taxation offices only within certain hours. It was suggested here within the last 12 months or so that, under an enterprise bargaining agreement, a proficiency bonus would be allocated to taxation staff who were able to collect more taxes. But that is the degree of their proficiency; people who are prepared to leave the affairs of the Commonwealth in disarray through stoppages such as these should not receive proficiency bonuses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This smells a little of a book I am reading entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China</EMPHASIS>. It goes back to the China of the 1950s and 1960s where everybody was peering over everyone else's shoulder to make sure that they were not expressing any revolutionary slogans and were being faithful to the state. Sometimes I feel that our government departments&mdash;particularly the Taxation Office in offering incentives for the collection of taxation that is unintentionally avoided&mdash;are almost going back to those times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of this strike by public servants, I have also received a complaint about the Taxation Office, under its guidelines, continuing to put great pressure on tax agents over the lodgment of returns. For the individual, the complexity of the system has increased tenfold over the last 18 years. I am suggesting that the tax agents face a similar situation and similar stress. To be now pressured further by limiting their extension of time for the lodgment of returns I think goes beyond the pale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bill, the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Amendment Bill, takes into account the reduction of the company tax rate to 33c. I know that the main bill also separates the profits not distributed in a company prior to the reduction to 33c at the 39c level and then again at the 33c level. I think this measure is equitable and I hope it is given a lot of prominence because some company accountants could well be able to distribute profits from those pre-33c in the dollar days, and they should be encouraged to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at a reduction from 39c to 33c. I believe the main explanations in the bill put the saving to the companies and in Commonwealth expenditure at $440 million in 1993-94, $1.83 billion in 1994-95 and $1.62 billion in 1995-96. I do not believe there is included in that calculation the contrary situation that will apply to shareholders above the marginal rate of 33c whereby, on imputation, they will be called upon to make up the difference between the 33c in their marginal rate and the current 39c marginal rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A company that distributes all of its profits&mdash;I cannot think of too many that do&mdash;will be caught in a situation where there has been simply a transfer of the taxation liability from the company to the shareholders. This will mean that a shareholder in receipt of a dividend will only need to have income of over $20,701, after which the tax rate is 35.33c in the dollar for 1993-94. The government might herald the reduction of 39c to 33c, but this was done not for any economic reason, but to counter the tax regime that the opposition proposed in the last election whereby personal rates of taxes were going to fall substantially. This, in addition to the budget itself, is not good news for the shareholder and personal taxpayer in any way whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We well remember the promised tax cuts that were l-a-w but which turned out to be no more than an l-i-e. A lot of Australians will be remembering that at the moment. I have said it before: if the misrepresentation that has been perpetrated by the Labor Party on the people of Australia was in fact rendered by a company secretary, such misrepresentation would be subject to the Trade Practices Act and the companies and securities legislation and be subject to severe fines. Yet in the case of this most blatant misrepresentation, which has the greatest cost for the Australian people, the Labor Party and the Labor government escape any penalty whatsoever. It is a matter of do what I say, not do what I do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken in this House on many occasions since the introduction of the fringe benefits tax. I am one of the few members who was here when that tax was introduced. I remember it very well. The tax shows the desperation of this Labor government to pick up income from any source whatsoever, but I think it is morally wrong for a tax on somebody's income or benefit to be imposed on the employer. I remember when it was first introduced. The fringe benefits tax was, in the first 24 hours of its notification, going to be a tax on the employee who received the benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can quite well remember the ACTU President at the time coming to the realisation that his car, his telephone and a lot of the other fringe benefits in his ACTU salary were going to be subject to the fringe benefits tax. The original contention lasted 24 hours, when the ACTU muscled in on the government to bring that liability back against the employer. I still believe it is a pernicious tax; it is morally wrong, and this bill does cover some further exemptions and some amendments in this regard. As I have said, fringe benefits tax really scrapes the bottom of tax morality; it scrapes the absolute depths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we look at the budget for this year, we see that there will be $1,430 million collected in fringe benefits taxation and $90,443 million collected in overall taxation. The budget is still bereft of $16 billion, and that has put us further into the red. I read the other day that, of all the nations in the world, Australia, with its small population of almost 17 million people, has the largest per capita debt. That is nothing to write home to anyone about and, again, in spite of the measures that are being taken, this is where Australia finds itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me in this bill, as it has in previous bills, is that the government is hitting the only economically performing sector of the community: business and individuals. In some cases, it is taxing them out of existence as they try to bear the costs of these taxes and increases. I mention just a few: the fringe benefits tax, the training levy, the superannuation guarantee charge, the increase in excise and fuel charges, the sales tax increase, health and safety regulations&mdash;and they are just a few. I remember that just 12 months ago I was looking at a report from a company. The secretary had put together nine foolscap pages, which were in fairly fine print, of regulations, interventions and intrusions of taxation by government departments that a normal company trading in Australia today, whether it is a private or public company, has to deal with. Most of them require a return to be lodged under penalty of having fines imposed if they are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that has happened in the years that I have been a member of the House of Representatives is the gradual intrusion by the government into the field of advanced payment of taxes&mdash;the prescribed payment system, the advanced payment of provisional tax, and the advanced payment of company tax itself. While I would be the first to say that in years past many people were able to take advantage of, and probably abuse, the system by paying tax so far in arrears, it is not an undesirable thing. But, at the moment, I suggest that Australians are taxed right up to the minute and are being taxed, in many cases, on what is going to happen next year. The company rate of tax is probably the greatest example of that. The payment of taxation 28 days in advance, as at the end of the year, is, I think, a major penalty on those companies that are out there trying to keep liquid despite increasing debts, increasing stocks, and trying to expand. Yet they are asked to pay, within 28 days, 85 per cent of next year's tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I must say that there is some relief in this bill for those companies with tax liabilities of $1,000 or more, but less than $300,000; they can pay their tax in two instalments. Those companies get the benefit. The due date for the initial payment will be deferred by nine weeks from the 28th day of the month following the balance date, to the 28th day of the third month following the balance date. But it is still a major penalty for a company that is trying to survive in these difficult circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remark about the criminality of the tax uplift factor for 1993-94, which has been set at eight per cent. Some might say, `Alleluia, it has dropped from 10 per cent'. But how can a taxation regime that is looking at an inflation rate of two or three per cent in this coming year, and the unofficial growth rate of 2.5 per cent, suggest that an eight per cent uplift factor should be applicable as far as the provisional tax is concerned? Again, it has been the case in previous years where that factor has always been higher than the inflation rate, and has always been higher than the combined inflation and growth rates. It is a miserable and desperate measure by a government to drain the last dollar out of the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that Australia is not a saving nation. It is obvious why we are not a saving nation. The reason is that, in many cases, before individuals get their hands on the income they have worked for and derived, the money is taken out of their hands. If the government wants a reason why there has been so much foreign investment in Australia in the past in normal facilities that should have remained in Australian hands, the answer is quite simple: Australians were not able to afford those investments because they did not have any savings of their own, and that is when foreign investment became very much the lifeblood of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last election I was speaking with a particular small businessman&mdash;I spoke with many&mdash;and this small businessman was just letting me know the effect that all these regulations and taxes were having on his business. He had started with six employees; within six months, he had dropped that number to two employees. He and his wife had had one meal together in six months. They had worked the whole seven days a week continually since that time; that was the only way they could make ends meet. Of course, we were talking about the fringe benefits tax at that stage. As far as that small business is concerned, it recognised that, on expenditure, tax should be paid by the final consumer, whereas, as far as income is concerned, it is all pre-dedicated to the Taxation Office. Goodness only knows what the small businesses in Australia do to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about family taxation because I believe that is very important. Many of our companies and businesses are family based. The families associated with those businesses are the very fabric of our society, morally and economically. It is interesting to note what has happened to that sector. When I started accounting, back in the 1950s, the personal tax rate at the highest marginal rate was 11 times greater than the average weekly earnings. Fair enough, the taxation rate at that amount was equivalent to about 68c to 70c in the dollar. One only struck the highest marginal rate of tax when one was earning 11 times the average weekly earnings. In 1993, the highest rate of tax paid is applied at just under two times average weekly earnings. I think that is absolutely scandalous and, again, bears out the fact that there is no-one saving money these days because the tax office  is getting the major proportion of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was recently able to have the benefit of hearing a lecture by Mr Barry Maley to a group in Parliament House. He is a senior fellow at the Centre of Independent Studies. I want to read part of his speech because I think it is very important that we recognise who is bearing the burden of taxation in this country. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1950, a single income, two-child family on average weekly earnings, after subtracting taxation and then adding in child and family allowances, received a net income six per cent higher than the original earnings. By 1990, that same family was receiving a net income 14 per cent lower than the original income. In 1950, singles paid twice as much tax as a married couple, two-child family with one income. By 1990 the effective tax rate was only 6 per cent more for singles.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generous treatment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>for those in the welfare industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is coming in large part from the pockets of families with dependent children; families which now need to send mothers out to work in order to maintain living standards.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a reflection on where our society has gone in the last 40-odd years. It is certainly not forwards, it is backwards. There are quite a few other things within this bill that I could comment on. One is the non-profit tourism industry bodies which are going to be given an exemption under section 23(h) as being non-profit bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest anomaly within the tax act at the moment is the manner in which unions&mdash;I mentioned the Public Sector Union and its one-day block-out&mdash;enjoy an exempt status under the taxation act. I think it is section 27 which says that the funds accumulated by employers and employees in unions are treated as non-profit, yet a tremendous amount of income is generated from those groups. I am not just talking about individual subscriptions, but interest from investments and the types of investments they go into. If this government was fair dinkum about trying to get the tax cheats, that would be one place to start. In doing so, perhaps it might look at the accountability to society that trade unions do not allow for their members. Yet we as a society&mdash;particularly companies&mdash;are asked by the government to do so many other things. There is a 10 times increase in volume as a result of a government that says it wants to stop tax evasion, but the only way to do that is with a goods and services tax. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The discussion this afternoon on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Amendment Bill has been wide ranging and at times has moved somewhat from the detail of the bills before the House. Nevertheless, if we are to have a general debate about tax issues, it is worth while, first, to look at the provisions of the bill before the House and, secondly, to conduct some sort of overview of taxation arrangements in Australia generally. That is what the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) invited others to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the comments that have come from opposition speakers, the bills are overwhelmingly positive for taxpayers. They recognise a number of criticisms that have been made recently, especially in relation to small business and in payment timing for company tax. There has been a call from the tourist industry in the past for exemption from taxation provisions for some non-governmental bodies and associations in the tourism industry. There are sales tax exemptions for the RSPCA and there are very important measures relating to dividend imputation and changes because of the previously legislated reductions in the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these measures, and the ones the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) referred to relating to the life insurance industry, are designed to give benefits to various sectors of the community in the provision of tax arrangements. Also&mdash;and very importantly&mdash;they ensure that the fairness and equity provisions applied to dividend imputation arrangements are maintained. Already in this debate we have heard about the level of taxation. It is worth noting that the cuts in the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent were primarily designed to ensure that our company tax regime was competitive with that of our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were substantial outlays to introduce that change. It meant we were able to cut the company tax rate without the savage impost of a GST such as the one the opposition used to advocate before it was beaten in the 1993 election. Fundamentally, the cut in company tax was designed so that, as the economy improved, economic activity increased and, as we had further investment occurring, companies could be competitive and business could invest competitively in Australia compared with our trading partners. We know that we need a tax regime that is competitive, particularly with countries in our region; otherwise we will not get the level of investment we need to get economic activity accelerating at the proper pace. That is precisely what that change was designed to bring about. It was an important change. Despite all the toing-and-froing over the budget, the change has not had the attention it deserved. There has been a significant cut in the company tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now competitive. We have a tax regime which, as a whole series of studies has shown, is certainly competitive with our trading partners. It has not been mentioned today, but the suggestion has been made that the income tax changes were part of the budget process and have not been delivered. But the fact is that on 15 November we will get the cuts in personal income tax. The first stage of the income tax cuts comes in seven months early&mdash;not delayed, deferred or axed, as was suggested. The cuts will be introduced seven months earlier than intended and will have the direct effect of assisting people on average weekly earnings. They relate to incomes between $20,700 and $50,000&mdash;precisely the people in the middle-income bracket who have not been the beneficiaries of previous cuts in personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that this government cut the personal income tax rate from the 60 per cent level under the previous Liberal government down to 47.5 per cent. It also brought in the lower tax scale rates. The rates of low income earners were also reduced as part of the government's tax reform arrangements. So income tax for the lower income end and the higher end of the spectrum have been reduced. The cuts that are part of this year's budget proposals have been delivered for the middle-income sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills will add substantially to the real impact the government has had in trying to encourage a competitive financial arrangement in Australia. One of the inequities that used to apply under tax arrangements was the double taxation arrangement. The landmark in dividend imputation removed that anomaly. When people talk today about levels of savings and so on, it is worth pointing to the fact that there is substantial interest in our share market today partly because of the very positive arrangements relating to share treatment and the dividend imputation arrangements which have really encouraged people to be investors in a productive share business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in this legislation add a degree of certainty to some of the arrangements as a result of the cut in the company tax rate. The provisions outlined here set up a dual franking system in relation to dividend imputation. They adjust the required franking account provisions to take account of the two franking accounts and to ensure the available class A franking credits are used to frank dividends first. Further, they adjust the franking process and the franking rebate calculation to take account of the two franking accounts. They ensure the franking deficit tax can be properly calculated for the two franking accounts and the initial payment of tax can be offset against any aggregate franking deficit tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, they adjust the machinery provisions of the imputation system, including self-assessment, to take account of the two franking accounts and install a transitional provision to apply to dividends paid early by balancing of companies. Those arrangements clearly spell out the value of, first, the changes in the company tax arrangements and, secondly, the real benefit that will flow from dividend imputation being applied with this dual and flexible arrangement as outlined here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They give the best possible outcome, given the transitional arrangements required with the cuts in company tax. All these measures are important in ensuring that the full value of dividend imputation is retained and that the benefits to the community are retained. Rather than have the sort of negative comment that we have had about the bills and about the tax arrangements generally, one would have thought the dividend imputation arrangements and the logical progression in these bills would have been welcomed by the opposition. People are demonstrating, by their attitude to investment, just how valuable those arrangements are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to see that these arrangements that were part and parcel of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the Nation</EMPHASIS> in February are being implemented. We are giving positive effect to the change and maintaining the value of that change to companies and to investors to try to ensure the best possible outcome for the competitive tax environment and the dividend imputation rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly refer to the discussion that has been going on about sales tax exemptions for child-care services. I particularly welcome the initiative by the government to ensure exemption from sales tax, particularly for occasional child care. Many of us have had representations about that issue. I am very pleased to see the government has taken up the cause of those in the industry for sales tax exemption across the range of child-care services. It is certainly a valuable benefit. We all recognise the importance of child-care services&mdash;public or private&mdash;and the value they provide to many people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures in these bills, and the budget measures that have already been enacted, give strong effect to the government's pledges that were given on child care before the election. I certainly welcome the initiatives to extend the measures to occasional child care and to the range of family day care that are outlined, because I think they will be tremendously helpful to many of the centres that often struggle with limited budget arrangements and limited financial resources to make ends meet. I am grateful that the government has been able to take positive steps to deal effectively with the particular requirements and requests that have been raised by centres in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the company tax changes that are contained in this bill. The bill gives effect to the announcement in the 1993-94 budget for relief for small business by deferring initial payments of company tax in respect of the 1993-94 income year. The companies affected are those with a tax liability of $1,000 or more but less than $300,000 and which pay their tax in two instalments. The due date for the initial payment will be deferred by nine weeks from the 28th day of the month following the balance date to the 28th day of the third month following the balance date. As for previous deferrals in the 1990-91 and 1991-92 income years, the amendments will ensure that franking deficit tax and franking credit tax and debits will be determined as if there had been no deferral in the initial tax payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure, which has an impact of about $10 million on the 1993-94 budget, is nevertheless one that will be of significant assistance to many smaller companies in the community. We recognise the importance of those smaller companies to Australia's economic recovery and the importance of their cash flow arrangements. The changes announced in the bill go a significant way towards meeting the requests and the representations that have come to us from the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the provisions in the bill concerning the tourism industry, I think they are an important recognition that tourism&mdash;and its diversity&mdash;is one of the most important developing industries in Australia. In these measures we have said that we recognise that there will be a variety of groups that will develop skills, particularly in regional tourism promotion. As those bodies are developing markets for their particular parts of Australia, they should be given an opportunity to expand their promotional efforts. The exemption that is contained in this bill for income tax purposes will give them an additional incentive to develop those types of coordinating mechanisms and to use them effectively. Increasingly, from a variety of regions around Australia, we notice that there is a determination to see tourism more in a composite form&mdash;not, for instance, one local government authority doing its thing and another local government authority down the road trying to do its thing&mdash;and there is a need for them to marry their goals and their range of policies to try to promote and harness interest in their regions. This particular change is one element in which the government is showing its commitment to that industry and its diverse nature, and the need to have tax policies that do not run out of kilter with that broader growth industry that has developed so magnificently in Australia over the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we continue to keep an active interest in tax arrangements relating to an industry such as tourism. The government has used a variety of measures in recent times that have been beneficial to the industry&mdash;depreciation and investment allowance arrangements, and other things. It is a dynamic industry and there needs to be a continuing process of monitoring to ensure that the tax arrangements for the tourism industry are very competitive. We know that the tourism market around the world is extremely competitive. If we want to get the optimum value out of our tourism industry, at all times we need to see that its tax treatment matches the competitive environment. I am pleased to see that this bill is lending weight to that occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already touched upon the very important changes relating to child care exemptions for sales tax purposes. The sales tax exemption for the RSPCA&mdash;which has already been touched on by previous speakers&mdash;is an important recognition of the organisation and its work throughout Australia. Like most honourable members, I have had representations on this issue over a significant period of time. It is pleasing to see that all of our collective representations have brought forth the fruit that everyone was desiring, and have ensured that the exemption is granted. The RSPCA is an organisation which has the highest regard of the community, and I would hope of the parliament. As such, I welcome the sales tax exemption that is contained in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference has been made already to the fact that other groups come along to us with strong cases in relation to sales tax exemption, and many of those groups are in schedules that currently have sales tax exemption. No doubt members of parliament on both sides will have cause to make representations in the future about other groups that have deserving cases. All that we can hope for is that we can produce the same sort of cogent case that has been produced here in respect of the RSPCA, and that it will meet the same positive recognition from the government and the then Treasurer. I feel confident that similar organisations will get appropriate treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the issues relating to the life assurance industry. There has been quite an active campaign by the industry in relation to what it regards as some inequitable treatment of specific deductions for tax purposes, and the apportionment of deduction arrangements as far as some companies are concerned. These bills, as the parliamentary secretary has pointed out, go a long way towards meeting those concerns and establishing a fair regime for the treatment of superannuation funds. It is important that we continue to monitor the changes in that area, maintain a dialogue with the industry, and continue to ensure that the treatment of these different developing areas of tax reform is equitable. The amendments before the parliament help ensure that occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax has been raised in the debate. It is important to note that the fringe benefits tax tried to ensure a return to equity as far as the treatment of taxpayers was concerned. Fundamentally, the fringe benefits tax recognises that people who are PAYE taxpayers, and have most of their tax liability calculated through that system, should not be treated any differently or in a more adverse way from someone who gets non-cash benefits, non-direct income benefits, in the form of fringe benefits. To suggest that we go back to the old days&mdash;I did not think it was opposition policy to go back to the old days of saying that the fringe benefits tax should not exist anymore, if that were the inference contained in the earlier remarks&mdash;would be a retrograde step. We need to ensure fair treatment of all taxpayers. Whether they derive their income as PAYE taxpayers or have other forms of income, as far as possible they should receive equal treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have removed things such as the double tax arrangements which used to apply in the pre-dividend imputation days, and that is a positive benefit. We have cut the company tax rate and we have cut income tax rates as well. Part of the strategy for dealing with that has been to ensure that people pay the level of tax that is commensurate with their income. That is what the fringe benefits tax has been about. Fundamentally, it is what the discussion over the years about capital tax has been about&mdash;ensuring that there has been fair and equitable treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the bills before the House in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) are an important part of maintaining that equity. I would argue that our very positive changes as far as dividend imputation is concerned have been some of the most substantial tax reforms that this country has seen in decades. The fact that we are ensuring the consistency and coherence of those measures with the cuts in the company tax rates in this bill reflects our continuing commitment to dividend imputation and the value it brings to the Australian community and to Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought it could be well supported by the opposition rather than the negative comments we have had from it about tax arrangements in Australia. The pity of it was that it was not the opposition's initiative to bring in the dividend imputation arrangement. It came from this side and was a very positive thing. It should be welcomed by all of us. I have pleasure in supporting the bills before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the problem. The Minister for Social Security reminds me that they should be seen and not heard. It is when they are not heard that we also have difficulty. People should be constantly reminded of their taxes. For instance, we should be buying fuel, as we would in America, at so much plus tax. Where that is impractical in America, at places such as Disneyworld and other places, the authorities oblige the people by putting a very clear statement of the break-up of the $US35 or whatever the entry fee is. We see what is the actual fee and we see what state, provincial and federal government gets from that amount of money. There is a legal obligation on resellers to tell the consumer who is getting the money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also very obvious when we go into small consumer stores. When we wish to purchase an article which is clearly marked on the shelf at $10 we find when we go to pay for it that the person at the cash register says it is $US11. We say, `Hang on a minute. It is marked at $10'. They say, `Yes, but the dollar is tax'. I have had people complain to me about that procedure. They get annoyed by it. I said, `Well, I hope you continue to be annoyed by it. I believe that it is by your annoyance that governments will be less avaricious in how much of your income they might receive'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an interesting point that at a conference I attended recently a leading Australian businessman gave an example of the circumstances and the effect of taxation and all the other things that are applied, particularly today. We have a reference in this debate to fringe benefits tax. We have this new regime of benefits provided to a third party&mdash;the employee&mdash;being taxed in the hands of the employer. We have fringe benefits tax, the superannuation guarantee charge and of course other penalties such as payroll tax, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This fellow got up and cited the case of an employee within his organisation who earned $40,000 a year. He then identified these numerous add-ons and pointed out that after the add-ons that employee's total cost to his organisation was $57,000 a year. Then came the tragedy of his advice when he told the meeting that that person would take home $28,000 a year. Here was a person on a salary of $40,000 a year&mdash;at a cost to the business, and therefore to the people who consumed these various assets or the items that he produces, of $57,000&mdash;but whose take-home pay was $28,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about here in all these so-called amendments and changes is what is left for the worker. If we were to follow that worker around after he went home with his measly $28,000&mdash;when he was employed on $40,000 and at a cost to the employer of $57,000; $28,000 is less than half of that $57,000, and that is borne out by all the other statistics that show that the government takes 40-odd per cent of the national economy&mdash;we would find him taxed on just about everything that moved. He would pay tax on his new car, he would pay tax on his fuel and, what is more, he would pay tax on registering his mortgage. It is a real worry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be a need for more visibility. The way petrol pricing fluctuates today by 10c or 15c a week makes that notification more important simply because the people have no idea who is getting the dollar or the cent this week. I think they are entitled to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at some of the other aspects of the provisions that we have within this legislation, I note certainly with approval that the RSPCA is to have more certainty put into its circumstances and it is to be exempt from sales tax. One could think of no organisation that is more entitled to be exempt, and I would have thought that it had had it for a lot longer than this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That draws my attention to the fact that, whilst this is going on and whilst this matter tightens up or changes in some way the fringe benefits tax regime, we find that another group, well established throughout Australia but particularly in New South Wales, called the business enterprise centres, has been told that it is going to lose its exempt status. BECs must be one of the more effective ways of assisting small business that I can think of. For a start, the business enterprise centres cost the federal government nothing. They get funding&mdash;50 per cent of their operating costs&mdash;from state governments on a dollar for dollar basis. The other 50 per cent is contributed by the community; that is the cash component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such service clubs as Rotary have taken a serious interest in this area and provided funding. But the greatest resource that the centres provide to small business is provided absolutely free. I am talking here about active and retired businessmen who voluntarily provide their services to these BECs for the purpose of advising prospective and established business people in the small business area to assist them to survive in what is a very difficult situation. One particular executive officer, informs me that he passes about half his clients&mdash;people coming to him to seek that initial advice&mdash;on to people who are experienced in the business and who work for nothing, about half of whom are unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a huge new development in terms of the small business sector. These are people who have found themselves redundant from government enterprise, government services or large business enterprises, who have been paid quite substantial redundancy fees in many cases, and who seriously do not want to be unemployed and so take the small business option. They go and risk everything they have accumulated during their life of employment&mdash;their redundancy money and any superannuation payment, and they probably remortgage the house, which they had probably paid off&mdash;to get into a business. Hundreds, if not thousands of them are making very bad decisions because the advice is not available or it is available from people who, in my view, lack the experience that these business enterprise councils provide. They are not necessarily advised by successful businessmen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether the Public Service likes it or not, it is a simple fact that if people go broke in business one of the places they go to get a job is to the small business section of some government department, where they are more than likely to be given a job. I guess someone who has gone broke at least can explain to people how it happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the BECs are, in many cases, providing active businessmen or those who have retired in comfort and are willing to give of their time, and that is wonderful because it is good for them. These people are out there helping out. We have the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) running around presenting small business awards and getting his photograph in the paper. Yesterday, we had the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) telling the MTIA that he is determined to find more capital for small business. I worked out that, if he found $25,000 for every small business&mdash;which, I can tell him, does not go very far in a small business&mdash;that would be $19 billion. But, while he is doing that, will he find capital for people who do not know how to run a business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all these spectacular schemes but, more importantly, the amount of tax revenue the government will recover by removing the small tax advantage from BECs, which primarily allows a centre to buy a car for its executive officer free of sales tax, would not equal what the Minister for Science and Small Business is probably spending by flying around Australia at the moment handing out these small enterprise awards. I do not want to be seen as being critical of small enterprise awards, because I am not; we should use the opportunity to encourage those who succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another group wants to get into small business and there are those who are experiencing difficulty in small business. We have this very cost-effective scheme and the government is turning around and saying that they are not entitled to those sorts of tax benefits. The only people who receive remuneration are the executive officers and they clearly have to feed their families. Everybody else donates his or her time, and a large group of Australians are donating their money. Having decided that the RSPCA, a worthy organisation, is to be exempt, the government is going to impose the tax on previously exempt BECs. That is totally silly. It is not cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the government is running around telling us what it is doing in the NEIS sector; in other words, giving financial support to the unemployed while they establish themselves in small business. What do those people need next? Good advice, and one could not get better advice than these groups give. I hope the government stops and thinks how foolish it is, particularly with regard to the cost to revenue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The business enterprise centres, the BECs, of which New South Wales has about 47. In fact, about 2,500 to 3,000 volunteers give this advice. These councils are well established. It is of considerable concern to them that they are losing this benefit, which I do not believe they would have been abusing in any way. However, they do need some help, and it is value for money. It is not a novel situation to Australia. Years ago, the Americans established a similar arrangement&mdash;I have forgotten the name they gave it&mdash;and it is very positive. And, of course, it is needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note, with approval, that the government has again extended the time for small companies with a tax liability of between $1,000 and $300,000 to pay company tax. On behalf of small business, I thank the government for that consideration. There are some aspects of dividend imputation that are also mentioned in this particular area. Whilst what the government has done is to be recommended, to break it up so that the 39c rate can be passed on until the 33c rate applies is a matter of complexity, but I doubt whether there is a solution to it, so we just have to accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am interested&mdash;I will come back to this matter if I have time&mdash;in some of the references to life assurance companies. I note that we are still applying certain special rules to those companies through capital gains which are not available to the small business sector. Again, I would like the minister to give serious consideration to one of the best things that could be done for small business; that is, simply to pick up the opposition's policy on the rollover of capital gains. A top limit can be put on it&mdash;a lot of things can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today an energetic business family can, literally, buy a business, improve its value by 50 per cent, decide to sell it for the purpose of investing in a larger business and then go through that process again. By the time that family has paid capital gains tax, commission on the sale and stamp duty on the new business, it has less money than it started with. I just cannot believe that is the intention of a capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is, even if the rollover is taken into account in the appropriate way, that family is got at in the end&mdash;presuming it sells for the last time to go into retirement. Why not give such a family a chance, while it is progressing through business development, of reinvesting its assets? If that family does not reinvest its assets and takes a holiday, then it is charged capital gains tax. But, if it reinvests in another business of a reasonably similar type, why should it be discouraged from doing that? Why should that family be locked into the original business because it actually shows a loss by selling out? All these things are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is more to selling out than just capital gains tax. There is the commission which is generally paid to an estate agent on selling the business. The state government is waiting with its hand out because it is tradition, again, that the purchaser always pays the stamp duty on a new purchase. I have done the sums and it is evident that such a family can be worse off than when it started, having put a lot of time, effort and long hours into building up a business and creating an asset. It just cannot get on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area I want to refer to on behalf of small business is the decision to retain the current provisional tax uplift at eight per cent. The original idea of having an uplift factor on provisional tax was for the government or the Australian Taxation Office to deem that, if someone made $100 this year, he or she was likely, through the processes of inflation, to make $110 or $105 in the following year. We know that inflation is not eight per cent. We know that business generally has huge pressures on its profits and is not growing at anywhere near eight per cent. I do not know why, in the present environment, the uplift factor is retained at all but, more importantly, why it is retained at such a high level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that eight per cent does not sound much but it is well beyond what most businesses would anticipate by way of increased profits unless there has been some investment in the business that is, undoubtedly, at a cost anyway. The simple fact is that the government should look to that. It was applied for a purpose. I do not think it was intended as a straight money grab. I do not think the government should go on deeming at these rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For years the government was stuck on the principle that an investment returned 10 per cent&mdash;we had this mythical 10 per cent and the government deemed 10 per cent for pensioners and it deemed 10 per cent for other people. Yet any businessman will tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that a return of 10 per cent on assets is dreamtime, in good times, not bad. It just does not happen; it is a myth generated amongst people who have never had the experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the government is saying that one could expect people with a tax liability to have a tax liability for the forthcoming year that is eight per cent higher, that is very unlikely. What does a person have to do to escape it? He has to go in and object to that assessment and then make a statement that there is no way in the world that the tax liability will increase by that amount. Such a person is then confronted with some aberration in business turning up; we do not know what that might be. If such a person does achieve those results, notwithstanding that he was totally honest in predicting it could not be done, he is suddenly a tax cheat and could be subject to substantial penalties and interest rates which are much higher than people can borrow money for today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again make the point that interest rates were lifted to 20 per cent. The old law had them at about five per cent when interest rates got up to 16 per cent. It was clearly quite silly. It did not pay people to pay their tax, and I do not support that. We have not seen interest rates withdrawn at sensible rates to reflect the contemporary situation. I believe it is time that they were. Of course, this particular piece of legislation does nothing for that&mdash;it entrenches the eight per cent uplift&mdash;and both the provisional tax and the uplift factor are very debilitating for small businesses which are having such difficulty. They go to borrow money. The reason they are not able to get it is not that the banks do not like them but that their bottom line does not in fact support a claim. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill deals with a wide range of tax issues, most of them unrelated. They demonstrate the vast extension of tax measures under Labor in government. In the 10 years of ALP government a huge range of new taxes has been invented. In fact, most of the taxes to be amended in these bills tonight did not even exist before Labor came to office. If Labor were half as creative in doing positive things to get our country moving again as it is in inventing new taxes, I am sure we would be a whole lot better off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These taxes have placed an enormous burden on Australian industry: much of the administration associated with these measures is in fact borne by business. It is business that has to fill out all the new forms and employ extra people to administer the new tax regimes that have been introduced by Labor. Is it any wonder that, under Labor, bankruptcies have trebled? I noticed some new figures released by the minister this last month. For the September quarter, Queensland bankruptcies are up by 17.9 per cent. I guess we will start to break those records now in Queensland as we are the only state left&mdash;after Labor is defeated in South Australia&mdash;with a government that believes the best thing it can do for business is to invent new taxes. The Goss government has certainly not been left behind by other Labor governments around Australia in the way in which it has increasingly raised tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, Labor seems to try to make a virtue out of the new taxes that it has invented. It frequently talks about broadening the tax base as though that is something good&mdash;providing new taxes for business to administer and providing new complexities and new difficulties for the Australian economy. When government members talk about tax cuts&mdash;they do that from time to time&mdash;it seems that, inevitably, following the tax cuts, they still raise more money. Despite all the tax cuts that Labor has given us over its decade in office, total tax revenue has increased by over 150 per cent&mdash;individual taxes are up 250 per cent; company tax is up over 300 per cent; sales tax is up over 300 per cent; and petrol excise is up 600 per cent. Of course, every other tax that it has invented has added to its tax revenue. So, instead of tax cuts, we have massive tax increases. Indeed, Labor has been the great taxer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. They tax everyone, and everyone's patience as well. Many of the new taxes invented by Labor are amended by this bill: the fringe benefits tax, a tax paid by employers on the iniquitous principle that one person is expected to pay another person's tax; the capital gains tax, the tax that Labor promised us we would never have. Of course, everyone knows how empty Labor's taxation promises are these days, and hopefully people will never be allowed to forget the deceit and dishonesty in the 1993-94 budget when we got all the taxes Labor said we would never have. Sales tax has been simplified by this government but in a way that again has increased horrendously the burden on industry and resulted in major increases in revenue for the government; the revenue from the super funds tax has increased from $25 million to over $1.2 billion under this government; and the superannuation guarantee charge is a conceptual failure which is destroying people's confidence in superannuation and has done more damage than good in encouraging people to be self-reliant and to put aside for their retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just those taxes alone. Other taxes invented by Labor include the training guarantee levy, the prescribed payments system, the Medicare levy, the tertiary tax and now the wine tax. Is there to be no end? No, I do not think there is to be an end. We now have a Labor committee talking about a new jobs levy. Others in Labor are keen on death duties, wealth taxes and the like. So more and more taxes seem to be Labor's only solution to our nation's economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer specifically to a couple of items that are mentioned in this bill. As one or two previous speakers have said, some elements in a number of these measures are to be commended. I want to make some comments about the proposal in this legislation to provide sales tax exemption for the RSPCA. As other people have said, it is indeed commendable that the RSPCA is at last to be granted sales tax exemption. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, as the honourable member for Dawson interjects, it would be better if there were no such thing as sales tax so that these measures would not be necessary. But Labor is determined to increase the burden of sales tax as a major revenue source. It is commendable that the RSPCA is to be exempted from this particular tax and, what is more, that it is to be backdated to 13 March 1993. This measure arises, I understand, from a High Court decision of the 1930s. The High Court, in its wisdom, decided that the RSPCA was a charity and should be free from paying income tax but, as it was not a benevolent society because it did not help human beings, it was necessary for it to pay sales tax. The RSPCA has been pressing the various governments that have come and gone for relief from sales tax since that time. At last, that measure is to be brought to fruition. So I welcome the measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had something to do with the RSPCA in my electorate. I was closely associated with the development of a RSPCA facility in Kingaroy in my electorate. Indeed, I am proud to say it is built in Warren Truss Drive&mdash;a very wise selection of a venue. The RSPCA in Kingaroy certainly provides an outstanding service to the community. So this particular measure is welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is also an enormous degree of unfairness about this provision. The tax exemption is available to the RSPCA but not to the scores of other organisations which perform the same kinds of services. In many parts of Australia, animal care&mdash;looking after animals which are lost or need to be cared for or destroyed&mdash;is not undertaken by the RSPCA but by similar organisations with similar aims, objectives and structures. They will be excluded from this new benefit being provided. That should not come as a shock to the government. In fact, soon after the announcement was made, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) received a letter, which drew attention to these inequities, from the Lost Dogs Home in his electorate. I quote briefly from that letter. Mr Graeme Smith, the General Manager of the Lost Dogs Home, stated that the exemption to the RSPCA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is certainly a long overdue recognition of the community service aspect of animal welfare work. As such, it is very commendable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately the proposed measure is also inequitable and unfair. As the largest companion animal shelter in Victoria, The Lost Dogs' Home is doing exactly the same sort of rescue and shelter work as the RSPCA. Yet we must continue to pay Sales Tax. Moreover, this compounds an already unjust situation wherein public donations to the Home are not tax deductible, whilst donations to the RSPCA are.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me give you a dramatic illustration of this unfairness. Since 1991 The RSPCA Victoria and The Lost Dogs' Home have co-operated in animal rescue work. The RSPCA covers areas south of the Yarra, The Lost Dogs' Home covers areas north. However the RSPCA will pay approximately $4000 less for its ambulance in future because of the sales tax exemption.</PARA>
<PARA>A similar position exists in my own electorate. I have already referred to the Kingaroy RSPCA animal refuge. It will get the benefit of this sales tax exemption, and that is welcome. But the Maryborough animal refuge at the other end of my electorate, which is  operated by a community committee, will not get that benefit. If a dog is collected in Kingaroy it will be collected in a tax free vehicle; if it is collected in Maryborough sales tax will have been paid on the vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The food for cats in the RSPCA in Kingaroy will be exempt from the 21 per cent sales tax, which was increased in the last budget. The cats fed in Maryborough will be fed on fully taxed food. The soap used for washing animals in the Kingaroy RSPCA will be sales tax free, but the Maryborough animal refuge will have to pay the full 21 per cent tax on those requisites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterinary supplies bought in Kingaroy will be sales tax free, but in Maryborough those goods will be taxed. I have not examined it in a great deal of detail, but presumably when euthanasia is performed in Kingaroy it will be with a tax free drug, but in Maryborough taxes will have to be paid on these veterinary supplies. So here is Labor's death tax again; this time a death tax on animals&mdash;so long as they are not euthanised by the RSPCA. In Melbourne the situation is even more starkly obvious. Animals collected on one side of the river will be fed on food subject to sales tax; those collected on the other side of the river will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) and some others who referred to the obvious inequities in this case. The honourable member for Parramatta expressed the hope that other organisations would also be considered for this exemption in the future. He is a member of the government; this is his opportunity. The government, instead of just exempting the RSPCA, should exempt all of those organisations that are providing this very worthwhile service in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that when this bill gets to the Senate, when it is subjected to detailed scrutiny, that there will be some amendments or some requests to this House to ensure that there is justice and equity, that all animals are treated the same and that all organisations providing this kind of service are given the same kind of tax exemption. Perhaps government members opposite will do more than hope that the government will take this matter on board; I hope that they will act to ensure that appropriate amendments are made so that this very worthwhile concession is extended to all organisations providing care and relief for animals in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst dealing with the question of sales tax, I would like to refer to another sales tax anomaly that the government has promised to address on a number of occasions, but which again it has failed to take up in this bill. I refer to the sales tax anomaly that exists in relation to second-hand farm machinery. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr TRUSS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An absurd anomaly, and indeed the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has acknowledged that it is an anomaly. Currently farm machinery dealers have to pay sales tax on spare parts used to recondition second-hand equipment for future sales to primary producers, despite the fact they are exempt from sales tax. This sales tax, which amounts to about $10 million per year, is not refunded and as a result is recovered from farmers when they buy second-hand machinery from dealers. This has been raised with the Assistant Treasurer on a number of occasions, and he has written to a number of members of parliament acknowledging that the anomaly exists and&mdash;what is more important&mdash;promising to review this matter when sales tax matters are next under consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax matters are under consideration tonight, but this amendment has not been made. There were sales tax amendments considered earlier in this budget session, and again the government failed to act. I call on the Assistant Treasurer to be true to his word, to review this acknowledged anomaly and to make the necessary amendments to ensure that second-hand machinery is indeed exempt from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect the reality is that the government wants the money. Because it is the farm sector&mdash;the sector mercilessly persecuted by this government over such a long period of time&mdash;the government thinks it does not matter if another $10 million is being unjustly collected from the rural sector. Surely one day there has to be some honesty, some honour from this government. If ever there is a time when the rural sector needs this kind of consideration, it is surely now. Farmers are simply unable to afford to buy new machinery; they are forced to buy second-hand, reconditioned equipment. This government has so increased the tax burden on the rural sector, so reduced farmers' incomes, so destroyed farmers' capacity to survive the recession and the international economic situation, that farmers cannot afford to pay these additional tax burdens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993-94 budget further increased the tax burden on the rural sector. There have been several sales tax increases which farmers have had to pay, including the sales tax increase on second-hand farm machinery. The Assistant Treasurer should be honest and true to his word and review this iniquitous measure. I welcome the arrival of the Assistant Treasurer into the House. I hope in time he will announce that he will honour his written promise to so many people and review this iniquitous tax. Not only has he failed in that promise, but in the last budget he actually increased the amount of sales tax to be paid and is promising future increases in sales tax as the years go by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the iniquitous fuel tax increases which farmers will have to bear as a result of this budget. We are told that all of this is to fund income tax cuts which very few, if any, farmers will actually receive because they have to be earning a positive income, and a reasonably high income, before they will qualify for those tax cuts. So there will be a massive increase in farm costs as a result of the tax measures being introduced by this government, and farmers will not benefit from the compensation measures that are proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is this famous $150 tax rebate, but that is useless unless someone is actually paying tax. We do not get a tax rebate if we are not paying income tax. As the government ought to know, and as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) ought to have told the Assistant Treasurer and others with economic portfolios in the government when they were drafting the budget, according to ABARE figures&mdash;the government's own figures&mdash;most farmers will be earning negative incomes this year for the second year in a row and, for many people, for several years in a row. Because they have negative incomes they will not qualify for this miserable $150 tax rebate. I might add that a $150 tax rebate would not in any way cover the increases in fuel tax and sales taxes which have been imposed in the same budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They certainly could not afford to drink wine. Indeed, those poor winegrowers in our community are to be slugged with additional taxes. I understand that some of the measures associated with that tax are also to be introduced as late amendments to this bill. This is typical of the way in which the government has mercilessly exercised the guillotine during the budget debates. Bills are brought in and it is found, even before they reach the debating stage, that the government has to make a score of amendments. Is it any wonder that the poor taxpayers have been confused?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Census statistics have revealed something that really ought to drive home a very stern message to all Australians. The poorest federal electorates in Australia are all in regional and provincial areas. The electorates with the largest number of people earning below $16,000 and the least number of people earning above $60,000, are all located in rural and provincial areas. For a Labor government that talks about equity and social justice, what measures is it putting in place to help the most disadvantaged sector in the community&mdash;those living in rural and regional areas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what measures the government is proposing. There are increased fuel taxes, which are borne more harshly by those people in rural areas than in other parts of Australia. The government is proposing increased sales taxes and they will be borne by many people in business and industry to further restrict their capacity to survive Labor's recession. The government is imposing a wide range of new, harsh tests to ensure that many people in rural areas will not qualify for family payments and the like that have been available in the past. So these tax measures proposed tonight make some very small concessions. What benefits are there are welcome, but they make no real contribution to cutting back Labor's enormous taxation regime and doing something worthwhile to help Australians genuinely in need. </PARA>

Apart from delivering the budget, the Treasurer has not made a speech in this parliament since May last year. Of course, he was protected by standing orders from facing a censure motion or two over the past several weeks. The Assistant Treasurer really does not cover himself in glory.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Chairman, that was a timely intervention because that is what I was about to do. The opposition's views on the way in which the retrospectivity of the proposed legislation affects the mining, offshore mining and oil operators have already been touched on. The truth is that the government is attempting to correct its mistake of some three years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what the Assistant Treasurer said a moment ago, the problem had been canvassed with the Australian Taxation Office in the usual way through the normal consultative processes. It was raised with it in late 1991 and in early 1992. The little homily from the Assistant Treasurer about what Americans say about something looking too good to be true, really misses a fundamental point, or possibly more than one fundamental point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that period, the Australian Taxation Office issued private rulings which gave the affected taxpayers reason to believe that they could proceed in accordance with the law at the time.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the two occasions that the matter was raised in consultation with the Australian Taxation Office, it responded by advising that the matter was under consideration. This goes back to late 1991 and early 1992. There was a void of decision making. The Australian Taxation Office was approached and it ignored the problem for the best part of 18 months or more. Now the Assistant Treasurer has come in here with some stupid American saying about things looking too good to be true; that the truth is that the affected taxpayers would be confronted with what they are now faced with in this legislation. That is absolute tripe. There was a void of decision making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process, the Australian Taxation Office has gone a long way towards destroying the consultative procedures which it set up and, on so many occasions, relies on&mdash;in the form of rhetoric&mdash;to justify its actions by saying that it has consulted with industry, with tax practitioners or with others. It might consult with them, but it does not take any damn notice of them. This is the classic point. These people are in an industry which involves enormous outlays of capital. They are entitled to know where they stand in relation to their taxation obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are long lead times to offshore mineral miners, oil producers and explorers from Australia. They do not just say, `We are going to drill in the Timor Sea. Let's nick up there tomorrow'. There is a bit more to it than that, and even the Assistant Treasurer would know that. They have to get a drilling ship&mdash;a small item&mdash;or a drilling platform. They have to get a work force in position. It does not happen overnight. These people need to know where they stand in relation to taxation. Huge amounts of money are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not enough that this government has driven our oil explorers and our miners offshore through a whole litany of stupid acts. The government exacerbates its dilatoriness by then coming along and finding a mistake, which it has had ample opportunity to remedy in the past three years&mdash;certainly since late 1991&mdash;but yet has done nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would have been better had the Assistant Treasurer been here. He would have understood what we were talking about. He would also have known that the letter which was written to him quite recently pointed out many of the problems, along with the suspicion that the Assistant Treasurer did not know about what happened in late 1991 and early 1992 when he made his decision to take this retrospective tax measure. That is one of the downsides of a minister not being here when a measure is being debated, and it is why it is relevant to my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Assistant Treasurer to do a little cramming. I see he has been over to the advisers box and I am sure he has some trite response.

<PARA>Page 1 of the second reading speech on the amending act, Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 6) 1990, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments contained in this Bill will . . . implement the Budget announcement to extend the deductions for certain capital expenditures of particular activities in Australia to similar offshore activities that generate assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA>Page 5 of the second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the Bill will extend, in relation to foreign activities that generate assessable income . . . the deductions relating to mining and petroleum activities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The explanatory memorandum to Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 6) 1990 says:</PARA>

<PARA>The government proposes to amend the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) to provide deductions for the capital cost of establishing grapevines. Under existing income tax law, winegrowers are able to depreciate certain costs of establishing a vineyard. For instance, plant depreciation deductions are available for the cost of trellising and irrigation. However, the cost of acquiring and planting the grapevines themselves is not deductible or depreciable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has decided to allow expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1993 on establishing grapevines in Australia to be evenly written off over four years. The deductions will be available from the time the vines are planted. Costs currently eligible for depreciation deductions will continue to be deductible under those provisions. The cost of the amendments is estimated to be $1.5 million in 1994-95, $3 million in 1995-96 and $4.5 million in 1996-97. This measure will provide a significant benefit to grape growers and will facilitate the planting of new vines able to produce higher quality wine. It provides a considerably more generous deduction regime than that applying in other countries, such as New Zealand and the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment of the bill will make a minor technical change to the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 to clarify the extent to which penalties can apply to acts or omissions that happen after the introduction of amendments of the sales tax law but before they receive royal assent. The need for the amendment arises from suggestions that taxpayers are under no obligation to pay any sales tax until 28 days after the government's budget sales tax bills receive royal assent. The government is concerned that taxpayers might be confused by these suggestions and fail to make payments of tax that are legally due for payment. The sales tax law imposes penalties for late payment of tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment will insert a clearer expression of the effect of the existing law, so that taxpayers will be in no doubt that the passage of amending laws will not relieve a person from a continuing liability under the law. Press reports which suggested that as much as $1 billion may have been at risk if the government had not made this amendment were greatly exaggerated. The purported weakness in the law raises only a question of the timing of certain payments, so that the cost to the government even of the claimed interpretation would have been small. As it is, the amendment preserves what the government believes to be the existing law. Accordingly, there is no impact on the revenue from this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the Nation</EMPHASIS> statement changes to the sales tax laws to give exemption to certain child-care services. This is one of a number of measures designed to make the cost of child care less of a burden, particularly to working mothers. These amendments to the bill will give effect to that announcement. Broadly speaking, an exemption from sales tax will be given to goods for a range of child-care services. These services comprise long day care, outside school hours care, vacation care, occasional care and family day care coordination. Employer sponsored child-care services located on premises owned or leased by the employer will not be entitled to exemption. The exemption applies from the date of royal assent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) affect the starting date for sales tax matters and also include a range of new sales tax exemptions. This committee stage gives me the opportunity to express concern that the matter referred to earlier in relation to second-hand machinery is not amongst those new sales tax measures. I welcome the fact that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) will apparently make an announcement on this matter fairly soon, but that raises the question of the starting date for any new measures. It will be three to four months before any legislation can be brought into the House, carried here and then brought into the Senate for approval and legislative effect can be given to any changes. So I hope that, when the Assistant Treasurer is considering the minute coming to his attention, he will look at announcing an immediate commencement date for any new measures.</PARA></TALK.START>

He should also give consideration to some kind of backdating of the measure. As I mentioned earlier, it is an anomaly that has caused a great deal of confusion amongst second-hand machinery dealers, but one which clearly is not in keeping with the spirit of what was intended in relation to sales tax exemptions. I encourage him to take the first available opportunity to correct that anomaly. I regret that it is not one of the changes that are included in these particular amendments before the committee at the present time, but I hope it will not be too long before we will be debating similar amendments on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The three measures raised by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) are worthy of some comment. The principal amending bill was introduced only a couple of weeks ago. Again, as so often happens, the government has tacked on comprehensive amendments as if to demonstrate what was not needed; that is, the legislative incompetence of the government. The child-care services matter involving sales tax exemption is said to be a natural consequence of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the Nation</EMPHASIS> statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) some time ago. Given that the statement was made some time ago, it seems strange that its effects should come into the committee by way of amendment. If it was such a big deal, as the Assistant Treasurer seems to want to regard it, one would have thought it would have been given effect in the main bill in a timely fashion and not tacked on in this way. The truth is that it strikes me&mdash;and any reasonable observer, I suspect&mdash;as being an afterthought. I wonder why the Assistant Treasurer used the words he did and why he made such a virtue out of what, after all, is merely an afterthought.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am sorry, in a sense, that they will be truncated but, given that we are under the guillotine, I cannot afford to let any moment lapse through inconvenience. We have only one hour to discuss this important bill&mdash;the Migration Laws Amendment Bill 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some points that are very germane to the guillotine and this bill. This bill is to defer the commencement of certain provisions in the Migration Reform Act 1992. I do not recall whether there was a guillotine when the relevant bill was dealt with in this House on 11 November 1992, but I suspect that, given the time of year&mdash;even though it was Remembrance Day&mdash;it was undoubtedly under duress that we were pressing on with the matter. The bill received ready cooperation from Her Majesty's loyal opposition to ensure its passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not offer my comments without some criticism of the government. I refresh my memory by looking at the speech I gave on that occasion. It was against a background of crisis that the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hand, introduced a bill which was seen as being of enormous importance to the government of the day. The bill was to put in place provisions to enable us to address that crisis. Nothing that has happened in the meantime has convinced me that those comments were misplaced then or that the situation is substantially different now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the bill to address that crisis was urgent then, in my view, the act and its implementation are urgent now. I will deal with the crisis now and after the dinner suspension I will deal with the bill. The crisis that was of concern to me, and I think very much in the minister's mind, related to the government's failure over time to address the problem of asylum. We are now facing the problem of a large number of asylum seekers in Australia. I pointed out at that time that 21,700 asylum seekers were seeking sanctuary and pressing claims. Some 500 people at that time had arrived in small boats and were seeking asylum. Many of them were in detention at Port Hedland and some were in Sydney. A number of people arrived by aircraft and were similarly detained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that around 20,000 Chinese students, and additional spouses and dependants who had been allowed to come to Australia since that time, were here at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre. They had been granted a special status which was going to have to be resolved at a future date. A great number of people were seeking to press refugee claims or, in other circumstances, seeking special status. Our previous experience had been of much smaller numbers. They were straining our capacity to handle properly the claims for refugee status. Before this crisis we had dealt with some 500 applications a year. Considering that, the enormity of the problem becomes apparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time this legislation was introduced, the crisis had been with us for almost three years. People have complained about detention. A large number of people have been held in detention and many remain there today. That situation had been with us for three years when we discussed this matter in November last year. Australia is in a unique position to deal with refugee status. We have water boundaries which have protected us from the sorts of claims often made in North America generally. We have not had the same problems as Europe where people have land boundaries. They do not have our insulation. We have a system of universal visa entry which, we have been told, provides us with an enormous capacity to test people's bona fides before they come here. That has given Australia a capacity to test people's eligibility in a way few other countries can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it, when we have these innate advantages, that we are faced with the same sorts of dilemmas as elsewhere in the world? The reasons are very simple. They turn upon the capacity of this government to make decisions in this area. Some of the most senior ministers of the government are culpable in this matter. First and foremost, the reason we are facing difficulties is the large number of Chinese students who were allowed into Australia before the Tiananmen Square massacre. Decisions were taken by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), who was then the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. We knew that the relaxed basis upon which people were permitted to enter Australia had given us a large number of people already overstaying their student entry visas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 40 per cent, according to Senator Robert Ray&mdash;this was confirmed to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations&mdash;of the PRC students in Australia in May 1989 were already overstaying visas. The then Minister for Employment, Education and Training had given us a significant problem by allowing a large number of people here who were not going to honour their conditions of visa entry. Former Prime Minister Hawke compounded that problem&mdash;notwithstanding advice from his colleagues, particularly the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), who had drawn attention to this matter&mdash;when he allowed all the Chinese students here in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre to remain on a basis on which no entrants from any other part of the world would be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that we then faced an avalanche of students seeking to enter Australia and wanting to make the same claims? The only basis upon which they thought they could make claims was refugee status. This was a problem of the government's making and remains so. After the dinner suspension, I will take honourable members through this bill and what the government is seeking to do in delaying the implementation of the Migration Reform Act that was intended to address this crisis. We will look at why legislation designed to cope with this problem is being postponed for another 11 months and ask some very simple questions about the competence of those who are dealing with this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation introduced into this parliament was so seriously flawed, in the government's view, that it cannot be implemented immediately and the program that was outlined as urgent and pressing cannot be implemented. I will go through the arguments in relation to that because it is important to understand that, while we are giving the government the utmost cooperation in addressing this very pressing problem, the government is on notice that, if it is going to continue to handle these matters as inadequately as it has, it cannot expect cooperation in further legislative changes. I will also press strongly for the administration of immigration arrangements to be the subject of wider review. We ought to get to the bottom of why legislation as important as the Migration Reform Bill, as it was&mdash;now the Migration Reform Act&mdash;could not be implemented as was originally planned. There is some culpability on the government for why that has not been possible. </PARA>

At that time I moved an amendment, and I would like to remind the House of its nature because it put at issue a number of factors. The amendment was to this effect:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) deplores the Government's failure to control the refugee determination process, commencing with former Prime Minister Hawke's decision on the People's Republic of China Nationals in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) notes the lamentable time delays in moving to reform the refugee determination system; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) regrets that the further proposals put by the Coalition to limit judicial appeals, to require leave to access review procedures and to redeploy staff to the refugee screening process have been ignored".</PARA>
<PARA>That amendment was moved deliberately because the situation was one of crisis. The government's response was to introduce a bill to reform the Migration Act&mdash;re-called the Migration Reform Bill 1992. It is perhaps timely to refresh our memories about this bill, and we can do so from the explanatory memorandum. It states that the bill will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . effect major changes to the Migration Act.</PARA>
<PARA>It was further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reform Bill continues the process of modernising Australia's immigration law.</PARA>
<PARA>The explanatory memorandum mentioned the major amendments of 1989, following on what was called the Cape report, to allow the government to more effectively control the composition of overall numbers in Australia's immigration program. It went on to talk about subsequent amendments and streamlining that occurred under the former minister. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major themes behind the changes to be made by the Reform Bill are simplicity, clarity, certainty and fairness.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes will replace the legislative framework which currently underpins the regulation of entry to and stay in Australia as well as detention and removal of non-citizens here unlawfully. It will provide a new and greatly extended basis for merits review of. . . decisions and, for the first time, provide independent determinative merits review of refugee-related decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>Then we go through and look at a framework of law designed to implement new arrangements to ensure that our immigration control was effective. It had provisions dealing with entering and remaining lawfully in Australia, and to simplify travel and entry arrangements. It was to provide a single form of authority to be called a visa, to travel, enter, and remain in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took a series of decisions, and each of them was important. It required all persons to undergo immigration clearance on arrival. It included requirements that Australian citizens present an Australian passport or pay an administrative fee to use another passport on arrival from overseas. It put the onus on all non-citizens to prove that they were lawfully in Australia. It created a special category of visa to accommodate those from whom it was impractical to require a conventional visa prior to travel. It put limitations on further applications from non-citizens, apart from a small number of prescribed visa classes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a visa tax on illegal entrants who had been in Australia unlawfully for over 12 months. It provided arrangements for pre-cleared flights to cater for immigration checks prior to boarding direct flights to Australia. It had major changes to detention arrangements, and the removal of non-citizens including the requirement to detain unlawful non-citizens; the creation of a bridging visa to ensure that any release from immigration detention was controlled by certain conditions; a uniform detention regime for all unlawful non-citizens; and a liability for non-citizens unlawfully in Australia for costs of detention, removal and deportation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It further had restrictions on availability of judicial review by narrowing the scope for migration decisions to be appealed under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. It had codification of procedures to be followed by primary and review decision-makers. There was the introduction of an objects clause to state that the object of the act was to regulate entry to Australia and set out the conditions under which stay was permitted. It had the validation of certain third party opinions, and a new criminal justice visitors scheme to ensure that people who committed crimes in Australia were brought to justice. It was seen as a major reform measure by this government, putting in place procedures to deal with the proper detention of unlawful non-citizens. It was seen as being the very fundamental reform that this government could have achieved, and was pressed urgently for implementation last November. It was the subject of a guillotine so that there could be limited debate, as we experience tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we are, faced with a bill that defers the commencement of the provisions contained in this major reform act. Interestingly, when we go through the second reading speech which justifies this deferral&mdash;and I will come to some issues of detail in relation to the deferral in a little while&mdash;we find that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the reform act requires finetuning, and this is to be expected in legislation of this nature. At this stage, a number of minor amendments have been identified, predominantly of a technical nature, which still need to be made to legislation to ensure that it operates smoothly.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister tells us that what is involved is finetuning. This House deals with finetuning of legislation every day. Normally it is slipped into some amendment bill which is passed through with a whole lot of other, very often unrelated legislation, without objection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what the government has in mind here in terms of what it sees as being the defects that require the legislation to be put off for something of the order of eight to nine months&mdash;defects that are of such an order that, except for the implementation of the provisions dealing with the establishment of the refugee tribunal and some amendments to ensure that it is able to operate, do not pick up any of the other major reforms. What does that say about the nature of the legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I and my colleagues do try to help the government in relation to its legislative program. We have been very cooperative, and we wanted to be cooperative in relation to this legislation. We agreed to the government's original reform measures. We saw them as being important. We thought they were worthy of support last year. We would like to see the government implement as much as possible of that legislation. We would like to see implemented forthwith, for instance, the provisions dealing with restricting the availability of a judicial review by narrowing the scope of migration decisions to be appealed under the AD(JR) Act. Why? Because we know that one of the major problems that the government has is in relation to the extent to which the courts&mdash;and more matters are litigated in relation to immigration than to almost anything else&mdash;are involved in redefining and expanding the</PARA>
<PARA>basis upon which people might be able to remain here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we want to do is ensure in relation to refugee determination that the international agreements that we have signed are complied with and that we have in place an administrative regime for determining refugee status&mdash;not one of these broad schemes where people are given the right, first, to an administrative decision; then to an appeal from an administrative decision; then, if they do not like the administrative decision, to go off under the AD(JR) Act to get a judge to have a look at it; then, if they do not like that decision, to move off and have the full court look at it; and then, if they are unhappy about that decision, to trot off to the High Court for it to have a look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we said is, `Look, we think you, the government, ought to remove the possibility of appeal under the AD(JR) Act and put in place the sort of regime that we had for determining refugee status, which was efficient, was fast and was never the subject of any complaint by the UNHCR. You would have a far better, more efficacious system and the delays that you are experiencing and the detention that some people are experiencing of an unconscionable nature could be avoided'. That is what we put very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what did the government say to us? `Look, we have left this all too late: 1 November is the operative date. These provisions would operate by 1 November and we really could not even implement our scheme'&mdash;that is, the government's scheme, which we, the opposition, think is second best&mdash;`that is, simply restricting the availability of judicial review by narrowing the scope of some of the more technical issues that might be raised by parties for a judicial decision'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say I find it extraordinary that legislation as fundamental as this legislation was, that needed our urgent cooperation to ensure its passage, can be the subject of a bill in which it is argued that there are only matters of finetuning outstanding but which require the implementation of the legislation to be put off for another eight to nine months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up this judicial review argument. I noticed in a recent reported case of Roser v Immigration Review Tribunal of 28 September 1992 that Mr Roser was a gentleman who had exhausted all of the remedies available to him through the department and through the Immigration Review Tribunal. He trotted off to get his decision examined by the court. I found what the court had to say very interesting because I think it highlights the problem that we experience in the immigration area. The court said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is apparent that Mr Roser is using the entry permit system of applications and the review and appellate hierarchical structure of the Tribunal and the court to prolong his stay in Australia; that is his predominant purpose and that is an abuse of the process of this court.</PARA>
<PARA>The court went on to say that what he was involved in:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . was no more than a regurgitation of the material that had been placed before the Tribunal on the first application and found to be wanting.</PARA>
<PARA>I would not want to pick up particular cases other than that one in which a court has commented, but I just suspect that when we do get involved in litigation in this area, where the outcome that people are often seeking is merely to prolong their stay in Australia, the situation in which there can be abuse of process is perhaps very much more often the case than we would like to believe. It is a matter of some trouble to me that the government sees fit with this new tribunal to leave in place this attenuated appeal process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I want to make a number of other points. I think that the way in which this matter has been handled has involved very considerable legislative and administrative incompetence on the government's part. I do not want to get too involved again in canvassing matters that I did in the estimates debates but I did draw attention to the matter that my colleague Senator Short and his representative in relation to this debate have foreshadowed in the other place, that is, the possibility of setting up a Senate committee of inquiry into the government's handling of immigration into this country, particularly the departmental arrangements and all of the internal difficulties that have arisen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly clear to me that some of the people who have been involved in projecting legislative reform, and have certainly highlighted the urgency in the past for changes in this area, are no longer involved in the pursuit of the legislative program on behalf of the government. Changes at very senior levels took place after the election. It is not clear from the estimates debates what was the rationale for all of those decisions or the reasons why people were dealt with as they were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned previously the situation of one officer about whom certain allegations were made, who was cleared as a result of the investigations that were undertaken in relation to the complaints, and who has not been reinstated into the position that he previously occupied. Those matters have given my colleagues reason for concern and they give me reason for concern. </PARA>

It just belies comprehension to imagine that something that merely requires finetuning has to be put off for eight months when the major reform proposal, which goes to the very issue of detaining people in custody&mdash;and that was one of the matters that was raised&mdash;is at risk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When there is the potential as there is in this area, for judicial challenge, I am astounded that the government sees the preferable course as being to postpone the implementation entirely while, in the words of the minister, merely finetuning is to be expected and that a number of minor amendments have been identified, predominantly of a technical nature. The only other matter that was advanced in relation to this matter was that the implementation of these complex and important changes needs to be smooth and trouble free. The government said, `We need to train our officers in relation to these matters'. My experience in relation to training of officers is that we do not need eight months to do it and I would be very surprised if, in relation to the Migration Reform Act, that is being done now for what is going to be implemented next September.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) in his speech said that this country had a great advantage because of the fact that it is an island. He carried the analogy a bit further by putting forward a proposition that, in regard to international refugees, Australia is Robinson Crusoe. I want to refer to a few quotes to put this line of argument in context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia might be an island but the reality is that a significant part of the problem the honourable member spoke about has nothing to do with the proportion of people coming here by boat. Australia is not separate from an international phenomenon. I refer to an article entitled `Refugees and Displaced Persons' in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">JAMA</EMPHASIS> magazine of 4 August 1993. The authors, Michael Toole and Ronald Waldman, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, we described the high mortality associated with mass population displacements in developing countries and proposed preventive strategies. Since then, the number of refugees and internally displaced persons has grown by 40% from approximately 30 million to 43 million.</PARA>
<PARA>Does the United States have the ready solutions that we have so apparently missed? I do not really think so. In the Clinton budget, $172.5 million has been allocated to America's refugee and asylum problems. Dirk Kirschten, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Journal</EMPHASIS> of 7 August 1993, made the following point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of an estimated 200,000-300,000 migrants who enter the country illegally each year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the illegals, let alone the huge numbers of legal entrants&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">only 13,000-15,000 claim asylum after being intercepted at international airports or rounded up . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He spoke of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a massive backlog of nearly 300,000 unadjudicated asylum claims filed by immigrants who have managed to enter the country&mdash;both legally and illegally . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So, once again, we might say that we do not have the phenomenon of a border with Mexico or close proximity to Central America but the problem still has to be seen in the international context of population movement, the availability of transportation and the international problems that people are seeking to escape. Hans-Georg Betz, in an article entitled `The New Politics of Resentment' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Comparative Politics</EMPHASIS> magazine of July 1993, looked at the situation in Europe and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is growing concern about the dramatic increase in the number of refugees and illegal immigrants looking for a better life in western Europe. During the 1980s, the number of political refugees in western Europe grew from some 75,000 in 1983 to almost 320,000 in 1989. Since 1989, these numbers have dramatically increased. Switzerland alone counted 41,000 refugees in 1991, and Germany more than 250,000.</PARA>
<PARA>It belies international reality to come here this evening and say that all is hunky-dory and that, if it were not for an incompetent government, Australia would not really have any problems. It is worth saying that, whilst there is some truth in the comments by the honourable member for Dundas about the introduction of the sale of education overseas, we need to be more realistic about the present position. We no longer have 21,000 claimants. Despite the issue of 35,000 student visas last year, there has been a considerable drop in the number of student overstayers. It is no longer the case that that proportion of visa entrants who are overstaying is abnormally high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dundas repeated a lot of the comments he made in a speech on 11 November 1992. He referred to the Tiananmen Square entrants and the problems of the overstayers amongst students. The clear change of policy, the clear emphasis on a greater degree of pre-visa testing and the greater controls indicated in this field have accomplished a lot of what this government sought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dundas spoke about all the warnings members of the opposition gave us and said that they were really on top of the whole policy area. However, I was interested to read comments by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). Admittedly, those comments were not strictly on the migration aspect of this education policy but on the policing of the industry. He described the legislation as `catastrophic and appallingly drafted'. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the bill restricts institutions from marketing courses overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have had countless recommendations about the damage that the trust account mechanism will create for the education export industry, particularly for the private providers. It will create severe cash flow problems for these institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .            . . .               . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Written notice must be given to overseas students as to what amounts will be considered non-refundable.</PARA>
<PARA>In general, in a series of speeches on 15 November 1990 and 20 June 1991, he was at pains to deplore any action by this government to put restrictions on the players in this industry to require a degree of policing by these institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member was very concerned that anything would be done to undermine the saleability of education in Asia. He referred to the lengthy statement of the Industry Commission, which he said, `fully vindicated criticism made by the opposition'. The Industry Commission urged `further deregulation in the freeing-up of this market in order to provide these institutions with a maximum capacity to take advantage of what is a very large international market in this area for education services'. In other words, the whole emphasis of the opposition was not on the fact that our migration situation might be imperilled, but more on its grave concerns that we might restrict a few people from getting a buck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week we saw legislation introduced to further tighten up in this field. Despite the fact that the opposition was so expert, it knew everything, it was interesting to note last week that, despite measures that the opposition deplored back in 1990-91, such as the introduction of trust accounts and a variety of other measures, there was not this same kind of vigorous opposition and intensity of concern. So, for a group of people who know everything and who have all the answers, perhaps it should be said that the matters are not as simple as they have stated them to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This deferral tonight relates to the Migration Laws Amendment Bill which had a number of intentions in relation to unauthorised entry, and which has led to very long sojourns in this country through the use of our legal system by a group of people who, to some degree, the honourable member for Dundas defended very strongly on 11 November 1992, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not find it in the least surprising that those in the legal profession&mdash;given their duties and responsibilities . . . and given the employment difficulties that so many of them have in this recession, also a Government creation&mdash;use their creative endeavours to find their way through the system that the Government puts in place.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is all right for the honourable member to come here tonight and say that he is very concerned that we are deferring these matters, that they are very urgent and that we cannot afford any delays. He knows, as does everyone else in this House, that this area has been subject to a large degree of litigation in the expectation by some practitioners that there would be significant compensation payments down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit hypocritical for the honourable member to say tonight that everything must go ahead full speed and that we should not defer or reconsider. A few months ago he said that there is a reality in this industry, that is, because of employment in the law field, people are using very inventive activities to try to subvert these laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the new Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) had a view that a number of issues in this area should be reconsidered and there was a need to review these matters, then that is pretty understandable, given the history of litigation in this field. Those opposite will appreciate that some of the measures to which the ALP party caucus and the opposition have loaned their support in the last few years and which have been put through this House without objection from those opposite, with a very large degree of complementary support, have been subjected to those kinds of legal challenges and, I am afraid to say, on a significant number of occasions those challenges have been successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what the honourable member has just said, the government has put forward a number of reasons for deferring these very important measures. A significant parliamentary inquiry is looking at the policies of detention for a number of people who are crucially affected by this bill. A large number of client groups need to be provided with information in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the added situation, as the honourable member opposite mentioned, of the training of staff and the drafting of regulations. In addition, it has been found, I understand, that there is a need through this process for extensive and complex alterations to the computer systems and databases. A variety of reasons have been given for deferral, but fundamental to them is the reality that this particular area, as I said earlier, has been subject to significant litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking, as the honourable member says, about a series of very important measures to ensure a more effective control of entry and detention and removal for those who fail to establish their genuine refugee credentials. We are talking about the enhancement of merit review by the Migration Internal Review Office and the Immigration Review Tribunal and, fundamentally, review by the Refugee Review Tribunal. So we are talking about things that do matter. We are talking about a subject that has been a very serious problem for this country. To say that there should be no reconsideration, that there should be no deferral, is not considering the realities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, this legislation does not impact upon and undermine the operation of the Refugee Review Tribunal. It is operating; it is going ahead. Previous decisions by delegates representing the minister have been given increased authority by this bill. The most crucial aspects of the legislation are in no way affected. I support deferral. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has run a curious migration system since 1989. It has two main steps:  grand designs followed by rapid reform. Migration has been vital to the development of Australia. All non-Aboriginal Australians are either descendants of immigrants or are immigrants themselves. Our economy has been boosted by overseas migration, overseas investment and profits from overseas. There are equally important humanitarian reasons to make sure our migration system is fair and functions well. But these economic arguments clearly demonstrate how important it is for national development for Australia to have a sound migration policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration Laws Amendment Bill defers introduction of all the major provisions of the Migration Reform Act 1992. It also introduces some technical arrangements dealing with transitional amendments which arise from the delay. The coalition does not oppose these aspects. However, we want to know why we need this bill. For those of us on this side of the House, the Migration Laws Amendment Bill only highlights the government's legislative and administrative incompetence. The government appears to have been unable to provide an achievable timetable for implementation of the Migration Reform Act when it was considered by parliament in December 1992. Nothing of great significance has occurred in the immigration portfolio in the ensuing months that could not have been anticipated last year. Instead, it appears that the government has simply not taken the appropriate measures to ensure a reasonable timetable to set the workings of the act into motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Migration Reform Act was debated last year, the coalition reminded the government of the crisis in immigration that this country faced. We spoke of the urgent need for reform. That crisis has not diminished, yet the government has been unable to put a coherent solution before this parliament. When, under the operations of this bill, the provisions of the 1992 act finally come into operation in September next year, 20 months will have passed. Last year, the Migration Reform Bill was drafted, debated and passed by the parliament with bipartisan support, ready to come into operation on a start-up date almost 12 months away. Now it has been found to be so badly flawed and in need of such reworking that, with the development of necessary new procedures and preparation of documentation, the start-up date must be delayed. During that delay, the urgency in immigration will not have diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important to remind ourselves about the depth of the immigration crisis this country faces. We now have over 20,000 asylum seekers in Australia applying for refugee status. Around 500 boat people are being held in detention while their claims for asylum are being determined. We have the problem of the 20,000 Chinese students who were in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre, as well as their 7,000 dependants who have come to Australia since 1989 and may seek asylum after June 1994. </PARA>

The government built up the hopes of these people. When faced with applications to remain in Australia, the road to success is a rocky one indeed. Often the initial application is refused, and is almost always followed with an appeal to the Migration Internal Review Office. If that is unsuccessful, another appeal to the Immigration Review Tribunal remains. This process is both costly and emotionally draining. Failure is a personal tragedy for those concerned and their dependents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the former Prime Minister granted the special conditions to the People's Republic of China nationals who were here prior to the Tiananmen Square massacre but were due to return to China, he did much to add to the confusion which surrounds immigration policy in this country. On the one hand, he built up their hopes of starting a new life in a country of liberty and equality; on the other hand, he condemned them to years of ambiguity and potentially shattered hopes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the world today, millions of people are on the move. Australia is fortunate to have a geographical position that protects it from many of the worse aspects of this mass population movement, as my colleague the honourable member for Berowra explained. Western Europe faces a serious problem with a growing tide of illegal immigrants and refugees now entering from the former communist states of the east. Thousands of Latin Americans steal across the border into the United States each year by whatever means they can. In Australia, however, we are relatively lucky in numerical terms. Only about two per cent of all the overseas born people in Australia are here illegally. Unlike those floods of people moving from the Balkans or Mexico, most immigrants to Australia are educated and skilled. However, we have problems and many of these can be tied directly to government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hopeless confusion surrounding the eventual fate of the 20,000 Chinese students seeking refugee status is a spectacular example of the failure of government policy. In the 1980s, the government encouraged Australian educational institutions, some offering courses of extremely dubious quality, to tap into the Chinese market. The demand for these services has collapsed, but we&mdash;and many thousands of PRC nationals in Australia&mdash;are still living with the consequences of this. Many Australians are anxious about the prospect of mass refugee arrivals, despite the relatively low levels of refugee and humanitarian intakes we actually have. These people are concerned about the effects such a massive influx of refugees, plus family members allowed into Australia on humanitarian grounds, could have on this country. Our current economic situation does nothing to assuage their fears. Instead, it opens up opportunities for all sorts of fringe groups to turn innocent concerns into racial tension, which is something none of us want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government or the department has done little to assist the situation. Instead, they are suffering from a hopeless administrative confusion brought about by a virtual state of sclerosis in their refugee policy. There is a clear need for a firm lead from the government on this issue. Tonight's legislation shows just how extensive the government's failure has been. Our processing system for determining refugee status has been put under enormous stress ever since 1989. As I mentioned, many of those seeking refugee status are in detention. Some of these have been held for a matter of years. This matter itself raises questions of human rights. Detention can have a most deleterious effect on these people and adds a whole range of new issues to the question of how we determine refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be argued that this bill is yet another continuation of the reworking of the government's 1989 migration regulations. There is a lack of coherence in the government's handling of these matters. The 1989 regulations needed major amendments and reworking. For honourable members who have been here longer than me, there must have been quite a sense of deja vu about this legislation. We need an immigration policy that is fair, sound and well managed. Tonight's debate clearly seems to suggest that that is lacking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) announced the establishment of a new special assistance category for Cambodians. It provided yet another example of the ad hoc nature of the government's immigration planning. Senator Bolkus's announcement pre-empted the outcome of the current inquiry into detention practices by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations that is due to report in December, to which my colleague the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) referred in his speech. It suggested to potential asylum seekers that if they could reach Australia, legally or illegally, they could well be allowed to stay if they spent enough time in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new category offers no fresh options that would allow refugee applicants to be processed speedily on a fair case by case basis. Most importantly, it fails to limit the wide access migration applicants have for judicial review of government decisions that have caused so many of the immigration problems that we now face. In short, it seems to be a typical bandaid measure that will treat the visible symptoms while we wait for major legislation, like the Migration Reform Act, to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration Reform Act introduced restrictions on the availability of judicial reviews by narrowing the scope for migration decisions to be appealed. A delay in its implementation will cause further log jams in our immigration system and continue to clog the Federal Court. When the legislation was originally debated last year, the coalition moved an amendment to reinforce the importance of this point. The amendment is worth repeating because it was excellent. It was moved by my colleague the honourable member for Berowra, I would imagine. It read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)deplores the Government's failure to control the refugee determination process, commencing with former Prime Minister Hawke's decision on the People's Republic of China Nationals in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)notes the lamentable time delays in moving to reform the refugee determination system; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)regrets that the further proposals put by the Coalition to limit judicial appeals, to require leave to access review procedures and to redeploy staff to the refugee screening process have been ignored".</PARA>
<PARA>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) did not care to take up these amendments at the time. He has now lost his chance, unfortunately. In 1992 the legislation was belated; in 1993 we are now facing greater delays before it can come into operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, no-one ties immigration purely to economic issues. We do not see immigrants only as factors of production that will add value to the national product. However, the area of immigration is tied very closely to the sort of society we all want Australia to be. How governments deal with immigration is watched closely by Australians of non-English speaking and cultural backgrounds. Immigration policy affects each ethnic community in Australia very acutely. We are fortunate that in this country we have developed a tradition of tolerance and multiculturalism. </PARA>

The benefits of diversity and tolerance, and the richness of the contribution that non-English speaking background Australians have made to our society, and now their society, is hard to quantify.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too many commentators have sought to link support for multiculturalism with backing for mass immigration. Some of this has stuck in the public imagination. It does nothing to advance the multicultural ideal, as making high immigration a prerequisite for multiculturalism weakens public support.

The basic reality is that the government has been very responsible in deferring certain provisions of the Migration Reform Act 1992. In fact, in so doing it has given itself the opportunity to look again at a number of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in the contributions of both the honourable member for Berowra and the honourable member for Sturt we had criticism of the government in relation to certain key issues concerning refugees, in particular the Chinese and the Cambodian questions. Yet when the government says, `Look, we are actually going to resolve some of these issues and, in the context of that resolution, we will be in a much clearer position to look at the act again in September 1994', we get criticism from the opposition. It is an inconsistent position. But it is not just that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition supports the Forest Industries Research Levy Bill and cognate bills. The bills before us provide for the establishment and funding of a forest and wood products research and development corporation, which the forest industry has been very sensibly, I think, seeking for some considerable time. To finance the corporation and its activities, there will be a levy on wood produced in and exported from Australia as unprocessed wood and on unprocessed wood and certain classes of primary processed forest products imported into Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst at the present time Commonwealth and state governments do contribute to some extent to research through the various departments and the CSIRO, the Australian Forestry Council, which consists of state and federal ministers responsible for forestry, believes that there is much more that can be done. All major reports on the forest industry, including the Resource Assessment Commission's 1992 forest and timber inquiry, the National Plantations Advisory Committee and the ESD working group on forest use have echoed the urgent need for an enhanced, better coordinated and better focused research program. All believe more research is essential if Australia is to increase productivity and value adding in processing in forests and wood product industries and to manage our forests in an ecologically sustainable way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new research corporation will identify national research priorities and assess research gaps. It will commission, administer and subsequently evaluate research into a broad range of areas relating to wood production, extraction, processing, economics and marketing. Its charter will also include the ecological and environmental impacts of disturbance resulting from wood production, silviculture and management of native forests and plantations. It will not actually undertake research itself but will call for tenders from those organisations which can and do undertake research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with other rural research and development corporations, it will have a higher degree of industry involvement and accountability, and the industry, through the National Association of Forest Industries&mdash;NAFI, as it is known&mdash;will be closely involved in the selection of a board of directors for the corporation. The corporation must prepare a five-year plan in consultation with the industry. It must also prepare annual operating plans for each financial year which are consistent with its five-year plan. The corporation's annual reports will be tabled in parliament and they will be made available to industry. It will be up to the industry to decide the amount of levy payable to provide the corporation with the resources to increase the research effort to an appropriate level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application of the levy will commence as from 1 January 1994. There will be provision for different levy rates to apply to different classes of wood and levies will be payable by the operators of mills taking delivery of wood. The industry has requested essentially four different rates for different classes of wood in relation to the level of the levy. The different classes of wood are hardwood sawlogs, softwood sawlogs, hardwood pulp logs and softwood pulp logs. The levy is payable on not only domestic wood but also imported unprocessed wood. A separate account will ensure that the money collected from imports is spent on research and development relevant to the timber importing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth will provide $1 for every $2 collected from the domestic industry to a maximum of 0.25 per cent of the gross value of production of the industry. The reason for the Commonwealth contribution being set at $1 to $2 and not dollar for dollar, as is the case with other primary industries, is given as being because only half the industry has a primary industry focus&mdash;in particular, of course, that refers to tree production and to small rural sawmills&mdash;while the other half has an essentially manufacturing basis. I note that this seems to be an application of a slightly different principle to that which applies to the dairy industry. The Commonwealth will not match import levy funds, and it is expected that  contributions in a full year from the domestic industry will be of the order of $700,000. The effectiveness of the corporation&mdash;I think this is quite appropriate and advisable&mdash;will be reviewed in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems important to underline that the timber industry has enormous potential for growth in all of its facets in this country. Until now it has largely concentrated on the domestic market and currently provides some two-thirds of Australia's needs. However, Australia still imports more than $2.4 billion worth of timber product, much of it high value pulp and paper products. We export only $775 million worth of product, leaving a very substantial trading deficit getting on for $1.75 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given resource security, the forest industry can, and in my view will, expand. It will increasingly become a prominent value adding industry. It has the capacity to create thousands of additional jobs and it has the capacity to very substantially reduce not just Australia's trade deficit in timber products, but address our urgent need to boost exports and move towards the righting of our trade imbalance. I note that even the ACTU estimates that nearly $7 billion in job  creating investment is currently being held up in this country by what is euphemistically known as green tape. Much of that is in the development of forest products from forests and plantations which are, unquestionably, a renewable and sustainable resource. It is a pity that the government seems little short of paralysed when it comes to making decisions about the future of the forest industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen arguments between ministers about whether exports of woodchips will be phased out altogether after the year 2000. We have seen a failure to obtain resource security for the 1,200 timber mills scattered throughout Australia, many of them small but quite important to the people who work in them, to their local communities and, in the end, particularly in a cumulative sense, to the nation's economic performance. We have seen a minister in charge of forests have the ground cut out from beneath his feet when he tried to reach an agreement that could have helped those smaller companies that were proposing to set up projects worth less than $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only draw the conclusion that the truth is that the government never wanted resource security legislation. It  wanted only to make it look as though it was being friendly to the timber industry&mdash;to the forest industries. By contrast, the coalition's policy was to legislate for resource security without any reference to the size of the project. Small can be beautiful and small can grow. Henry Ford started out with a very small business indeed, but it did not stay that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe the sawmill that wants to spend money on a veneer plant or a drying process, or anything that adds value to timber, has just as much right to be guaranteed supply as does a pulp mill. There have been something like 18 reports by committees of inquiry into the forest industry and I cannot think of any that the industry lost, or that found in some essential way against the industry and its continued opportunity for expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mother of all inquiries was the one done by the Resource Assessment Commission. It took years to complete, used almost an entire forest to produce its report and was favourable to the forest industry. The industry might have expected, quite reasonably, that that was going to be the end of it and that it would be allowed to get on with the job of expanding and developing a strong and vibrant timber industry in this country. Unfortunately, it seems that the only way that the government was able to respond was by having yet another inquiry. This time it was by the Industry Commission and it was also favourable. Will the industry now get the legislation that the IC says is necessary, the RAC says is required, the opposition has proposed, and which is unquestionably vital to the future of the industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition recognises that the most efficient, cost-effective and environmentally sound method of forest management is an integrated harvest system. If a tree is to be cut down for sawlogs, it is important to use every bit of it. This means that there is material that can only be chipped. Apart from pulp mills and the few places in Australia which value add by turning the chips into board which can then be veneered and turned into furniture, the rest is currently exported or far too often&mdash;shamefully, in my view&mdash;burnt on the forest floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, there are still people who really believe that the industry logs native forests just for woodchips. In fact, it is difficult to get rid of chippable material at the moment. The lack of market for forest thinnings and sawlog residue is costing jobs and making sawlogs, and therefore timber, dearer. We have seen whole forests like the Victorian pine forests at Myrtleford ruined because the former Labor state government would not allow them to be thinned in case it upset what might be loosely described as the `deep greens'. That particular government went down owing billions of dollars, to the great cost&mdash;as is now being experienced so vividly in that state&mdash;of its residents, at the same time as it wasted tens of millions of dollars by refusing to thin the forest which guaranteed that much of its resource became virtually useless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of this, there was a time when, unbelievably, it was paying to have the sawlog residue burnt on the forest floor. This was costing the state $10 million a year in lost revenue at the same time as Australia lost $100 million in export earnings from woodchips. It is an absurd situation. It is reflective of the way in which emotion has been allowed to cloud and supplant logical debate where the future of the forest industries in this country is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other things that I think is important to recognise is that, because of the long time between planting and harvesting, it is difficult to get people to invest in plantations in Australia. In terms of building a bigger and expanding industry in this country, it needs to be understood that we have to get the incentives right so that people will invest in farming trees and developing plantations. Taxpayers who plant trees in Australia are often subjected to inconsistent rulings by the Taxation Office, particularly in regard to the definitions of `capital' and `revenue'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the plantation is deemed to be capital, deductions may be allowed only over a 10-year period or even disallowed as coming under capital gains rather than income provisions. Currently, the establisher of a plantation can obtain deductions for the cost of trees and must pay full tax on the value of the trees if he moves to sell the plantation before harvest. However, the buyer of an immature plantation who wants to resell before maturity does not obtain any deduction for the value of the trees. It is important that the government look to getting rid of these tax impediments because we believe that the timber industry is a potential growth industry with a capacity to reduce our trading deficit, provide jobs, prosperity and opportunities, particularly in rural and regional areas of this country. As one who comes from and represents one of those areas, I am very conscious indeed of the urgent need for just such development. We want to see more money put into research and development. This is why we support these bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are on the subject of forests, let me take up a matter which I think has been seriously wrongly reported in recent days. It relates to the Hampshire satellite mill in Tasmania. This mill is not being established to chip old growth forest as appears to have been implied very strongly in media reports in recent days. Nobody in their right mind would chip a log that is suitable for milling because the return from a sawlog is so much greater than the return from chips. About 85 per cent of the wood used in the Hampshire mill will in fact come from the company's own wood farms where trees are grown specifically for the pulp market. The other 15 per cent will come from farm forestry and native forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When sawlogs are harvested, there is always a residue&mdash;logs that are bent; logs that are rotten; logs that, for whatever reason, are not useable for other purposes. This can be turned into chips or, alternatively, is left to rot or is burnt on the forest floor so that the regrowth trees can be given every opportunity and encouragement to grow. The prime purpose of this mill is to supply world-class product for the Burnie and Wesley Vale pulp and paper mills. While many of us would like to see more pulp mills in Australia so that more of these chips could be used in this country, in the meantime, it is certainly better to export chips and earn export income than to burn the residue on the forest floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">North Forest Products owns 125,000 hectares of land in northern Tasmania and 82,000 of those hectares are suitable for eucalyptus production. Currently, the company is planting about 3,600 hectares a year at the rate of 1,000 trees a hectare, or 3.6 million trees a year. This ensures a sustainable yield of more than one million tonnes a year on the current genetic stock and, in the future, double that from improved genetic material. That is just one area where research and development can bring extraordinary results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company has been planting eucalypts since 1956. It increased the size of the plantings in the 1970s and again in the 1980s. It has further developed another 2,000 hectares of eucalypt with private owners. The company plans to expand its tree nursery to about five million trees and plant 5,000 hectares every year. On a recent visit to the tree nursery and plantations, I can honestly say that I was very impressed with the work that the company is doing with the cloning of Tasmanian blue gum and shining gum&mdash;or nitens, as they are so widely known down there. We are leading the world in this work. I was also impressed that 20 per cent of the company's freehold land is kept in reserve for environmental, historical and recreational purposes. The company believes this is part of good management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst in many ways the debate in the past has been healthy in terms of focusing the minds of both the community and the industry on the need to be environmentally responsible and work towards developing a sustainable industry for the future, there comes a time when we have to say that, to a large extent, those desirable objectives have been achieved. We now need to look to the future and ensure that the facts rule and emotion does not cloud judgment. In my view, as a farmer who understands only too well the nature of rotation, growing things in cycles, harvesting and replanting, this industry is well on the way towards developing a sustainable future. We need to support it in that, not just for the sake of the industry, but for the nation as a whole. I believe that can be done in a way that is entirely sympathetic to, and consistent with, the legitimate environmental concerns of the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the industry on the progress that it has made, albeit at times under some pressure. I urge it to continue to maintain a sensible and balanced approach. I urge the government to give this great industry an environment in which it can reach its potential. Having said that, I acknowledge the value of the bills and their objectives which are before the House and I encourage their support. </PARA>

The forest industry of course is a major industry in my area of Victoria&mdash;in both the electorate of McMillan and the electorate of Gippsland, which are side by side in that great part of Australia. The major company Amcor is in my electorate, and it produces much of Australia's paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills form part of a package of legislation to establish and fund a Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation in partnership with industry. The purpose of these bills is to provide for the imposition of a levy and charges on unprocessed wood produced in Australia and a charge on wood and certain classes of primary processed forest products imported into Australia. So it impacts on both the local industry and those who are importing timber into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these bills, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Bill includes consequential amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. The levy and charge on domestic production will be collected at the time that the unprocessed wood is delivered to a mill for processing or when it is exported. The charge on imports of wood and forest products will be collected from the importer at the time of importation. So, once again, I stress that the legislation is treating both the industry within Australia and those importing into Australia on a similar basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All major inquiries and reports concerning the forest industries conducted over recent years have identified the critical need for an enhanced, better coordinated and better focused research effort in the forest sector. These have included the Resource Assessment Commission 1992 forest and timber inquiry&mdash;which the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), alluded to&mdash;the National Plantations Advisory Committee and the ESD Working Group on Forest Use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following lengthy discussions and negotiations with the forest and wood products industries, the government agreed to the establishment of the corporation as a key initiative of the national forest policy statement. Commonwealth funds for the corporation, totalling $4.25 million up to 1995-96, were approved under the national forest policy statement. The corporation is to be established under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. Regulations establishing the corporation from 1 January 1994 were made on 27 July 1993 and gazetted on 3 August. Separate legislation is required to impose the levy on the domestic industry and on imports such as those we are dealing with tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charter for the corporation will be to identify national research priorities and assess what research is being done. It will commission, administer and subsequently evaluate research into a broad range of issues relating to wood production, the extraction of those products, processing, economics and marketing. Its charter will also include the ecological and environmental impacts of disturbance resulting from wood production, silviculture and management of native forests and plantations. These are very important issues, and they will certainly further develop the industry&mdash;an industry which has, at times over many years, been the target of demonstrations by, and the subject of concern of, many people in the community. This sort of approach can certainly do only good for the industry and will further its development in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation will not actually undertake any research. Organisations currently conducting forest industry research will be eligible to tender to carry out research on behalf of the corporation. As with other R&amp;D corporations, the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation will have autonomy and flexibility and, at the same time, be fully accountable to both government and industry. The corporation will also be required to facilitate the dissemination, adoption and commercialisation of the results of research and development activities undertaken. Establishment of the corporation is intended to supplement the existing research effort rather than replace it. This is a very important item. Much of the research effort that is being carried out today will stay in place. It is not intended that this corporation will replace it. However, it is expected that existing research efforts by the industry&mdash;both by private companies and public forest management agencies&mdash;will be maintained and enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Association of Forest Industries fully supports the establishment of the corporation and has been declared a representative organisation for this corporation under the act. The National Association of Forest Industries has been very active in the whole gambit of the forest industries and is a very active organisation. Only two weeks ago I sat in a committee hearing here in Canberra when the executive officer of the National Association of Forest Industries addressed that committee and expressed NAFI's concerns in relation to many issues, including the security of tenure over resources. It is a concern that is an ongoing discussion point between the industry and government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike other rural R&amp;D corporations, the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation is to be funded on the basis of $1 dollar from the Commonwealth for every $2 from industry. This amounts to dollar for dollar matching for the small sawmill operators who, together, account for about half of wood production. But there will be no Commonwealth matching funds for the pulp and paper manufacturers since they are large manufacturing companies and have access to other government assistance through cooperative research centres, the national pulp mill research program and R&amp;D tax concessions. Proposed amendments to the PIERD Act provide that the Commonwealth will match industry contributions on a $1 for $2 basis up to a maximum of 0.25 per cent of the gross value of production of the industry. However, the Commonwealth will not match funds raised from the import charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy and charges, and any future changes to these, will be set by regulation following advice from NAFI. Industry has requested that different rates of levy apply to four classes of wood: hardwood sawlogs, softwood sawlogs, hardwood pulp logs and softwood pulp logs. The levies will be based on the average value for each class of wood. In the case of unprocessed wood exported from Australia, an equivalent charge will be imposed by the Forest Industries Research Export Charge Bill 1993. Industry is still consulting on the operative rate at which the levy and charges are to be introduced. While the legislation sets a maximum rate for a class of wood of 0.5 per cent of its average value, it is understood that the National Association of Forest Industries expects to recommend a rate considerably lower than this initially&mdash;possibly in the order of 0.1 per cent, or between 4c and 6c per cubic metre of unprocessed wood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a few comments on the import charge. The Australian Timber Importers Federation&mdash;an affiliate of NAFI&mdash;has agreed to a charge on imports of unprocessed wood and certain classes of primary processed forest products, including sawn timber, wood based panels, medium density fibreboard and hardboard. In fact, continued industry support for the corporation has been dependent on the introduction of the import charge, which will ensure that importers do not gain a competitive advantage over the local industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation provides that the import charge on unprocessed wood will be the same as the rate of levy applying to domestically produced wood. An appropriate conversion factor will be applied to imports of processed forest products to ensure equivalence with the domestic rate. Based on an initial levy rate of 0.1 per cent of the value of a class of wood, the rate of import charged would be in the order of 16c per cubic metre for sawn timber. New Zealand and US officials have raised concerns about the introduction of the charge. However, it recognises that importers who stand to benefit from the research should also contribute. I do not think anybody would challenge that those involved in the industry, both in the import and local sectors, should also contribute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of direct relevance to importers will be economics and marketing research and development, specifically identified in the charter of the FWPRDC. Importers should benefit directly from research and development in fields such as expanding the demand for wood products in Australia; new market and product developments; fire-related codes and standards; and the use of timber in multiple storey construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the benefits from research to be undertaken by the FWPRDC, New Zealand should also benefit through opportunities for New Zealand forest research organisations to tender for research projects commissioned by the corporation. It is understood that New Zealand is already involved in research and development with some Australian forestry agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that importers benefit from the research activities undertaken by the corporation, an amendment to the PIERD act will provide explicitly that funds raised from this charge on imports must be directed to research and development which will be of relevance to their timber importing industry. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has advised that introduction of the levy is fully consistent with Australia's obligations, the general agreement on tariffs and trade, and the closer economic agreement with New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I commented earlier in my remarks, the industry is extremely important to my electorate, to the total region of Gippsland and to Australia as a major industry. The Amcor operation, which announced in the last six to eight weeks that it has taken over APPM, is one of the major companies in Australia in relation to the forest and wood products industry&mdash;one that I am sure will be part of any research and development in an ongoing way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think any other company in Australia has a better record for research and development than the Amcor company. I would like to put on record not only its achievements in research and development, but the record relationship it has with its work force. It is one of the first industries within the timber industry to have settled an enterprise agreement with the CFMEU union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who would like to visit the Amcor plant in Maryvale, Morwell, in my electorate&mdash;I am sure they would be most welcome&mdash;would see a model for Australia. The workers, through an organisation known as the A-team&mdash;made up of members of the CFMEU who work with management from Amcor&mdash;now virtually operate and run the mill. Management is so confident of the capabilities in the work force that the mill operates virtually with the workers running it. It is a unique situation, one of which they can be proud. The company is very proud of its achievements and I know that members of the CFMEU are extremely proud of their achievements in achieving an enterprise agreement where the union is not just the work force but now a fully-fledged partner in how the mill operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work practices and improvements in productivity are such that if any companies in Australia wish to see what can be achieved by enterprise agreements and good cooperation with the work force, they need go no further than the Amcor mill at Maryvale. I am very pleased that Amcor has been able to take over APPM in Tasmania. That company has had the opposite experience in relation to its work force. We are looking to the stage in Amcor's development when the same level of cooperation between the work force and the company will be standard at the sites that previously were in great difficulty with APPM. What has been learnt&mdash;and the developments that have been put in place&mdash;will be very beneficial to the future development of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always the argument about resource security. It has been raised with me on many occasions and is one of the issues which I am sure those sitting around boardrooms take into consideration very carefully before they make the sorts of investment decisions required for new mills to be put in place. The Maryvale mill is a large producer of white paper. I am sure that in the near future, with the right conditions, the company will announce some very large investment decisions for a further white paper processing plant in that area. We have the resource. We are working towards resource security. Once all those things are in place, the company will make those decisions which will benefit Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke in this House last week in relation to the special country preferences. Indonesia has a country preference with Australia, one that needs to be reconsidered. Indonesia and Brazil in particular are the real competitors with Amcor for this sort of production of paper. Their mills are very much larger than the ones we have in Australia. Investments those nations have made for the future production of paper are such that they intend to be the world leaders by the turn of the century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, through the United Nations, has assisted developing countries. Once again&mdash;two weeks after my last speech&mdash;I put it on the record that it is time we started to negotiate very seriously with Indonesia, on the basis that whilst Indonesia and Brazil need to develop, when the big capitalist money is moved into their nation and very large sums of money are spent on very modern technology, we need to consider very carefully whether we need to provide special preferences for their products in the Australian market. I raise that matter again tonight because it is crucial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures in the Forest Industry Research Levy Bill, the Forest Industry Research Export Bill and the Forest Industry Research Import Bill are good for the industry. But we need the level playing field. I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Punch), who is at the table, to convey to the executive government that there comes a time when Australia may wish to continue to assist such countries as Indonesia and Brazil with their overall development, but we should reconsider whether the special benefits afforded to them in the paper industry have run their course. We are now onto level playing field conditions and we need to compete with those countries, not only on the Australian market but on the world market. We need to negotiate with those countries for a fair and level opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not get that, the people sitting around the boardrooms of large companies, such as Amcor, will always have a doubt as to whether resource security is there and whether the playing field is level, before they make final decisions. I am confident that in my electorate we will see, in the very near future, those decisions being made for the benefit of Australia. Before they are made I am sure that the company&mdash;and the workers in that company&mdash;will be urging the government to move towards a real level playing field so the industry in Australia can prosper and we can further develop our industry&mdash;maybe even to the point where they need our products, the quality products, in Indonesia and Brazil. We may be able to export to them without having to face up to 45 per cent tariff barriers plus other measures which restrict our exports to those nations. I fully support the legislation and recommend that the government keep on its path. It is a positive path, and I am sure that in the long term it will certainly benefit Australia. </PARA>

That bill and the other two bills before us put a levy on logs produced and delivered in Australia, on those produced and exported and on forest products imported. The levy is to fund the Forest and Wood Products Research Development Corporation.

One thing that happened last year that was disturbing to everyone was this government's licence to send large, uncut sawlogs straight to Korea&mdash;if my memory serves me correctly, about 7,000 tonnes. This has to be an example of what not to do. Here we have an Australian resource which we send away to another country. We either import it back with a value added by another country or that country makes a profit by sending it somewhere else. We have to look much more to our resources and say, `How can we do that value adding?'. It is certainly not to send those saw logs, without the value added, to Korea. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Gwydir certainly agrees with that. It is value added. If this research trust comes forward with ways in which we can do this, it will be for the benefit of not only the forest industry but Australia as a whole. I mentioned saw logs. Recently I was in Tasmania talking to the forest industry. I was quite amazed to find the limited number of saw logs that the industry can actually get out of an area. The industry there said it expected to get 10 per cent of the original straight trees that it was looking for. If the industry logs an area for the sawlogs, there is a lot left that goes into woodchipping and what follows from the woodchipping. Part of the problem is that the market for woodchips has fallen&mdash;Brazil has taken over a lot of that market&mdash;and we are getting virtually nothing for our woodchips. Here we have a fabulous natural resource that is not bringing any return to Australia. This is why some of the green groups are saying, `Why do it? We are losing the resource and we are not getting anything back for it'. When we do log, whether it is plantations or some of the forests that perhaps are not of the highest conservation value, we have to look to the value adding through pulp mills and paper mills so that, as the honourable member for Gwydir said, we are not importing $2.4 billion worth of product from overseas. I think we are exporting $775 million worth of product. The figures should be the other way around. We should be exporting so much more than we are importing. We have the land and we hope to have the product to go into it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is disagreement between the greens and the forest industry, which will be an ongoing argument for a long time. I do not think there is any disagreement at the outside. Both the forest industry and the greens will agree that there has to be a national reserve system where forests are conserved. But when we get to the edges there will always be an overlap where the forest industry says, `This forest is suitable for logging; it is not an old growth forest; it is not part of the wilderness and it should be logged', and the conservation groups say, `No, this is part of the old growth forest. It should be part of the reserve system and we have to keep it here'. I do not think we can hope that these issues will be easily resolved. They must be resolved, and I condemn the government for the way that it runs some of these issues, which is government by press release and grandstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are genuine disagreements on the forest policy. The way to solve them is not by making political capital out of them but by sitting down&mdash;as did the forest industry and many of the conservatives groups in the ESD process&mdash;discussing the problems with give and take on all sides and coming to an agreed line on where they can agree and where perhaps they disagree. I think it was of great disappointment to both groups when the ESD process on forests, as with other processes, went into the bureaucracy and simply got lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned that most of the forest is not used for sawlogs. I recently read a quite fascinating article called `Our Timber Cringe', written by Peter Collenette, in which he refers to the possibilities that we have for our timber industry. He talks about the neglected hardwoods in Australia and that for so long we have looked to the exotic timbers for furniture&mdash;rosewood, teak and the Brazilian woods. These have been referred to as the special woods we should have. He points out that in Australia we have more than 70 commercial species of eucalyptus, plus scores of other trees that grow to millable size and produce delightfully varied timber, yet&mdash;rather regrettably&mdash;the journal of the forestry industry was:</PARA>

But other hardwoods are available to us. In fact, Peter Collenette sets out quite a list of the neglected hardwoods we could be growing in plantations in Victoria to supply the sawlogs. These include messmate, yellow stringybark, red ironbark, candlebark, mountain gum, manna gum, narrow-leaved peppermint, southern blue gum, southern mahogany, grey gum, silvertop ash, red gum, and silver wattle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forests are a major issue for conservation groups. The reason for that is not hard to understand. Forests, like everything else, grow on the best and most fertile land. When the settlers came to Australia it was naturally that arable, fertile land that was cleared first for farming. So some of our best forests were removed early on. As farming increased, so more of the forest went. We were left in many cases with not the best we started with but with remaining forests. The conservation groups are now working very hard to save examples of those forests throughout Australia. In those forests we have an enormous biodiversity which we have not yet fully realised. Just as we have not done the value adding in the sawlogs, we have not looked at our forests to see what they can offer to Australia's economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can take a step backwards, I think everybody in Australia now realises the contribution that trees make. Clearing farming land and removing trees has had a disastrous effect on Australia inasmuch as it has caused the raising of the water tables. In the electorate of the honourable member for Gwydir, I have seen areas where the water table is within about one metre of the surface. It has had disastrous effects on the whole area. In my own state of South Australia, we have a massive problem with dry-land salinity. Much of this comes from the fact that we have cleared the forests and the long-rooted grasses. That we need to regenerate has long been accepted. During the last election not enough attention was paid to the coalition's policy on the concept of a permanent revegetation trust. That would have meant the taxpayer would have paid farmers for the planting and fencing of land that went back to revegetation to save the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking a step on from that, I do not think the biodiversity of forests has been appreciated fully in the community. Certainly the conservation groups are very much aware of this and it is one of the reasons that they are so very keen to save what forests we have left and to put more effort into plantations, so that we can hopefully get into fully sustainable logging by the end of the century or, if not, very soon after. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, more than any other country, has a wide range of species in its forests that is simply not available anywhere else in the world. We have not realised what those species offer. I think we are all aware of what was happening recently in Western Australia. I think it was in the smoke bush&mdash;although I might be corrected on that&mdash;that a possible cure for AIDS has been found. This is one very dramatic example, but I am aware that there are many less dramatic examples. One that I know of is the discovery of a plant that excretes a certain chemical that the aphid cannot tolerate. It so happens that we do not have that aphid in Australia but Singapore does. So products from that plant can be manufactured and sold to another country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just one very small example. There are numerous such examples but we have not yet looked at all those plants and at what possible medical, industrial, chemical and biological uses we could put them to. Part of the reason for the biodiversity convention is to have a look at the genetic ownership of plants, because scientists all over the world are guilty&mdash;and Australian scientists are as guilty as anyone else&mdash;of taking plants from other countries, using them to produce products and not giving a return to the other country. Australia stands to lose more than most countries because of our unique biodiversity.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this is one of the reasons why we have to maintain an example of all the ecosystems that we have left, to see what biodiversity is there and what use we could make of it. I also believe we need to maintain some wilderness, but that is another question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking that a bit further, there is the belief in forests as such&mdash;that because trees are good forests are good&mdash;but there is a tendency to ignore the necessity of keeping the understorey. But it is in the understorey that we have that wide diversity of species. I was reading another article in today's paper which indicates what effect there is when the understorey is removed. It was referring to the scarab Christmas beetle and how that has recently been causing dieback to the eucalyptus. The scarab beetle is being blamed for killing off the eucalyptus but the article points out that before white settlement the scarab beetle was actually no problem in Australia. So what has happened that the scarab beetle is now causing dieback to the eucalyptus?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens with farming practices, with fertilisation and the removal of some of the understorey, is that we lose the predators and we get an extremely high feeding ground for those beetles, so we get an explosion of the population. Again we have to realise that, unless we keep things in balance, it is not only our forests that are going to be affected but our very farming land. It comes back to a story similar to when we removed the trees and we got this rise in dry land salinity. If we remove the understorey we break up the ecological balances, we get a loss of predators and one or other species becomes out of balance and attacks our productive capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need to maintain a representative system of forests has been recognised by the national forests policy which has been signed by all states except Tasmania. In conclusion, I would like to look at the agreed national goals. The first goal, which was the focus of this bill, was to increase Australia's national forest research and development effort. One of the high priorities of the coalition is to see value added for our national resources. A second goal was the maintenance of an extensive and permanent native forest estate and the management of that estate in an ecologically sustainable manner. The third one, which I am sure the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) will fully endorse, was the development of an internationally competitive and ecologically sustainable wood production and wood products industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the expansion of Australia's commercial plantations of softwoods and hardwoods so as to provide an additional, economically viable, reliable and high quality wood resource industry. We need three things in our forest industry. We need value added. We need to direct more attention in the future to plantations because we cannot keep logging forests without plantations. I think everybody realises that. We have to replace them with new plantations and we have got to be sensible in the way that we look at those plantations. We perhaps have to look at multiculture rather than monoculture and be sensitive to the effect on the rest of the environment with those plantations. Finally, we have to combine it with a system of national reserves, including all the representative forests in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly is nice to be here this evening to find that the opposition is supporting the Forest Industries Research Levy Bill and cognate bills and supporting the thrust of this government in trying to get value added to our timber products. The forests of Australia have been a major resource to this nation for thousands of years. They were a resource to the indigenous people of this country long before Europeans came here, and let us hope that legislation such as that before us this evening is going to ensure that they are a resource here in this country for the rest of the history of the earth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has only to look around this building to appreciate the beauty, the durability and the versatility of Australian hardwoods. But, unfortunately, this resource is currently being exploited at unsustainable levels in some areas. Our forests have a history of being exploited and being undervalued. Their traditional uses have not taken advantage of their unique qualities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early colonial days of course timber was felled, it was burnt to make charcoal and it was shipped off to Europe in enormous quantities. The roads of London were actually paved with blocks of Australian hardwood. Some of them are still there today. So it was easy to get, and by removing it we were creating cleared farm land. So it went on. We continued to exploit this magnificent resource. This is a tragedy because our native hardwood forests are a unique resource&mdash;they are unique to this nation, to the world of forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Forest Industries Research Levy Bill is an attempt by the government to return capital to the forest industry for research and development so that value adding can be carried out. That way, not only can we generate greater income but also we obviously create jobs. The beauty of it is we will create jobs in those parts of Australia that need them the most, and that is the rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate timber harvesting and processing has been a traditional industry for approaching two centuries. We have had logging and milling. At present there is a glulam mill where selected hardwoods are taken, kiln dried, glued together and dressed&mdash;a tremendous value adding industry. CSR has a hardboard mill there where wood pulp is produced from the offcuts, the timber waste. I have been advised only in the last week that after Christmas this particular mill will be expanding to three shifts a day, seven days a week. That again is indicative of how Australian hardwoods are coming back into their own; how research and development is creating new uses for our hardwoods. That is certainly to be complimented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give an example of what value adding can do to Australian hardwoods. We sell a cubic metre of sawn hardwood for framing, which the United States has taken a liking to over the past decade, for about $300 to $400. If it is kiln dried and stress tested, its value is increased to about $1,200 a cubic metre. A young craftsman who lives in Gloucester is participating in an international furniture exhibition in Japan next month. He uses only Australian hardwood; he does not use anything else. He has won awards for design and small business and he converts Australian hardwood to a value of about $8,000 a cubic metre. That is the sort of thing we can do and that makes our forests entirely sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, in my own electorate, the big debate that is raging about timber concerns the old growth forests and whether we will be allowed to log them. The timber industry wants to get in there to exploit the last of that great resource. I agree with the opposition: we have to look to making our forestry industry entirely sustainable and we have to get busy on plantations. I am a great believer that people who are employed in the timber industry do not particularly care whether they are chopping trees down, milling them or planting them. The important thing is that they have a job and that they can continue to live and rear their family in the town of their choice with their family in their own environment, the place that they enjoy. That is what this bill, essentially, is all about&mdash;providing the funds so that that can happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to raise sufficient funds to implement an effective research and development program under the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. All major inquiries and reports concerning the forest industry conducted over recent years have identified the critical need for an enhanced, better coordinated and better focused research effort in the forest sector. The fact is that the forest and wood product industry has asked the government to introduce a statutory levy on the domestic production of wood. The industry, including timber importers, has also requested a charge on imports of unprocessed wood and certain classes of primary, processed forest products, including sawn timber, wood based panels, medium fibreboards and hardboards. This is a charge on domestic producers and importers of wood and forest products. It should be stressed that it is not a charge on those overseas exporters, those external exporters to Australia. So there is nothing there that contravenes our international trade agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Timber Importers Federation, an affiliate of the National Association of Forest Industries, recently expressed strong support for such a charge. It recognises that importers, who stand to benefit from this research, should also contribute. Economic and marketing research will be of direct benefit to importers and this is an area which will be specifically identified in the charter for the corporation. The charter for the corporation will also be to identify national research priorities and to assess what research is being done. It will commission, administer and subsequently evaluate research into a broad range of issues relating to wood production, extraction and processing. Its charter will also include the ecological and environmental impacts of disturbance resulting from wood production, silviculture and management of native forests and plantations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I digress by pointing out that a study is currently being carried out in my electorate to look at a completely new use of forest product, namely, the production of ethanol from forestry waste. That will be a world first. Ethanol is produced but it is not produced from such material. If this is feasible, a trial plant will be set up for which this government has already granted $2 million. If ethanol is then successfully produced, it will go a long way to reducing our dependence on imported fuels. These are the sorts of innovations, new ways of generating energy in an energy hungry world, that this country has to explore. At the same time such innovations must be sustainable&mdash;`sustainable' being the operative word that has to be present in any policy related to our forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importers will benefit directly from research and development into fields such as expanding the demand for wood products in Australia, new market and product developments, fire related codes and standards and the use of timber in multiple-storey construction. Legislative amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 associated with these bills provide explicitly that funds which have been raised from the charge on imports must be directed to research and development, which will be of relevance to the timber importing industry. This will ensure that importers benefit from the research activities undertaken by the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy and charge on domestic production will be collected when the unprocessed wood is delivered to a mill for processing or when it is exported. The charge on imports of wood and forest products will be collected from the importer at the time of importation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that imports are treated on the same basis as domestic production, the Forest Industries Research Import Charge Bill provides that the charge on imports of logs is to be set at the same rate as the levy on equivalent domestic logs. The legislation also provides that a conversion factor between unprocessed wood and classes of processed wood which has been agreed with the industry will be applied to the levy to determine a rate of charge for primary processed wood products imported into Australia. These conversion factors will ensure that equivalent rates apply between imports and domestic production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of a research charge is fully consistent with Australia's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the closer economic relations agreement with New Zealand. It is also consistent with Australia's broader trade liberalisation objectives, as the charge will not have any protective effect and is not intended to inhibit trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the opposition that the importation of timber to Australia is a national disgrace. We should consider, however, that there are species that we do not grow here and species that are more suited to some uses for which we currently use timber. As long as it conforms with the free trade between our nation and other nations, we will continue to import timber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's native timbers are capable of satisfying a much greater use than they currently enjoy in our current domestic market. I sincerely hope that the levy that will be raised under this bill will go a long way towards servicing the needs and uses to which we can put our own timber and towards solving some of the problems that are certainly facing our forestry industry today. I support the principle that we must look at plantations. We must aggressively attack that particular problem because, as I indicated initially, that will create jobs in the part of Australia that needs them most. I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting the bill before the House this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the Forest Industries Research Levy Bill, the Forest Industries Research Export Charge Bill and the Forest Industries Research Import Charge Bill. The legislation will create the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. The development of a rural research arrangement for the forestry industry has been a reasonably bipartisan one. As the then shadow minister for primary industry, I would claim that the coalition parties established well ahead of the government the need for such an extension of those research arrangements. Our policy was certainly in place ahead of both the 1990 election and the 1993 election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the levy, which will be on a $1 for $2 basis government to industry, which is different from the regular arrangements of dollar for dollar, will raise a million dollars a year once it is fully operational. That is a small addition to the total expenditure of industry and government through the rural research arrangements. The annual expenditure is about $180 million a year. It is a valuable addition. It will add to the research being undertaken in the forestry industries by CSIRO, state departments, private companies such as North Forest Products, Bunnings, Amcor and others and two cooperative research organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of speakers have referred to the net deficit of $1.6 billion in our forestry industry products. We import $2.4 billion of products as opposed to exports of $800 million. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that this situation will change. In fact, I believe that it could get worse. All the best research arrangements in the world, or in Australia, will not do anything to overcome that very bad trade deficit unless there is security for investment to expand the utilisation of our forests&mdash;whether native or plantation. If we fully utilise on a sustainable basis native forestry&mdash;that is only in a small percentage of the total forests of Australia&mdash;new pulp mills and, presumably, eventually new paper mills in Tasmania, south-eastern New South Wales, together with eastern Gippsland, plus extensions in central Gippsland and potentially elsewhere, and new pulp mills with plantations in Western Australia and potentially Tasmania will be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, nothing is happening because there is no security that will encourage anybody to invest the billions of dollars that need to be invested and would be invested if that security was there. No-one will invest that big money unless they are guaranteed a continuing supply of product for the 20 years or so that are needed to recover that investment. No investment is taking place to any great degree in timber mills either to do the value adding that everybody gives lip-service to tonight but conveniently ignores. We can only value add if we have new equipment. For family companies, the basis of the timber milling industry in Australia, that money is just not there because there is no security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government failed dismally in its attempt to bring in resource security legislation in the last session of parliament. Even if the government had been successful with that legislation, it would not have given the resource security to the timber milling industry, as distinct from the big projects for pulp and paper mills, that would have been necessary to generate investment. Remember that there was the famous $100 million exclusion: unless a timber mill was putting in $100 million, it was not in the security arrangement. No timber mill is in that sort of category. A lot of timber mills, as the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) has down in his area, can put in $5 million or $10 million. So we have this terrible situation where $6 billion of potential investment in regional Australia&mdash;which, as previous speakers have mentioned, needs the employment&mdash;could turn around that $1.6 billion trade deficit. It is not happening and this bill will not make it happen. This bill will not do anything towards creating that investment, laudable though this legislation is. Where is that money going? Certainly some of it is going to Indonesia and some of it is going to New Zealand where there is resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the government and to the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee) at the table: if they are sincere in wanting to have resource security in this country so that we can get legislation and investment, then the coalition parties are prepared to talk to and work with them. Resource security was almost achieved in the last period of government before certain phone calls to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) prevented the then minister from being able to stick to his agreement. That agreement would have given resource security. It is essential for this country to have that resource security. I believe that during the last parliament the coalition showed that it was genuine in being prepared to work together with the government to achieve security. As far as I am concerned, that offer still stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going beyond native forests to plantation forestry, the government does not even allow security there. The government&mdash;that includes the Minister for Resources&mdash;has actually refused export licences for plantation forestry. That is absolutely absurd. It is the same as saying that we will put a ban on wheat, wool or some other commodity. In addition to that, there are tax problems if the plantation industry is really to achieve its potential. I quote from the coalition policy for the last election, which I believe seriously addressed this problem so that we could bring equity into taxation for plantation forestry, which at the present time is not there, compared with other forms of alternative land use:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Plantation forestry must be encouraged if there is to be an expanded industry and a sustainable balance between controlled harvesting in State forests and plantations on private property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The long delay between planting and harvesting, even if the tax treatment is the same as for other forms of agriculture, is a significant disincentive to investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However investors who plant trees in Australia are often subjected to inconsistent rulings by the Taxation office, particularly in regard to the definitions of "capital" and "revenue". If the plantation is deemed "capital", deductions may be allowed only over a 10-year period or even disallowed as coming under "capital gains" rather than "income" provisions.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">undertake an inquiry on how to set a cost base for the purposes of capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently the establisher of a plantation can obtain deductions for the cost of the trees and must pay full tax on the value of the trees if selling the plantation before harvest. However the buyer of an immature plantation who wants to resell before maturity does not obtain any deduction for the value of the trees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Review the technical aspects of, and is disposed to amend, section 124J of the Taxation Act to ensure that the buyer of an immature plantation will not be taxed on the full value of the trees, but receive a deduction for the value of the trees at purchase. The buyer will pay full tax on the difference between the buying value and the selling value.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from the coalition policy for plantation forestry. The failure to address the inequity or the disincentives through the taxation system to plantation forestry is the biggest negative against the expansion of that very valuable industry at this time. Once again, if the government is sincere in wanting to see plantation forestry replace the utilisation of native forestry, then it has to address this issue. If it does not, it cannot say that it is genuine or sincere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry comparisons with New Zealand become more and more one-sided against Australia. If we use the comparison of New Zealand's forestry industry against ours, we have a similar situation. New Zealand shows what can be achieved with a policy that encourages plantation forestry. At the present time the two glamour industries of New Zealand&mdash;at least in agricultural and forestry terms&mdash;are the New Zealand dairy industry, which is the largest exporter of that country, and the forestry industry, which is the third largest. The forestry industry has the greatest opportunity for the future of any primary or secondary industry in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be a somewhat similar situation in Australia, because we have greater opportunities and potential than New Zealand for plantation forestry, but it is not happening.

The honourable member spoke about resource security. I remind him that it was his own party that voted against resource security in the Senate. It was his party that opposed it and voted against it by joining with the Australian Democrats. He cannot run away from that fact. I do not know whether he had deals going left, right and centre&mdash;I have not heard of them&mdash;but he tried to raise them in his speech. He also raised the matter of resource security and threw out a challenge to the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee), knowing full well that two Greens control the balance of power in the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member promotes a negative position by maintaining that the New Zealand forest industry is better than ours. It is typical of those opposite&mdash;particularly members of the National Party of Australia&mdash;that they hold up other countries over and above us and are always talking Australia down. That is something that occurs frequently in this House. I wish those opposite would consider the effect of their negativity on these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member talked about the increased demand for New Zealand's forest products in the Pacific rim. There are several reasons for that. Firstly, there is an increased demand for timber and forest products generally in that area. There is also the effect on the American industry of its administration's decision with respect to conservation of the spotted owl. That has considerably reduced the amount of timber coming out of America and has also led to the increase in forest product demand in the Pacific rim. I support the honourable member's position on taxation&mdash;getting taxation regimes right for the forestry plantation industry&mdash;and I think the government will work towards that end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills form part of a package of legislation to establish the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, which is to be developed in partnership and with the cooperation of industry. The levy and charges will be set by regulation on the basis of any relevant advice from the industry, in particular the National Association of Forest Industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is still some discussion occurring on the rate at which the levy and charges are to be introduced, industry has indicated that the different rates of levy will apply to five classes of log, namely: hardwood sawlogs; softwood sawlogs; cypress pine sawlogs; hardwood pulp logs; and softwood pulp logs. For unprocessed wood which is produced in Australia and exported, a charge at the same rate as the levies imposed on domestically processed logs will be imposed by the Forest Industries Research Export Charge Bill 1993 when the wood is exported. This bill also provides that equivalent rates will apply to imported and domestic production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation sets a maximum rate for a class of log of 0.5 per cent of its average value at the mill door to ensure that no one sector of the forest industry bears a greater responsibility for the industry's contribution than others. Indeed, it ensures that the industry overall is not levied excessively. Levies and charges will be collected in accordance with the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 and will be paid into a separate account, together with the Commonwealth contribution, under the administration of the Forest and Wood Product Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills mark an important new phase in forest industry research and development which will enable existing research activities to be better focused and coordinated. The establishment of the corporation will be a sound investment in the future of the industry and should lead to significant advances in forest production and our ability to add value to our forest products. This in turn will help to build competitiveness, internationally and between other domestic materials, and will expand the productive capacity of our forest industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forestry is an extremely important industry to Australia. The National Association of Forest Industries Ltd pointed out in its discussions with the caucus primary industry and resources committee that forest and forest based industries have an annual combined sales turnover of $10 billion and directly provide jobs for about 85,000 people in forest management, timber harvesting and downstream processing. The downstream processing includes sawmilling, veneers, joinery, paper and paper products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian Bureau of Statistics figures as at June 1991, in respect of manufacturing industry in Australia, show that the manufacturing component of the forest sector employed 61,700 people. The forest sector employed 6.4 per cent of the total manufacturing work force, and 6.3 per cent of the total manufacturing wages bill. In comparison with other manufacturing sectors, the forest industries employed 9,700 more people than the chemical, petroleum and coal products industries. It employed 6,100 more people than the clothing and footwear industry, and only 1,700 fewer people than the motor vehicle and parts industry. It is, therefore, a very significant part of our work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forest industry realises that regional growth and prosperity can be achieved only through ecologically sustainable development, and that to this end there must be improvements in all aspects of forestry. Improvement can come about only through proper research into and development of our forestry methods and wood products. The forest sector has the potential to make a larger contribution to Australian employment, our balance of trade, and our quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research and development corporation can consider the use of new wood technologies and new wood products.

These have now gone but there is potential for replacing their role by ensuring the regional development of our technically advanced industry, both in forest maintenance and the development of private land for forestry. Tasmania has much to gain from furthering research into, and development of, forests and forest products. I am heartened by this legislation and look forward to the betterment of the industry whilst it provides more jobs and more opportunities for the people of Lyons.

As the House has heard previously tonight, the coalition does not oppose the bills, nor does it oppose the creation of a Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, which will be established under the omnibus Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill. The coalition supports the bills for the simple reason that a corporation along these lines has, over the course of the past two elections, been part of coalition policy. Those of us on this side of the House are very pleased that the government mimics yet again a coalition policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The creation of a forestry research and development corporation is long overdue and greatly needed. I know all too well that the industry has suffered a long investment drought. It is necessary only to have looked at the CSIRO's old Division of Forest Products as it struggled to obtain industry funding for its important research programs to have recognised the scale of this problem. In some regions throughout Australia little more than a tractor has been provided over the past decade, let alone a heavily industry funded research program. That is particularly true in the area of East Gippsland, one of Australia's primary forest regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this is clear enough: as a result of Labor Party policy over the decade, the forest industry has been racked by uncertainty flowing from the actions of Labor administrations, both nationally and at the state level, and especially so in Victoria. Erratic intervention by governments in the management of forest resources has massively destabilised the domestic timber industry. The fact is that we have a timber trade deficit amounting to almost $1.7 billion annually. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A $1.7 billion deficit. The honourable member for Murray will be interested to know that in 1992 imports amounted to $2.5 billion and exports were at $0.775 billion. It is not just a function of inadequate research inputs but an expression of the underlying malaise in the industry sponsored by the uncertainty injected into its operations by governments. As the honourable member for Murray stressed earlier on, more research on its own will not cure this fundamental problem. Only a stable and defined policy which is able to run its course over time will revitalise the industry and encourage new investment in value added activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition welcomes the passage of the requisite bank of bills to establish the R&amp;D corporation, we also need an industry which will be able to contribute strongly to that R&amp;D effort and take up and commercialise the outputs from that effort. The last budget, which raised transport costs which are such a massive cost component of the industry, is nothing but destructive of this end. In view of this, the opposition and the industry find it very hard to swallow the self-congratulatory tone the government has adopted in introducing these bills. Not only is the bill lifted from the coalition's primary industry policy, but also other budgetary measures have served to undermine its capacity to bring any real change to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will also recall the debacle of the government's 1988 and 1989 efforts to rewrite the rule book on the timber industry strategy as it affected Victoria which, far from being an industry or resource policy on the part of the Commonwealth government, was merely part of a political ploy. In more recent times we have seen the government again try to introduce resource security policies, which injected even more uncertainty into the industry and directly discriminated against small sawmillers and innovative companies, and which it now looks to so that the timber products deficit can be wound back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The East Gippsland forest region in my own electorate of Gippsland is a testimony to this situation. The East Gippsland forests, which are predominantly&mdash;in fact 86 per cent&mdash;old growth forests incorporating mature and overmature trees, are nothing other than a major resource. They cover one million hectares of public land&mdash;five per cent of Victoria. The region is remote and has a population of the order of slightly under 10,000 people, about half of whom owe their livelihoods to the forest products industry. In fact, there are about 30 mills operating in the East Gippsland area and also a range of haulage companies and associated businesses. Even more workers, especially those employed by the APM pulp and paper mill at Maryvale in central Gippsland, have their livelihoods tied to the forest resource base in this region. East Gippsland has been hit hard by constant changes in Labor government timber policies and small timber towns such as Cann River, and even larger ones such as Orbost, have suffered terribly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1988, sawlog allocations have been cut in half, down from 345,000 cubic metres to 179,000 cubic metres. Some 50 per cent of the old growth forest area is off limits to the industry owing to the expansion of national parks and other conservation reserves which have been put in place over the last decade. A further 20 per cent have been put out of reach of the industry by the Victorian code of forest practices for timber production, which has force of law. All up then, 70 per cent or so of the East Gippsland old growth forest resource is essentially placed in reserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The region also has a vastly underutilised resource just lying on the forest floor, some 700,000 cubic metres of residual wood which, as woodchip, is worth about $75 per tonne. That is four times the export price for an equivalent amount of iron ore or 70 per cent more per tonne than the going rate for steaming coal. Mostly, the potential woodchip supply from the region would be surplus to domestic needs and, therefore, it would be focused on the export market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the continuing uncertainty of federal government export policies and the continuing hangover of the woodchip policies of the former Cain-Kirner state governments, markets for this resource have not been developed and huge earnings have been lost over the decade. The loss of earnings has been of the order of hundreds of millions of dollars and it is all rotted away on the forest floor because of the political opportunism of federal and state Labor governments. If this has not been bad enough, the East Gippsland timber industry now faces a campaign from extreme environmental groups which are trying to suffocate it completely. These groups are arguing for a blanket embargo on native forest logging and they refuse to accept a reserve system which does not completely ban timber industry activity in all forest areas regardless of its ecological health, level of maturity,  use history and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said previously, some 70 per cent of the region's old growth forest is off limits, as it is to the industry. That is an impressive reserve system but, despite this, the Green groups keep asking for more and more concessions and, by so doing, they seek nothing less than the extinction of the timber industry in East Gippsland. This is despite the fact that they are up against good scientific evidence that the industry is able to work within a sustainable timber yield which fits comfortably with the national forest policy. It is typical of the extreme Green groups which target East Gippsland forests that they will either ignore official reports or totally distort their meaning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to stress the point again, the existing reserve system, which quarantines 70 per cent of the region's old growth timber resource, is well above the threshold required by the national forest policy. There is no further need for reductions in the region's yields. The industry knows that and, as long as it separates out what it means by wilderness areas and old growth forests and adopts a sensible approach to prescribing forest values, the federal government will come to realise the same point as well. I also believe that, once the community has an opportunity to examine the forthcoming study into old growth forest values in the East Gippsland region conducted by the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, we will see that access to the forest base can proceed on a stable and sustainable basis and the East Gippsland region can maintain a forest system which is vigorous but which maintains a healthy regard for established forest values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Green crusade against the East Gippsland timber industry continues to ignore material such as this. It will continue to demand that anything less than a 100 per cent reserve system is inadequate. It constantly equates old growth forest with wilderness and confuses the public debate. It calls old growth trees ancient trees in a studied attempt to manipulate community opinion. If the East Gippsland timber industry and the whole effort to achieve a policy outcome which is based on sustainable principles is to win through, it will require a great deal more community responsibility on the part of the extreme Green groups than any of them have displayed to date, and it will require that they listen to the evidence as well. They need to understand that the national forest policy allows for the retention of only representative old growth reserve systems and does not aim to ban old growth logging. They need to appreciate that the Resource Assessment Commission's forest and timber inquiry offered a choice of timber and forest management options&mdash;not just one&mdash;which would have seen the end of old growth logging. They also need to recognise that the findings of the ecological sustainable development working groups on forests also claimed that, if a reserve system which protected ecologically mature stands could be put in place, then other mature forests could be managed for purposes including timber production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, therefore, a framework that can be devised which will allow for the maintenance of biological diversity of forests but which also permits the sustainable flow of forest products. The industry recognises this. The community recognises this. All the major forest inquiries recognise this. The federal government's national forest policy even endorses the same proposition, but the Greens do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the manner in which the East Gippsland timber industry has been undermined over the past decade, it still shows remarkable resilience. In recent weeks, East Gippslanders have seen the investment drought break in the forest products industry. Last week East Gippsland's sawmilling industry won $2 1/4 million in new investment. The investment, though far from the large amount needed to restore the vigour of the timber industry, followed approval by the state Minister for Natural Resources, the Hon. Geoff Coleman, of 15-year extensions to two existing timber processing licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new investment is set to target new value added timber processing facilities&mdash;the very kind of activity the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) keep harping on about but do little to sponsor. Two well-known and respected East Gippsland companies, T.J. Andrews based at Newmerella and Smith Brothers based in Orbost, are to lead the new investment push. With longer licences, the companies are confident they can capitalise on East Gippsland's forest base and add more value to local timber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst T.J. Andrews' investment plans is a scheme to rebuild its mill and boost sawn wood production from low-grade timber. This investment alone is worth $1 million. Local firm Smith Brothers will spend another $1 million on new kiln drying, reconditioning and further processing technologies. With any luck, even more investment can be expected from timber processor Monier which has also had its sawmilling licences consolidated and extended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, because of uncertainty arising from government intervention in the industry in the past and because of the lack of confidence in wood supply, much of the investment in timber processing has bypassed East Gippsland. There has been about $60 million in new investment pumped into the forest products sector over the last five years, but next to none of this has gone into the East Gippsland region. Some companies, however, did not give up hope and continued to believe the sawmill and timber processing sector could still flourish if allowed to operate in a climate of certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coming of the Liberal and National Party state government has done much to rekindle confidence and those East Gippslanders involved in the forest products business, and who have survived the last decade, are seeing some rewards for their patience. There is now every hope that local timbers can be used for high value added products. The days when native hardwood timbers were destined solely for the commercial housing market are diminishing. Local East Gippsland timbers now have opportunities for specialist applications which command premium prices. This is an objective the federal government should heartily applaud and approve, even though it has all taken place despite it, not because of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise tonight to speak on the Forest Industries Research Levy Bill and cognate bills. As you would no doubt be aware, the timber industry has played a major role in the economic development of my electorate, as it has in a lot of the electorates up and down the mid-north and north coast of New South Wales.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that the introduction of this legislation is quite timely. I think it has already been said that the opposition is not going to oppose these bills. It is quite timely that something be done as far as research and development in the timber industry is concerned. Certainly, in the area of establishing inventories of what exists in some of the more contentious parcels of forest that are proposed for logging, we see, day in day out, the timber mills, the industry and the Forestry Commission in New South Wales arguing the case as far as EISs and FISs are concerned, without any statistical base as to what exists in those compartments as far as flora and fauna are concerned. I hope that, as a result of these bills which are before the House tonight, that situation may be addressed seriously so that in the future those sorts of arguments and debates can be factually based and not based more on emotion than anything else, as they have been in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with a great deal of pleasure that I speak tonight in support of these bills which deal with the establishment and funding of a Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. I was glad to see this omnibus package come before the House this week. I was also glad to get the opportunity to speak on these bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forestry industry today is one industry which has enormous untapped potential. It is an industry that is sustainable if managed properly. I do not talk of potential in terms of resources available; I talk of potential in the sense that the forestry industry is a long way from best practice techniques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is a long way from recognising the value of small millers and the contribution they can make to the industry as a whole. A few of the previous speakers made reference to the resource security legislation that was debated at length in this House last year. Unfortunately, I was not here and was not able to be a part of the debate on that resource security legislation. The stumbling block it seemed was the threshold as far as who would be included and who would not. I put it to the government that, in considering future resource legislation, there should be no threshold. The government cannot say it will look after the industry that has a turnover bigger than $100 million a year to the detriment of all the small mills. That is when we will see monopoly situations exist in the timber industry right throughout Australia. If the government is fair dinkum about resource security, it will get bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that it is vitally important that, from here, the legislation be dealt with in the proper fashion. The first step is the recognition by this government that we actually need a forestry industry in Australia. We need the government to make the commitment that we do need a forestry industry and that the forestry industry in Australia definitely has a future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government currently has in place a very strange policy for the forestry industry in general. In an attempt to win electoral support, the government has bowed to the environmental movement and placed incredible bureaucratic regulations on the forestry industry. Yet, at the same time, it is importing $2.4 billion worth of timber to meet the needs of an expanding and growing Australia. We have in place in Australia an embarrassingly self-righteous environmental policy with regard to the forestry industry. We do not mind ripping up the forests of South-East Asia or the forests of many other developing countries simply to meet our own timber needs, but at the same time we are kidding ourselves that we are being environmentally friendly by just about shutting down our own forestry industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia at present we have some of the most stringent regulations that must be met and, more often than not, cannot not be met by this country's timber workers and timber millers. With these guidelines in place, we cannot meet our current needs for timber in Australia. So what do we do? We rape and pillage overseas forests where regulations are not as strict and then we kid ourselves that we have not sacrificed our principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise my point by referring to a sawmiller within the electorate of Lyne. A few weeks ago I contacted him specifically in regard to this legislation, having got notice that it was coming before the House. He was not out putting in place best practice management strategies for a well-balanced approach to forestry. He was not out making his company streamlined by putting in place the best approaches for cutting overhead expenses and general wastage. This sawmiller was sitting at home trying to put together not one, not two, not three, but four separate environmental impact statements, any one of which, if it had gone astray, could have shut down his whole operation and put his employees out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I felt the necessity to speak on these bills tonight on one hand to support the bills but, on the other hand, to place on record my view that the forestry industry desperately needs a shake-up. I hope that this omnibus package will be the catalyst for that shake-up. There is no investment incentive in the timber industry and there is no capital input into an industry that this government is frightened to support. I must say that, while these bills are worth while, they will mean very little without some form of supporting resource security&mdash;without an entry level, without a threshold. We must have fair dinkum resource security. Unfortunately, as many in the timber industry within my electorate have told me, no amount of research and development will be beneficial unless the supporting resource security is also present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat the main thrust of my argument: it is time in Australia that the federal government made a tough decision with regard to the timber industry. Does the government really want a timber industry? Does the government really support a timber industry? Does the government really believe in the  benefits of a timber industry? Without this initial recognition and support by the federal government, the bills that will pass through the House tonight will amount to nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In preparing to address the House tonight on this issue, I contacted not only a number of the mills in my electorate but also a few of the organisations, such as the Forest Products Association and the National Association of Forest Industries, that have been involved in putting together submissions. It seemed to come through fairly generally&mdash;as is always the case when a government, regardless of whether it is a federal government or a state government, is setting up a body such as this corporation&mdash;that the industry wants proper representation. It does not want just hand-picked people from the National Association of Forest Industries or from the Forest Products Association, or people representing the larger sections of the industry, but fair dinkum representation right across the industry&mdash;from the people who turn over a million dollars a year, to the people who turn over $100 million a year. This legislation, and the research and development corporation that it will put into place, may be effective and have the desired result, but it will stumble on the rocks and perish if there is not proper and genuine industry representation for the supervision of the board. The Forest Products Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst it is true to say FPA opposed the concept, that opposition was based on the requirement that resource security should come first. The principles and importance of an R &amp; D Corporation are recognised and endorsed.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only issue we have raised with NAFI is that we believe FPA, representing the majority of the indigenous industry in NSW, most of whom are not individual members of NAFI, should have a seat on the R &amp; D Corp. Board.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the minister would be cognisant of these opinions put forward across the broad spectrum of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the timber industry has an important role to play in this country's future, the forestry industry has enormous potential. What we are debating tonight will, hopefully, be the first step towards a more efficient industry with more capital input from more enthusiastic shareholders. The opportunities for research and development within this industry are enormous. The buzz words in Australia at the moment are `value adding', and this is an industry that has so much potential in the value adding area within the infrastructure and the mills that are already in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must recognise the importance of the smaller sawmillers. I have made this a theme throughout my address tonight and I cannot emphasise it enough. As small business is the backbone of this country, small sawmillers are the backbone of the timber industry. If we neglect them, we neglect the timber industry and its future. We must remember that currently only the big players are represented by the National Association of Forest Industries. We must not let them also dominate the interests of the R&amp;D program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this to be an exciting rebirth of the timber industry, and we have the best climate in the world and the best forest types in the world for sustainable plantation style industry growth. The steps that take place from here on are probably more important than the steps involved in getting this bill through the House tonight. The industry, as a whole, including the small sawmiller, must be given a say in how this R&amp;D program is established and how its ongoing performance is monitored. I wish the industry luck and every success in establishing a balanced, representative, powerful and sensible research and development organisation. I challenge the government tonight to make a decision about the timber industry, whether we need to support and streamline the industry for it to become as efficient as possible, or whether we continue being environmental hypocrites and rape and pillage forests from overseas countries to meet our growing demands for timber while placing incredible burdens on the timber industry in Australia in a superficial attempt to say that we are caring for our environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just go over a couple of key points that I think we cannot stress enough in this debate. Going hand in hand with this legislation to establish this research and development corporation there must be responsible, representative resource security legislation. We must have, in the national interest, legislation in place that not only protects the larger millers of Australia, but also protects the smaller mills&mdash;the family-owned operations that might employ half a dozen people. They deserve to have their interests looked after by this government, the same as the large organisations have their interests looked after. That sort of resource security will get bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity is now before the government to take a major step forward in the protection and the nurturing of the timber industry in Australia, which, with this legislation tonight, really is going to turn the corner from being an industry that has been bound by just harvesting the resource that is naturally grown in this country to one that provides a sustainable resource of plantation growth, not only softwoods but also hardwoods. The possibilities are limitless if we give the industry encouragement and scope through the moves that we are taking tonight. We must give it the guidance to go in that direction, with government support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I reiterate the point that was made by the Forest Products Association&mdash;that the government look seriously at the representation of industry on the R&amp;D corporation and that that representation be not just from the pinnacle of the peak bodies but from across the grassroots level of the industry so that we have all the aspirations and the genuine ideas that are founded on years of practical experience put forward to this very important organisation. As I said earlier, the opportunity is here before the government to commit itself to the future of the timber industry in Australia. It has the opportunity to make a commitment to the timber industry's future, and ensure those jobs are secure. We can secure that resource and this industry, which will remain as a major industry in regional Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I talk about the Forest Industries Research Levy Bill and cognate bills I want to reiterate something I say very often; that is, that the `p' in politics stands for people. Tonight, in talking about the Australian forest industry, I want to talk about the people concerned&mdash;because forests are very like people; they are renewable resources. Sometimes we tend to lose sight of that, particularly in terms of forests&mdash;but they are a renewable resource.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that, because I had the opportunity of living in a forest area for some years in a little village called Timmsvale up on the eastern Dorrigo plateau, in the hills behind Coffs Harbour. It is a forestry area with families who have been involved in forestry operations for generations. Right at the start I want to pay tribute to those people who work extremely hard in the forests, in a very dangerous industry. I could not possibly begin to count the number of my friends in the forest industry who have fingers, thumbs, hands or arms off; whether cut by saw blades or crushed by falling logs. It is a very dangerous, but important, job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think back to the families in the area where I lived; the Timms, the Mulhearns and the Seccombes. While I never met him, I recall the memory of old Tommy Timms who in 1906 walked, carrying the corrugated iron for his first hut on his back, all the way from Ulong to Timmsvale. This man was a pioneer and an innovator. He built the first water-powered sawmill in Australia&mdash;a very significant development. Others included Paul and Paula Lindsay. It is not only men who work in the forest industries, the sawmills, but women as well&mdash;and they make a tremendous contribution. John Rhodes and his late brother, Bill, operated a little bush sawmill and worked extremely hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these people love forests and trees. Lyle Timms, the son of Tommy Timms, is a sawmiller who hates to cut down trees. This is so widespread throughout the forest industry. I think of places such as Bostobrick, Dorrigo, Megan, Cascade, Ulong, Timmsvale, Lowanna&mdash;all of the forest areas of the Nambucca Valley, the Bellinger and the Macleay. I mention Briggsvale in particular because earlier this year the mill at Briggsvale burnt down, with the subsequent loss of 40 jobs. </PARA>

That had an impact right across the Dorrigo and eastern Dorrigo plateaus. This gets us to the nub of the forest industry argument&mdash;the loss of resource security. The Briggs family was operating the mill at Briggsvale. Juel Briggs is a very efficient woman. How can the family reinvest millions of dollars in a new mill, after one has been burnt down, without some form of resource security? No people in their right minds could possibly do that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would not. I wanted to start by paying tribute to those people, because they are extraordinarily important. It is not just those who are working in the sawmills; it is the logging contractors, the bush workers, the haulage contractors and those employed by the fuel outlets, the tyre companies, the machinery workshops and so on. Up and down the north coast&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, you are aware of this&mdash;we have seen a tremendous loss of jobs in the logging industry for a variety of reasons, mainly because of extreme environmental activity, but also because of the lack of resource security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to dwell on that because I think it is very important. Australia should realise that if we are going to develop forestry as it should be developed&mdash;and have the investment&mdash;there must be resource security. In passing, alluding to the fire that burnt out the Briggsvale mill, the social effects are very difficult to identify. I had the privilege of attending a multidenominational memorial service held in what was left of the mill. It was a very moving experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The communities in that area are still under considerable stress. It is one of those things that people do not pay sufficient attention to. The coalition has always supported the need for forest and wood product research and a development corporation along the lines of other primary industries. We need to have accurate and factual information about the timber industry. There is a great dearth of factual information. There is a lot of emotion and a lot of garbage talked about the timber industry. Sadly, the fanatical, extreme preservationists have been bandying about propaganda which has been very hurtful to the timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this is a time when we have to come together. We have to stop the confrontation. We have to stop those fools putting up tripods in the forests and digging holes in the roads and putting themselves down them and we have to get together and talk as rational, reasonable, sensible human beings. There is an answer. I come back to point I made first, which was that forests are a renewable resource and this is the way we should be approaching this matter. There should be a commonsense approach right around Australia so that we can see sufficient investment, so that we can go ahead and renew those forests and keep our timber industry going for a considerable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the major reports on the forest industry, including those of the Resource Assessment Commission's 1992 forest and timber inquiry, the National Plantations Advisory Committee and the ESD working group on forest use have echoed the urgent need for an enhanced, better coordinated and properly focused research program. More research is essential if Australia is to increase productivity and value adding processing in forest and wood product industries and to manage forests in an ecologically sustainable way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the key to it. We must manage our forests in an ecologically sustainable way. That does not mean locking them up forever. It does not mean leaving them in their so-called pristine beauty to die. It is a strange thing but trees are plants; they are living organisms, and they die. So what we need to do is to manage forests sensibly and rationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timber industry has an enormous growth potential. Until now, we have largely concentrated on the domestic market. We still only provide two-thirds of Australia's needs and we import more than $2.4 billion worth of product&mdash;much of it high value pulp and paper products. We should be value adding in this area in Australia. It is absolute economic madness not to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We export $775 million worth of forest products. This leaves us with a trading deficit of $1.66 billion. That is stupid. We are not using the land mass we have in Australia. What we need from the federal government is not just more research but sensible taxation policies which will enhance the possibility of people putting in more forests and making it profitable to do so. We can reduce the imports of timber products by value adding. This is absolutely essential if the industry is able to be competitive and capitalise on the resources we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Forests and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation would be a body corporate with day-to-day autonomy and the flexibility to operate similarly to commercial operations. It can identify national research priorities and assess research gaps. We need to commission, administer and evaluate research into a broad range of areas relating to wood production, extraction, processing, economics and marketing. Once that corporation is established, it will have a high range of industry involvement and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a very big focus on the conservation of our environment in recent years. Quite frankly I welcome this. Anybody who thinks that we can neglect and rape our environment is absolutely crazy. Everyone in this country has to be conscious of the need to look after what we have got. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Timber is a renewable resource but other things are not. It is the responsibility of every Australian&mdash;whether they be in this parliament or whether they be a schoolchild&mdash;to be conscious of the need to conserve and look after our environment. That comes back to the need for rational, reasonable and balanced management of our forest resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be a balance between keeping people in jobs in the forest and timber industries and keeping our environment to be enjoyed for future generations of Australians. Those two objectives are not incompatible. With goodwill and commonsense we can continue not just to log our existing forests, but enlarge our forests&mdash;as we have been doing and as we must continue to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, those two objectives are not incompatible. We can continue to provide jobs in the forests and we can continue, as we must continue, to protect that environment for future generations. I come back to the point I made before: it is vital for the timber industry to have resource security. The government, quite frankly, has been lax on this issue and there has been very little happening in the federal sphere. The lack of resource security means that many mills will not invest in new machinery or take on new employees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I take this opportunity to thank honourable members who have participated in the debate on this package of bills. At one stage I thought the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) was going to name everyone in his electorate who works in the forest industry. I am sure there are many others who have not scored a guernsey tonight. I am sure, if they all receive a copy of his contribution, and my own, they will be very pleased at the support which he has given to the industry in his own electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I cannot agree with all the comments that have been made by honourable members opposite, there were a number of points that they made that were valid. In particular, I would like to thank the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne), and the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) for some very sensible contributions in the debate, in addition to the comments made by opposition members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the wide ranging nature of some of the contributions made tonight, this package of bills is about the establishment of a research and development corporation. I recently had the opportunity to open North Broken Hill's forest research and development centre in Ridgley in north-west Tasmania. That company had sufficient faith in the future of the industry to invest a further half million dollars, which will result in an extra eight scientists being employed to work towards the development, through the use of genetic selection techniques, of new species of eucalypts which are frost resistant and which will provide better fibre quality in the development of hardwood plantations in that part of Tasmania. We all know that the development of plantations is the long-term future of this industry. That is why a number of the contributions from both sides of the House went to the development of plantations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I was at the Ridgley research and development centre, I had the chance to announce publicly that I had given approval for North Broken Hill to export 170,000 tonnes of woodchips through a transfer from the port of Bell Bay to the port of Burnie, which will allow a $30 million investment in the electorate of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), whom I am pleased to see is in the chamber tonight. We believe that that investment will allow for better long-term security of employment, not only at the Hampshire mill but in the pulp and paper mills that will depend on that mill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to make a few comments on some of the other contributions made tonight. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Ms Gallus) was rather critical of the ESD process, claiming that it went nowhere. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) disprove her by quoting the result of some of the ESD workers&mdash;something that he approved of. It was the ESD working group on forests which was able to do the groundwork towards the development of the national forests policy statement. I think that both the honourable member for Gippsland and I would say to the honourable member for Hindmarsh that perhaps she has got this one wrong and that the ESD process was able to come up with a number of proposals that were of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) made a very passionate speech. Obviously, he feels very strongly about many of these issues. He would be aware that we outlined in our national forest policy statement a commitment to encourage the tax office to prepare a comprehensive public ruling on these issues. I intend to make sure that that is finalised by the end of this year so that that can seek to provide a level of certainty and consistency that has not been there in the past. I am sure that is something that has the support of members of both sides of the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) went on to make a number of comments about resource security legislation. The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) also mentioned this in his contribution, as did the shadow minister for resources and energy, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). The opposition simply cannot get away from the fact that, when resource security legislation was before the last parliament, on a number of occasions it voted against that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Murray might argue that, if it were given a second chance, the opposition might have voted differently, if certain other things took place. But there is no denying the fact that when the government put up the legislation, admittedly with a threshold of $100 million for investment, it was a proposal that the opposition was not prepared to vote for at the time, and that is something which it will have to live with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Murray challenged me to declare what the government's position was on resource security. I refer him to page 17 of the national forest policy statement, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For firm and specific value adding projects, meeting guidelines agreed by the Commonwealth and the states, the governments will provide either specific legislation or an intergovernmental project agreement where this is a necessary prerequisite for the project to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement which has been agreed to by the Commonwealth and all the mainland states. That is the government's position. I am sure that those opposite are not surprised or shocked to learn that is the government's position on resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lyne made a number of comments about the membership of the selection committee for the board of the R&amp;D corporation. He was concerned that small sawmiller members are represented in some way. I am not sure whether honourable members realise this, but at the end of the day I receive nominations from NAFI, as the nominated body as the spokesman for the industry. In the last day or so it has sent me nominations for membership of the selection committee. That committee then goes away and selects the membership of the board. I can understand that there might be some sawmillers in his electorate who are not members of NAFI or the affiliated organisations, but I am advised that, for example, in Victoria there are some small sawmillers who are members of the Victorian Association of Forest Industries, and that is affiliated to NAFI. Perhaps through their Victorian colleagues they could make sure that they do have some input into the NAFI process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of those rare occasions when people on both sides of the House support a measure which has great potential to help improve the prospects of an industry that offers this country a great deal. I am prepared to give this House my commitment that I, as Minister for Resources, intend to do all I can to reduce the $2.4 billion worth of forest product imports that this country currently purchases. If measures such as this can achieve half of the aims that members speaking in this debate tonight have outlined, then we can make a real contribution to lifting the levels of research and development that go into improving the productivity of this industry. I am sure that that, along with other measures that the government will bring forward, can succeed in reducing that $2.4 billion import bill. In that way, we can make a real contribution to encouraging investment and jobs growth not only in this industry but also in many others. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources (Mr Lee), when concluding the debate on the Forest Industries Research Levy Bill, indicated that in his view it was the opposition that destroyed any chance of comprehensive resource security legislation. That, in my view, is quite incorrect. I want to quote from a joint statement put out by the Hon. Fred Chaney, the former shadow minister for sustainable development and the environment, and me after the former Minister for Resources, now Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths), was not able to sustain a written agreement he had with us in relation to enlarging the application of resource security legislation beyond the $100 million threshold which was the basis of the government legislation and which precluded all of the timber industry from gaining any resource security.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement which was reached was as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.agree to retitle the Bill to Forest Conservation and Major Projects. All provisions of the Bill would remain unchanged;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.undertake to monitor and review the effectiveness of the legislation to ensure that it achieves its objectives of certainty and security for the industry and generates value adding investment and jobs in the forest industries. If it can be demonstrated that the legislation has not achieved its objectives within a reasonable time frame the Government would, in consultation with industry, consider what future action might be appropriate;</PARA>
<PARA>This next point is the critical one:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.agree to consult with industry and trade unions concerning the development of the concept of enhanced intergovernmental agreements designed to provide resource security on a regional basis for those forest industry investments which would not otherwise qualify under the Forest Conservation and Major Project legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, means those under $100 million. There were also several other points. When the minister reneged on that agreement we did vote against the legislation on the recommendation of the forest industry itself, that is the National Association of Forest Industries and the Forest Protection Society, that any legislation which did not give resource security for all of those investments under $100 million was of no value to the industry as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the industry that prior to the last-minute negotiations on which the minister could not finally deliver&mdash;and I say again that when the minister could not deliver the industry itself urged us to vote against&mdash;we had in consultation with the industry provided a number of amendments to the government's bill. When the government was not prepared to accept those amendments a Senate inquiry was held, and both industry and union witnesses&mdash;I emphasise this: union witnesses&mdash;agreed that the legislation would be improved by our amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government continued to refuse to accept those amendments, despite the support from the industry and the trade union movement. Then we finally took up in good faith&mdash;and I believe it was offered in good faith by the then minister&mdash;the opportunity to negotiate some agreements so we could get real resource security legislation through. After a series of meetings there was a written agreement between the two parties, Fred Chaney and me on the one hand and the minister on the other, and that is when this other process that I referred to intervened to make sure that the minister could not deliver and that no worthwhile legislation could pass. </PARA>

It is not adequate to get the investment going that is needed for this industry and for Australia, which I believe he personally would like to see and I know we would like to see. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take the opportunity of the adjournment debate to praise a community group in my electorate, the Low Isles Preservation Society, otherwise known as LIPS. Low Isles represents one large and several small coral cays off the coast near Port Douglas. They have been a tourist attraction for some time and the source of research on the Great Barrier Reef since the 1920s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years the Low Isles have been managed and protected by resident lighthouse keepers. Now that lighthouses are to be demanned, the Port Douglas community has formed LIPS to lobby for the preservation and future protection of the Low Isles for all the community. Anyone who has witnessed the natural beauty of Low Isles will attest to that need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Friday night I attended a public meeting at Port Douglas which celebrated the rebirth of Low Isles after the commitment of $1.5 million in the budget. This enabled the management of Low Isles to be passed to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. GBRMPA will provide at least one full-time resident ranger. Funding will also be used to improve existing buildings, sewerage and other facilities. Research, which as I said has gone on since the 1920s, will now be able to continue. LIPS involvement will continue with the community commitment to future maintenance of facilities on the Low Isles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Special praise should go to Karl Jesienowski, the President of LIPS, and the LIPS committee, as well as the Port Douglas Tourist Association, the Mossman Boat Club and, in particular, the support that has been given by the Mossman Gorge Aboriginal community to LIPS. I have nothing but praise for this community group. This group approached me and the state member for Cook, Mr Steve Bredhauer, some time ago. LIPS impressed me with its professional expertise and hard lobbying skills as well as the fact that it represented a broad range of the Port Douglas community. </PARA>

I am sure that its cooperative approach could well be a model for future management of other environmentally sensitive areas throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I wish to raise for the attention of the government and the House concerns the natural disaster relief arrangements for people affected by the very serious floods that devastated north-eastern Victoria earlier this month. Just briefly to remind honourable members, the position is that virtually thousands of people have been affected by these floods which are the worst in recorded European settlement history. We have a range of people who are affected such as families; pensioners living in houses that are rented or owned; small business people in shops, particularly in Benalla, and people in factories; and farmers whose lands have been totally denuded of topsoil and who have had their crops wiped out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, even though the waters have now gone, the dimension of the problem is such that we have a worse disaster than I think is really appreciated. When a misfortune such as a flood in a community is suffered which affects just a handful of people, whilst the impact on the people is substantial, the impact on the region is not as great. But when a vast number of people are affected, as has happened in Benalla for instance, we have a national and a state problem of greater dimension. I do not think the full measure of the problem has been realised yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had messages, especially from Benalla, that indicate that many small businesses may not survive and may be unable to keep staff on. Some families are under enormous pressure. People are unable to repair their homes. Some landlords are unable to afford to repair rented homes. Farmers just do not know where to turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the state-Commonwealth arrangements there is a set of guidelines for natural disaster assistance, and that is much appreciated by many people. But I have had reports, for example, that people who are entitled to cash grants of up to $700 per family to carry on following the disaster have been refused that assistance because they were too late to lodge their claims&mdash;too late because they were out helping in emergency relief, rescue and cleaning up for others. This is  typical of Australians: helping others, and knowing full well that they had to clean up themselves. Yet when they have lodged their claims, they have been told that their claims were ineligible because they were out of time. That lack of flexibility between the states and the Commonwealth needs to be investigated urgently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are offers of concessional loans at four per cent to small businesses, but they have to prove their viability. Whilst I do not have all the personal details of applicants, I understand that most loans will not be granted because, due to the devastation, those small businesses are not viable and are therefore ineligible. Those businesses would have been able to continue to trade and employ people if they had not lost their stock and their premises could be used. But now the premises are not as effective, stock has been lost and, in many cases, the businesses have no cash and are in a precarious position. Again, the guidelines need to be reviewed so that special assistance grants can be given in appropriate cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, a number of farmers who would survive may not be able to cope with additional loans even at concessional rates because of their existing debt structure and the long-term nature of recovery from devastation. It may take some years before the paddocks can be restored to productivity. Generally speaking, there is a very serious situation in north-eastern Victoria. I ask all the responsible Commonwealth government ministers&mdash;of which there are several&mdash;to immediately discuss with the appropriate state ministers a review of the guidelines with a view to producing appropriate measures. There are many people in this area of Australia who would be prepared to assist both the state and Commonwealth governments in assessing and dealing with those particular problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The residents of Geelong's southern suburbs of Belmont and Highton, as well as the surf coast and Bellarine Peninsula towns such as Torquay and Ocean Grove now find it difficult and time-consuming to obtain cash rebates for medical bills attracting a Medicare rebate. It is about time that the Health Insurance Commission ended its illogical policy of not allowing some of the most respected private health funds to offer full agency facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Medicare agency through the Geelong Medical and Hospital Benefits Association is needed in Belmont. Until March 1988, GMHBA was one of the four health funds authorised to pay Medicare claims on the spot and in cash. In a decision that owed more to centralised Canberra control than to commonsense, the then Hawke government suddenly decided that it could no longer allow private health funds to act as Medicare agents. Since that date, whilst GMHBA will take Medicare claim forms and send them into Geelong for processing in the form of a mail cheque payment, residents of these suburbs and towns are forced to travel into Geelong, where parking is difficult, if they want an instant cash refund from Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why Medicare ceased this agency arrangement was a suggestion that some duplicate payments were occurring as agents were unable to assess the claims against a patient's claims history. There were also suggestions that some agents were not as competent as they might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time for the Health Insurance Commission to again appoint selected health funds in regional Australia as agents for Medicare claims to provide a personal and efficient service. Mrs Norman Boyd of Belmont wanted to see a new Medicare office established in Belmont. By her own efforts she started a petition in December 1992 that had the support of 800 residents. Today there are 266 Medicare offices around Australia. Back in 1987, there were 264. Under the Medicare arrangements, the Health Insurance Commission does not have the funds to open new offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geelong and its nearby towns need a convenient Medicare agency in Belmont run by an established, respected health fund such as GMHBA. The government has had an entrenched philosophical opposition to allowing private health funds to act as agents for Medicare but, given the increasing cost of running Medicare, it is time to look sensibly at the agency as an option. On the other hand, Medicare has an ideal time to implement this opening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November and December 1994 respectively the combined Medicare and Medibank Private offices leases expire at Corio Village and Moorabool Street in Geelong respectively. This would be an ideal chance for Medicare to move to slightly smaller premises in Geelong and save some of the $75,000 annual rent bill. There would be some fit-out costs at smaller premises, but if a three-year lease with at least a three-year option was taken, this could lead to some savings to the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another reason why Medicare clients in Geelong's southern suburbs and hinterland deserve a better service is the small number of claims that are direct or bulk-billed in these suburbs compared to what occurs at Corio across the Barwon River. Going by where doctors or providers, as Medicare calls them, are located, in the June 1993 quarter nearly 76 per cent of Corio's claims were bulk-billed. Yet, for the 44,300 claims against Medicare for postcode 3216&mdash;Belmont, Highton and Grovedale&mdash;lodged in the months of April, May and June this year, only half, 50.8 per cent to be exact, were bulk-billed. A quarter of all these payments were made in cash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So residents of these three Geelong suburbs are having to make at least 44,000 trips a year to call into Medicare's Geelong or Corio Village offices. Some of these trips may be combined with other shopping in Geelong, but many are not and cause inconvenience and extra expense to south of the river residents. The Health Insurance Commission must once again give efficient, respected health funds like GMHBA the chance to serve southern Geelong residents with one-stop shopping for health payments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Saturday I attended the opening of a unique medical establishment, the Bundaberg Friendly Societies Hospital. I was privileged to be asked to give a keynote address before the extensions were opened by the Chairman of the Private Hospitals Association of Queensland, Mr Cahill. I say `unique' because the hospital represents a caring and unselfish contribution of nine friendly societies lodges. While acknowledging the need for modern medical care, the BAFS Medical Institute, as it is known&mdash;the administrative arm of those nine lodges&mdash;has retained the essence of the community in the project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the helter-skelter of so-called regionalism, the dismantling of community aspects of medical and paramedical service&mdash;no more telling example of which was the changeover from the QATB to the Queensland Ambulance Service&mdash;and the dehumanising of many public hospital practices, this friendly societies hospital stands out in stark contrast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $5.2 million expansion takes the hospital to a $10 million facility. It started out in 1946 as little more than a cottage hospital. It worked itself up to a fully-fledged private hospital with extensions in 1983 and is now equal to the best in country Queensland. Its bed capacity has increased from 36 to 55 beds, including an ultra modern six-bed maternity unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All rooms are ensuited and encompass the most modern technology. It has state of the art laminar flow theatres and a quality high dependency unit. I might add, its telephone and TV systems are the equal to, if not better than we experience here in Parliament House&mdash;and that is saying something. As a person who served for 15 years on a public hospital board, I was amazed at the vision of this hospital board led by chairman, Bob Philips; his deputy, Maureen Kimber; secretary, Peter Sawyer; and director of nursing, Kim Knoblauch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The medical institute, which runs three successful commercial premises and a highly successful pharmacy turning over $3 1/2 million a year, makes a significant contribution to the quality of medical care in the Bundaberg community. It not only allows three hospitals&mdash;itself, the Mater Misericordiae Hospital and the Bundaberg Base Hospital&mdash;to specialise in areas of expertise but also makes a significant contribution to the economy of Bundaberg by injecting $9 3/4 million each year into the cash flow of the community. It employs 85 people, 65 of whom work in the new hospital. To cap it off, the board of the BAFS Medical Institute delivers this service&mdash;it might be worth a lot of other private hospitals listening to this&mdash;at the scheduled fee. There are no loadings; the service is delivered at the scheduled fee. The institute even offers a rebate roughly equivalent to 10 per cent to its lodge members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have often heard in this House honourable members&mdash;especially those from New South Wales&mdash;complaining about the quality of health care, some blaming the ALP government and some blaming the previous coalition government. I do not know who is to blame, but I found this hospital&mdash;which stands in stark contrast to the handout mentality of many hospitals&mdash;to be a refreshing difference. I am not suggesting that health care is not the</PARA>
<PARA>ultimate responsibility of government. Clearly it is. However, I question whether we have paid a high price in taking the community aspect out of the health equation. With understandable pride, I congratulate the BAFS Medical Institute and its nine constituent lodges, and I trust that they will continue to deliver quality health care in the Bundaberg district. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Total deaths from AIDS related causes in Australia to 31 March 1993 are 2,630.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Exposure category is known for 2,610 of these deaths and, of these, 77 (3%) are attributable to infection from blood products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) It is not possible to supply this information with any certainty. While there are some items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule and some drugs listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which are likely to be applicable to particular conditions, the greater part of Commonwealth expenditure cannot be readily broken down by disease state. Funding under the Medicare agreements to the States for public hospitals is also not related to disease except in so far as there is a specific amount identified ($45.587m in 1992-93) in response to the burden of AIDS. It should be said that the aim of the Government is to ensure access to appropriate health care for all Australians irrespective of the condition from which they may be suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Mortality statistics do not include information on sexual preferences, nor are there any other measures of how many homosexual men there are in Australia. We therefore cannot estimate the chances of homosexual men dying from one cause or another. However, the majority of deaths from AIDS occur in men between the ages of 20 and 50 whereas deaths from cancer and heart disease occur in older age groups. Men dying from AIDS die earlier than they would from other leading causes of death in males.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the One Nation statement, the then Premier of Western Australia, Carmen Lawrence, and I agreed that $8 million from the package be held over, pending further consideration of infrastructure projects that would benefit the Western Australian community. When arriving at this agreement, we had in mind that the Hatt Report on the redevelopment of Subiaco Oval was then close to completion. While we were waiting for it to be released, it was necessary, for administrative convenience, that the $8 million be notionally allocated to some part of the One Nation package: it was notionally included in the National Highway System allocation for Western Australia but the funds were never allocated to specific projects and it was always envisaged that they would be devoted to Subiaco. In the 1992-93 and 1993-94 Budgets, the funds were presented as a separate appropriation titled Urban Infrastructure in the Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services portfolio.</PARA>
