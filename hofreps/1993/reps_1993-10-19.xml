<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In his outline of proposed legislation on native title on 2 September he said that a preamble to a bill would include the reassurance that, where there is or has been valid freehold or leasehold, native title does not exist. Is it not a fact that he has now resiled from this position? Will he now confirm that the effect of his latest Mabo proposal is that every valid pre-1975 pastoral lease in Australia, no matter how old, will be open to potential challenge in the courts by any native title claimant believing his or her rights still coexist with the rights of existing land-holders?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Aboriginal people have been prepared to give up a slender right in the common law on the basis of invalid leases, why would they bother taking their chances on valid leases? Why would they take their chances on valid leases when the general law is the way it is? In the preamble to the bill&mdash;the preamble is not part of the act&mdash;the purpose of the assurance would be to state what we believe the general law ought to be but would not change the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicated yesterday where we stood on those matters. But in speaking to and negotiating with Aboriginal people overnight, they took the view that the balance of Aboriginal and Islander community interests was that, rather than pursuing a slender and uncertain group of rights that might exist in some sets of native rights which were consistent with a pastoral lease and take their chances in the common law, they would have much preferred to have taken that which the government proposed. That was an opportunity for Aboriginal people to turn pastoral leases on which they hold the title into the equivalent of native title under this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So instead of chasing the slender opportunities that might have existed for anything above the reservations which the government will have in the bill anyway&mdash;that is, expressed reservations in the leases or reservations which come by virtue of customary usage&mdash;anything above that, in their view, was not equal to the benefit that might be conferred on Aboriginal people by being able to turn a pastoral lease they have title to into the equivalent of a form of native title; that is, for the leases they hold now, which are many, and for the ones they might acquire in the future. So this was a judgment they made in their own interests. We consulted with a representative group of them, being the same group we dealt with a week ago, and that was the position that they took.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Barker, who asked me the question, said on radio today that we are validating only pastoral leases. That is untrue. We are validating all the categories of leases mentioned in my press statement. He said that there is no procedure for the future&mdash;which is grossly untrue, totally untrue&mdash;and he is repeating it on radio stations around the country. There is a Federal Court stream to hear native title matters, there are state supreme court streams to hear native title matters, and then there are the economic land use tribunals of the states which will make adjudications about economic use and grants of interest in land under native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went on to say that the Commonwealth would be able to override a state decision. That is untrue. There is a Commonwealth and state ministerial override, and that will be for a state interest question. So a Commonwealth minister will not be overriding a particular investment proposal on behalf of a state. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aborigines shouldn't be allowed to have inalienable freehold because it isn't economically useful.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a bit of condescension, if we have ever heard any. Not that they are getting any under this bill; they are not. That is the contribution that the honourable member for Barker is making on radio around the country. It is about time the federal opposition came to the party and recognised that there is now a lot of commitment to the principles of native title. The spoiling game&mdash;attacking from the sidelines and sniping on the radio programs&mdash;of those opposite is not helping anyone, least of all themselves.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is also directed to the Prime Minister. In light of cabinet's decision last night in response to the High Court's Mabo judgment, can the Prime Minister tell the House how the Commonwealth will deliver justice to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people? Can he also say what longer term implications this historic decision might hold for the Australian people and Australian society?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2088" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is in the decisions made by the government last night&mdash;again in consultation with the Aboriginal community, the pastoral interests in this country via the National Farmers Federation, and also with the states&mdash;a series of proposals, that is, a bill which meets the substance and spirit of the High Court's historic judgment. The High Court came to the judgment&mdash;a correct judgment in legal and social terms&mdash;and it was for the Commonwealth parliament to put flesh on the bones to build a body of administrative law around that decision for the dispensing and protection of native title. I believe that that is what the government's package will do. It will meet the twin objectives of justice for Aboriginal people: let them repossess land they were long ago dispossessed of by way of native title; and, at the same time, make certain that the principles of economic management and land use remain workable so that the great land based industries of this country can grow as they have in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier today that this represents a new deal for Aboriginal Australians and a new deal between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. By legislating away the fiction of terra nullius, the land of no-one, and legislating in a basis for native title, Australia will in the future find its relationships based on a fundamental truth that this was never the land of no-one instead of persisting with a law based on a fundamental lie. The recognition of these things provides the sort of basis for a reconciliation on which past hopes and expectations might have foundered. The dispossession of Australian Aboriginal and Islander people meant that they were unable to enjoy and access lands with which they had long had a traditional association. Only by re-establishing that capacity can we hope to meet the underlying issue of reconciliation for dispossession, and that, of course, is land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would nevertheless like to put on the record my appreciation for the leadership shown by the leaders of the Aboriginal community who face a lot of personal pressure in arriving at a decision to negotiate with the government and to compromise on issues where they thought the principles that they must adhere to should be adhered to, but those which they believe the government was correct in following for land management should be basically ceded to the government. The end result is a bill which is effective and principled and which reflects credit on those who have been involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states have worked overtime, particularly at bureaucratic level, on this to see that the principles of land management from their perspective were kept intact. While the bill might not be everything they wish, it goes a very great distance to maintaining the states' imperatives in land management. I think that is reflected in comments today in a press statement by Premier Goss and remarks made to me earlier by Premier Kennett.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing generally broad acceptance of the principles, where the states' principles are there for managing land and through the instruments that they have in state land management. For industry, we are finding the validation up front over invalid grants being accepted and the fact that there is not, as it feared there might be, a general veto right available to Aboriginal people over all development proposals. That is not there either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is, above everything else, a native title bill. It is about Aboriginal and Islander people, about their land and their opportunities. It is about them, and the bill reflects that. The preponderance of its interest is about looking after their interest in the recognition and protection of native title, the establishment of fair and accessible procedures for the determination of claims to native title, the designation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to assist and represent native title claimants, the provision of a special right of negotiation in relation to grants proposed to be made over native title land, a right to seek replacement land as compensation for extinguishment, provisions for a substantial land acquisition initiative for those who could not avail themselves of the benefits of the Mabo decision and the subsequent legislation, and provision of a right to negotiate where land is to be compulsorily acquired in order for a grant to be made to a third party.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things are all core interests to the Aboriginal community. I am very pleased to say that the cabinet and the caucus supported today all of those principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me complete the answer by just paying a tribute to my ministerial colleagues on the native title committee, who have now spent over six months of most days of most weeks combing through the detail. There could be no piece of social legislation probably anywhere in a comparable country that would have received so much ministerial time, where the long principles have been considered, argued over and discussed, and where the detail has been painstakingly assembled to produce what I think is going to be an historic piece of legislation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If only we had real reason to rejoice. My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In the light of his answers, does he now expect that all outstanding native title claims in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and elsewhere will be withdrawn on the grounds explained by Mr Rick Farley this morning? Mr Farley said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth now has given a very clear undertaking and view to the courts that in the Commonwealth's view, the grant of a pastoral lease extinguishes native title.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should only imagine, given that there has been broad agreement by the Aboriginal community&mdash;and I mean very broad agreement&mdash;to effect a positive outcome in this legislation, that, having secured it, the most vulnerable land to a native title claim will be that where traditional associations can be most easily and first established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem, therefore, that vexatious ambit claims that do not have a chance of succeeding do not amount to much point when there will be a facility for real claims based on clear, traditional and cultural association to succeed, probably when the institutions are set up with some rapidity. Therefore, I should imagine that many Aboriginal people who have been particularly supportive of this legislation would regard that as the way to go rather than broad land claims that might have been lodged either with some political effect intended, lodged emotionally, lodged in protest or lodged in any other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the fact is if the government is making the law available, they should avail themselves under the law. But, again, because the government has dealt with the Aboriginal community in writing the Mabo bill, no representative of the Aboriginal community can say of all Aboriginal people that, no, their rights before the courts are in some way constrained; any more than any one of us could say, upon the passage of legislation here, that we would be constraining non-Aboriginal Australians from their recourse to the law.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6T4">Mr ELLIOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Finance representing the Treasurer. In his budget speech, the Treasurer established a deficit reduction strategy involving reductions in outlays and revenue increases designed to cut the deficit by $9 billion in 1996-97. I ask: is the government still committed to this medium term deficit reduction strategy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2089" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the honourable member for Parramatta and the House that the government is committed to its deficit reduction program, despite the difficulties we are experiencing in fully implementing that program at this stage. It is important that the government is so committed because of the importance of the deficit reduction program to maintaining business and investor confidence in Australia and indeed the scope for economic recovery. The importance of that has been neatly summed up by the International Monetary Fund in its recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Economic Outlook</EMPHASIS>, in which it said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is encouraging that governments everywhere acknowledge that the re-emergence or persistence of large budget deficits needs to be addressed as a matter of considerable urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A failure to reduce substantially these imbalances over the medium term would likely cause renewed upward pressure on long term interest rates, reduce capital formation and the scope for new job creation in the private sector, lower the rate of growth of potential output and income, and continue to impede the flexibility of fiscal policy in the event of adverse cyclical developments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, growing doubts about the sustainability of budgetary implications could eventually lead to a rise in inflationary expectations and to instability in financial and foreign exchange markets.</PARA>
<PARA>That clearly sums up very neatly the importance of the deficit reduction program and the importance to this nation that the government's program be implemented. It is a great pity that the government's dedication to reducing the deficit is not shared by the opposition which, by its actions, I remind the House, is attempting to increase the budget deficit in every year and in 1996-97 to increase it by some $3 billion. But, incredibly, the opposition is still claiming that it is in favour of reducing the deficit. Last week on 13 October, in talking to a Queensland Liberal Party luncheon, the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I personally am committed to a deficit reduction strategy but I don't believe they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are.</PARA>
<PARA>So this is absolutely <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alice in Wonderland</EMPHASIS> stuff. Here is the opposition doing its darnedest to increase the deficit year by year by blocking these various tax measures, while at the same time claiming that it is in favour of reducing the deficit and that the government is not, when the government is doing its best to get the deficit down by trying to get these measures through. It is a complete reversal of reality which demonstrates how off the beam the opposition really is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even when the opposition is faced with industry support for tax measures, it will not support them. The obvious case here is the wine industry, which has agreed to a package of measures which my colleague the Treasurer negotiated with the industry last week and which considerably reduces the proposed increase in sales tax on wine and provides some other benefits for the industry. The chief negotiator for the industry, Mr Brian Croser, the President of the Winemakers Federation, said of that package that it was a totally satisfactory outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But still the opposition opposed it, saying that there was still a lot of opposition to it in the wine industry. Today the wine industry has made another statement on the issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Meeting of The Winegrape Growers Council of Australia (WGCA) and The Winemaker's Federation of Australia (WFA) held in Canberra October 18th, 1993 has resolved:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"To expedite the return to business of the Australian Wine Industry by the passage of the taxation package agreed between on the one hand the Winemakers' Federation of Australia and the Winegrape Growers Council of Australia and on the other hand the Federal Government. All segments of the industry including The South Australian Farmers Federation Winegrapes Section, urge the Greens senators to support the package, unaltered.</PARA>
<PARA>That is signed by Mr Brian Croser from the Winemakers Federation of Australia; Mr Ludas from the Winegrapes Section of the South Australian Farmers Federation; Mr Smith, President of the Wine Industry Association of Western Australia; Mr Dal Broi from the Winegrape Growers Council of Australia; Mr Riggs, President of the Australian Winemakers Forum; and Mr Shelmerdine, President of the Victorian Wine Industry Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, every significant organised section of the wine industry in Australia has called on the Greens to support this measure, and we certainly hope that they will. Significantly, the wine industry has not said anything about the opposition. The industry has not called on the opposition to support it because basically the opposition is a dead letter. The industry knows that the opposition is not concerned about it. There is no point in appealing to the opposition for a reasonable response&mdash;a response which would be in the interests of an industry which is currently losing, according to Mr Croser, some $2.3 million a day because of the uncertainty which has been created by the actions of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst this is going on, those opposite, who represent the wine growing areas of Australia in the main, are refusing to support their constituents' interests. We have the two South Australian members, the honourable member for Mayo and the honourable member for Barker, both trying their best to stop this measure getting through when the South Australian wine growers organisation is saying, `Pass this measure; it's in the interests of the industry'. This shows that the opposition is totally bloody minded; it is only interested in playing politics. It has not even got the interests of an industry that it says it is so concerned about&mdash;the wine industry&mdash;at heart at all. It is concerned simply to try to make this government's life as difficult as possible and it will do that to the point where it is even prepared to hurt its own constituents.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I rise to speak on a point of order. We are treating this matter with the seriousness that it deserves. The Prime Minister was asked a very specific question: how was it envisaged by the government that the states might legislate to extinguish the interests of holders of native titles without the possibility of breaching the Racial Discrimination Act?

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I addressed this question in detail yesterday. I will address the question again. This comes from an opposition whose sole policy has been to validate past titles. The sole utterance that the opposition has made of any coherence on Mabo has been that of no prospective policy on Mabo&mdash;only retrospective on past titles. So now that the past titles are being validated, apparently the question is: how is the government doing it? The opposition has been advocating the policy for months and months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made it very clear yesterday that the government's legislation will emanate from one of the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act; that is, the legislation will not override the Racial Discrimination Act, it will arise from the Racial Discrimination Act. That is the point that I made yesterday. That is where its authority is coming from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At any rate, there is quite a body of legal opinion and disagreed views about the fact that, even were a past procedure to be regarded as unfair by some people because of the fact that procedural fairness could not have been guaranteed while a land manager had never known that a native title existed, many believe the payment of compensation alone is enough to allow the validation of the leases, let alone dealing with the question of procedural fairness. So that is the key point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me just quote some words from the Victorian premier. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria supports the general thrust of the proposal, but there are some areas such as compensation which need clarification. Premier Kennett today called on all parties and interest groups to use the Prime Minister's Mabo proposal as a base for resolving the Mabo impasse.</PARA>
<PARA>Why cannot the federal opposition rise to the occasion? Why is it now the odd group out in Australian society&mdash;not the states, not the pastoralists, not the NFF and not industry? The odd group out is the federal opposition. Its one question now&mdash;on the one policy that it has been urging for months and months, the validation of title&mdash;is to call into question whether validation can actually be accomplished without suspending the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to inform the House that we are now seeing consistent signs of a pick-up in economic expansion. A most recent survey by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures shows significant improvement in the  September quarter. Manufacturing production and sales rose for the fifth consecutive quarter. The improved performance, I am happy to say, was also very broadly based. It occurred in all states and nearly all sectors of manufacturing&mdash;indeed in eight of the 10 sectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Export performance has also improved. These improvements are reflected in employment. For the first time in the recovery, firms hiring additional labour exceeded those shedding labour. The ACM survey points to further improvement in the December quarter, with a further pick-up in expected production and sales, investment, and in expected employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are signs of continuing improvement in other sectors of the economy too. The housing sector is showing continuing strength with a further trend increase in finance approvals for new dwellings in August. The job market is showing consistent improvement. Employment rose by 45,100, seasonally adjusted, in September. The ANZ job ads series rose solidly over recent months. On the growth front, we have seen recent signs that there is a build-up in the pick-up in growth that we saw in the June quarter. In the June quarter the annual GDP growth accelerated to 3.3 per cent, the seventh consecutive quarter of growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also noteworthy that the world economy seems to be picking up as well. We will probably see some further strengthening of our own economic recovery as a consequence. The US recovery has consolidated in recent months, underpinned by steady growth in consumer spending, investment and employment growth. The Japanese economy should pick up in early 1994 in response to a recent cut in interest rates and another stimulatory package to be announced later this year. Growth in east Asia, excluding Japan, has picked up and is expected to average just over six per cent in 1993, and to be even stronger in 1994, compared with less than 5 1/2 per cent in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think the message is that expansion is gathering pace, both at home and abroad&mdash;in the Australian economy, particularly in the Asia-Pacific economy, and in important OECD economies such as the United States. Of course, we hope that this bodes well for further growth in employment. I have said before, and I will say again, that one of the objectives of this government will be to look after the long-term unemployed in this process. As we get some growth and churning in the economy we are seeing for the first time additional labour hirings exceeding labour sheddings in business. We will be hoping that this stronger expansion will deal in part with the problem of the long-term unemployed, and that the government's application of labour market programs to that problem will materially help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, you know, and the House knows, that the government has a task force looking at employment policy which will report to the government in November. One of its priorities is the long-term unemployed. In 1994, with the implementation of a package arising from the receipt and consideration of that task force report, and in the context of a growing economy, the prospects are that employment will recover in aggregate and there will be better prospects for the long-term unemployed in particular. So, Mr Speaker, in all, we have a strengthening of economic expansion, a wider recovery, broadly based in all states and in nearly all sectors with exports improving as well, and that is being backed up by the ACM surveys which point to further improvement in the December quarter, which is particularly encouraging news indeed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a strong body of opinion that a valid lease extinguishes native title absolutely. But, strong body of opinion or not, this legislation is not about&mdash;and never has been about&mdash;valid titles; it has been about invalid titles. It has been about interests over land which has been issued, maybe in contravention of the Racial Discrimination Act, and where validity was a question. The simple point we are making is that, after having made an agreement with the Aboriginal community, we will now be extinguishing any native title on pastoral leases because the Aborigines see that the benefits and balance of advantage are in the proposals outlined by the government to them last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason why I think the Aboriginal community understandably said, `Yes, on the balance of probability, it is of benefit to us. Let us have an extinguishment here'. But the bill is about the awarding of native title in the future and the validation of those grants which may have been potentially invalid under the Racial Discrimination Act or the interaction of other acts. It has never been about dealing with valid title for the very reason that valid title is just that&mdash;valid title.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Fraser for his question. He certainly draws attention to a very important trend in relation to the Australian population. Over the last 20 years we have seen a doubling of the over 65 population. In the next 30 years we will see a further doubling occur again. We are specifically seeing now quite a sharp increase in the older old population, or the over 80s group. That age group is growing very rapidly. Between 1981 and 1991 this group increased by 52 per cent. Over the next decade it will grow by another 48 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently Australia spends about 2.5 per cent of GDP in terms of total health and care services for the aged. As this process of aging increases more rapidly, then we expect to spend considerably more than that&mdash;perhaps more than double that 2.5 per cent of GDP. The government has recognised this changing demography, particularly over the last decade, and it has responded by restructuring retirement income policy and by reforming the provision of aged care. An ever increasing proportion of the aged population is able to support itself independent of the pension, and this will be very true in the future, through superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This theme is addressed in a report I released yesterday by ANU economics professor Bob Gregory on reforms in terms of our aged care strategy. Professor Gregory has anticipated the pressure that will grow on the financing of long-term care, particularly as the older population increases in the early part of the next century. Professor Gregory has looked at a series of options, including private long-term care insurance and a universal social insurance scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Gregory's report is sceptical of private long-term insurance and the extent to which those requiring high levels of care would be those most at risk. He found a universal system of social insurance might provide a more equitable system of coverage and benefits that could not be achieved by private insurance. He recommended that the government consider a component of superannuation contributions to finance aged care. This approach suggested by Professor Gregory will be developed further by him. The government will be very much guided by equity considerations in its response to the Gregory report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson, who is the opposition spokesperson on aged care, was not at all inhibited by questions of equity in her response to the Gregory report yesterday. She indicated very clearly that she favoured a private insurance approach. At the most recent election, with coalition policies still intact, those opposite took the view that it made sense in terms of health to rip something like a billion dollars out of the public sector, to emasculate Medicare and seek to substitute for a very well-established system one based on private health insurance. In the area of aged care, where we need to be looking at the longer term, Senator Patterson seems to be flagging a similar approach.</PARA>

<PARA>The Housing Assistance Amendment Bill 1993 amends subsection 7(3A) of the Housing Assistance Act 1989. Under this act the states are provided with financial assistance by the Commonwealth to deliver housing assistance for rental housing and home purchase in accordance with the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. That agreement, commonly referred to as the CSHA, is schedule 1 to the act. In amending subsection 7(3A) of this act, the bill sets out revised appropriations made under the act for the years 1993 to 1996. The amendment encompassed in this bill gives effect to a number of government decisions announced in the 1993-94 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revisions arise from a rephasing of $25 million originally brought forward to 1993-94 from out-years for the purposes of employment generation and of $10 million for the community housing program which was originally to be available for payment in 1993-94. In addition, there has been a small one-off adjustment to new 1993-94 funds for the crisis accommodation program. Ensuring that Australians have access to affordable and appropriate housing remains a key priority for the federal government in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment proposed in this bill is consistent with the government's housing priorities. It continues the government's commitment to providing long-term financial assistance for the provision of public housing, funding for the provision of the new community housing program&mdash;CHP&mdash;and continuing support for the crisis accommodation program. In addition to the $1,042.39 million to be appropriated in 1993-94 under the terms of the bill, the 1989 act also allows for unpaid Commonwealth funds to be carried forward from 1992-93. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe) has determined that a total of $82.3 million will be carried forward under this provision, resulting in total Commonwealth funds available under the CSHA of $1,125 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of its 1992-1993 budget initiatives, the government announced that $100 million of CSHA funds earmarked for expenditure in later years would be available for expenditure on employment generation projects in 1992-93 and 1993-94. These funds were to be made available for allocation to states which were able to demonstrate an ability to accelerate housing activity, particularly in areas of high unemployment. In 1992-93, $75 million in funds brought forward from later years was allocated to the states on this basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that bringing forward these funds in 1992-93 was an important and successful initiative. It provided a significant boost to expenditure on construction and capital upgrading projects which were able to be implemented quickly. In addition, the projects funded in various states created additional employment while furthering the government's strategic housing objectives in terms of social justice and urban consolidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of this success, the government had no hesitation in approving the carryover from 1992-93 of unpaid Commonwealth funds, totalling $22.3 million, to be available for payment to relevant states for employment generation purposes in 1993-94. However, circumstances have changed since the decision was made to bring forward to 1993-94 a further $25 million in Commonwealth funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992-93, housing sector activity was 15 per cent higher than it was in 1991-92. In addition, dwelling commencements in 1993-94 are expected to total about 157,000, an amount of similar magnitude to that attained in 1992-93. However, housing activity is presently predicted to be lower in 1994-95 than in 1991-92. The underlying level of demand has been forecast by the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry as averaging 117,000 over the next five years. This is the product of a fall in demand due to a drop in immigration to Australia and the satisfaction of pent-up demand over the last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The carryover of $82.3 million from 1992-93 into 1993-94 is also underpinning substantial capital and upgrading projects, which are currently planned or under way. It is estimated that this carryover is supporting around 900 extra jobs in the construction industry. This employment boost is having flow-on effects to other economic sectors as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the need to allocate $25 million of funds, previously brought forward for expenditure in 1993-94, is not as pressing as it was when the decision was made more than a year ago. For this reason, the government has decided to rephase that $25 million so that an additional $12.5 million in CSHA funding will be available in untied funds in both 1994-95 and 1995-96. The $25 million intended for expenditure in 1993-94 is thus being fully restored over the following two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new community housing program has been designed to achieve an expansion of this sector and the government has secured the enthusiastic support of non-government agencies to meet this challenge. However, federal government funding for the CHP over the next three years has been revised to reflect likely expenditure patterns. Ten million dollars, originally earmarked for expenditure on the CHP in 1993-94, has been rephased so that an additional $5 million will be available for expenditure on this program in both 1994-95 and 1995-96. Funding of $60.8 million, including $18.8 million in unpaid Commonwealth funds carried forward from 1992-93, will be available for payment under the CHP in 1993-94, with $62 million in new funds allocated in 1994-95 and $69 million in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also committed to the continuing provision of assistance to people in housing crisis. Total Commonwealth funds available for expenditure on the crisis accommodation program, or CAP, in 1993-94 amount to $73.6 million, comprising $36.2 million in new funds, $7.1 million in unpaid Commonwealth funds carried over from 1992-93, and an additional $30.3 million in unspent CAP funds already held by the states. The total amount available in 1993-94 is some $20 million more than was spent in 1992-93. Compared with this level of funds, the proposed cut to CAP funds of $3.5 million is modest&mdash;a reduction of less than five per cent of total funds for 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to apply a small cut in CAP funding in 1993-94 was taken in the light of a pattern of significant underexpenditure in the program. At 30 June 1993, over $37 million in previous years' allocations remained unspent. Program underexpenditure has been partly attributable to an inability to plan projects on the basis of funds becoming available in subsequent years. This constraint has been removed, with states now able to anticipate Commonwealth funding for up to three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has also included CAP in the new cash management arrangements for the CSHA which were introduced in 1992-93. Under these arrangements, Commonwealth funds will be advanced to states only as required. Payments are made no more than a month in advance of estimated expenditure. Together with the ability to better plan outlays as a result of the forward commitment capability, this is expected to provide a significant incentive to improve program performance and reduce unspent funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the capital funding arm of the supported accommodation assistance program, or SAAP, CAP featured in the recent national evaluation of SAAP. The evaluation concluded that SAAP has fulfilled an essential role in funding the crisis and transitional accommodation needed by homeless people&mdash;113 dwellings with 480 beds were approved in 1992-93. However, there is some criticism of the relative inflexibility with which funds have been applied: there has been an overemphasis on the design and construction of dwellings rather than purchase, and insufficient attention to leasing options. These matters will be addressed in the development of strategic directions for SAAP commissioned by social welfare ministers, and in the CAP review commissioned by housing ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the bill provides for variations in expenditure made available for various programs funded under the CSHA for the years 1993 to 1996, and its provisions reflect the level of housing activity which is expected to be achieved during this period. The bill is also consistent with improved cash management arrangements for the CSHA which have been negotiated successfully with the states by the Commonwealth government. These arrangements provide for improved accountability for Commonwealth funds which are provided to the states under the CSHA. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It really has been tragic in the last two months for the wine industry in this country following the 17 August budget. In that budget honourable members will recall the government announced that it wished to increase the tax on the wine industry by some 55 per cent. Ever since that time the tax&mdash;which has of course been in force since 17 August&mdash;and the uncertainty surrounding the whole issue have led to a disastrous slump in sales for the wine industry. The important point for me to make here, and for people to understand, is that it is the government, through its own single-minded vindictiveness, which has created this chaos and such pain in the industry. During a period when wine sales are normally very buoyant, they have been exceptionally flat because of the pain the government decided in a vindictive act to impose on that industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry has had a very unhappy experience with the Labor Party ever since Labor was elected federally in 1983. Not many honourable members would remember, but at the time of the 1983 election the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) was the shadow minister for primary industry. During that election one of the marginal seats was the seat of Kingston, which the Labor Party eventually won. Within the seat of Kingston was the area of McLaren Vale and Willunga, the southern vales of South Australia, one of Australia's best known winegrowing areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Werriwa went to McLaren Vale during that election campaign and promised the people of Kingston and of the southern vales that, under Labor, there would be no wine tax. A year later, in its 1984 budget, the Labor government imposed a 10 per cent wine tax. For two years there were repeated assurances that there would be no increase in the wine tax, but in the budget of 1986 the government doubled the wine tax from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. The tax remained at 20 per cent until 17 August this year when, without any forewarning at all, the industry was once more hit with a massive increase in the wine tax from 20 per cent to 31 per cent, moving on to 32 per cent. There was no promise&mdash;it was not referred to&mdash;during the election campaign that there would be a sudden increase in the wine tax. The Labor Party did not have the courage or the decency to tell the people about that. Instead, just out of the blue, it imposed a massive increase in tax on an industry which has been performing well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple message from the government is that, if an industry is performing well in this country and achieves things in the way that the wine industry has, it will be taxed, and taxed at a higher and higher rate. The whole philosophy of the Labor Party is revealed, I think, through this tax measure: first, make sure that you do not tell the public what you are going to do; secondly, make sure you go through an election campaign, playing a game of deceit. When that is finished, go out and slug anybody who is making good in this country, and get the revenue for your tax and spend policies. That is exactly what has happened to the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the figures we can see how extraordinarily successful that industry has been in export markets in recent years. In 1990-91, the industry exported $179.6 million worth of wine&mdash;54,000 litres. By 1992-93, a couple of years later, it was exporting $292.5 million worth of wine&mdash;102 million litres. In other words, the wine industry has approximately doubled its exports over the last two or three years. What is the sense, when an industry is doing so well&mdash;creating jobs, earning export income and helping to develop regional Australia&mdash;in imposing a massive new tax on that industry? Only a vindictive and bitter mind would want to do that to an industry that was succeeding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the government's arguments is that the wine industry should pay the same amount of tax&mdash;or excise, as it is in the case of the beer industry&mdash;as the beer industry; that there should be a level playing field between wine and beer. But it has never occurred to members of the Labor Party that to achieve a greater degree of equality in taxation&mdash;not a principle they were prepared to support at the last election; on the contrary it was a principle they campaigned against&mdash;the tax on the item taxed at a higher rate should be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It never occurred to members of the tax and spend Labor Party that they could go down that path. That is way beyond the intellect of the average social democrat Labor member of parliament. They are interested only in taxing and spending. That is their only answer to economic policy. Where an industry, such as the wine industry, is doing well they whack on a higher tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard the way the industry has been treated by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as little short of vindictive. When the industry announced that it would be badly damaged by this tax, that matter was of no concern to the government. Let us not forget that, if the coalition had not opposed the increases in tax on the wine industry, the Labor Party would have been very happy to go ahead with its 55 per cent slug. It would have wiped out a lot of the smaller wineries, destroyed the livelihoods of many of the growers, and cut the heart out of an important export industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We decided we would oppose this tax increase. On this occasion&mdash;I am glad to say&mdash;in one way or another, we were supported by the minor parties in the Senate. But if we had not decided to oppose this measure it would simply have sailed through the parliament and the industry would have been crippled by a 55 per cent tax increase. Any concessions that have been made, whether or not we approve of them, are thanks to the efforts by the coalition. They would never have occurred had we not decided to oppose the original tax increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether the wine industry should agree to this deal will be debated for many years to come. Those people who were actively involved in the politics of the industry felt very threatened by the blackmailing tactics of the Labor Party and, in particular, of the Treasurer. When the Treasurer became aware that some sections of the industry may have been willing to negotiate, he announced at the dispatch box on the other side of the chamber that he would slap an excise on this industry if it did not agree to an increase in the sales tax on wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer knows that he can impose an excise for up to 12 months before it is eventually rejected by the parliament&mdash;which, of course, it would be. The Treasurer was saying to the wine industry, `If you do not agree to paying higher taxes, I will wreck the industry'. I have to say that I think it was an empty threat. I do not think that any Treasurer of this country, no matter how vindictive and bitter that person may be, would wreck a whole industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe for a minute that the excise will ever be introduced&mdash;at least not for the next few years. But the fact is that many people in the industry were intimidated by this and felt that it was necessary to do some sort of deal. The deal still increases tax on the wine industry; it still punishes the industry; it still damages the industry; it still puts the industry at a disadvantage; it will still cost jobs; it will damage the interests of the growers; it will still harm many of the wineries; and it will reduce the capacity of the industry to compete internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people in the Labor Party seriously think that this measure has anything to do with their so-called deficit reduction strategy&mdash;which, by the way, is just a political stunt for this year; next year it will have forgotten about that&mdash;it has nothing to do with that. The Labor Party has blown out the budget deficit to the highest level on record in the history of this country&mdash;a deficit of $16 billion&mdash;and instead of progressively reducing spending it is increasing spending and increasing taxes to finance it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the amount of money that the government gets out of the wine industry&mdash;particularly in light of this so-called deal or these concessions&mdash;will be infinitesimal as a proportion of Commonwealth revenues this year and in subsequent years. After all, when the government wanted to put up the tax by 55 per cent, the maximum it anticipated getting was something like $70 million this year&mdash;$70 million out of $100 billion or approximately 0.07 per cent of revenue. As I said, it is an infinitesimal proportion and has nothing to do with deficit reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble with the plan is that it will continue the uncertainty around the industry for the rest of the term of this government. Consumers will know that every year that goes by the tax is going to go up another notch. This year, if this measure passes, it will go down from 31 per cent to 22 per cent, but next year it will go up to 24 per cent, and the following year it will go up to 26 per cent. At the end of the financial year, in May or June, consumers will know that the tax is going up by two more percentage points at the beginning of the new financial year. So why would they buy wine during that two-month period? We will see a slump in sales towards the end of every single financial year. In other words, there will be that continuing uncertainty and instability in the industry culminating, after the increase in the tax to 26 per cent, in the uncertainty about what is going to happen next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know what the Labor Party wants to do: it wants to increase the tax to the highest rate of sales tax which is applicable to things like jewellery. The Labor Party wants to apply the same rate of tax to jewellery and to the wine industry as though the wine industry had the same moral basis as jewellery in our society. That is a quite extraordinary proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During and before the last election campaign Labor ministers and the Prime Minister were claiming that the 30 per cent sales tax rate&mdash;it has gone up since then&mdash;was the luxury rate; that was the rate we whacked on luxury goods. The government wants to increase the tax on wine to the luxury rate. In other words, despite the fact that wine is one of our really successful industries, the Labor Party wants to get it because it has decided that the industry is a luxury industry. It is an utterly absurd proposition, but that is what the Labor Party thinks. We know that the Labor Party's plan will always be to increase the tax to what will eventually be 32 per cent. There will be an Industry Commission report into whether that should or should not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one in Australia knows at this stage what the Industry Commission report is likely to say, but we can assume that it is likely to be less than enthusiastic about keeping the tax at a lower, rather than higher, level. We can assume that for a range of different reasons, which I will not go into now. It is highly likely that the Industry Commission will come out in support of a higher tax on the wine industry on the grounds that wine should be taxed at a comparable level to beer&mdash;never considering the argument that it might be better off reducing the tax on beer. It is as if the only argument that mattered were for an equitable level of tax between those two types of beverages, leaving aside all other types of beverages which are substitutable for wine and/or beer. So there is uncertainty about the Industry Commission report, and there is the uncertainty of progressively increasing taxes on this industry. The only offsets&mdash;and there are some offsets&mdash;are some cash handouts which will last for a few years and some depreciation concessions which may last for a few years, but there is no commitment from the government to keep those indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the people that the Labor Party remembers only during election campaigns and forgets when elections are not in the air&mdash;that is the consumers, the ordinary people of Australia&mdash;will end up paying more for their wine as a result of this measure. That, of course, affects the living standards of Australians. The government did not promise, or even let on, at the time of the last election that it would make  everybody in this country pay more for wine, which is becoming a very important form of consumption in Australia. The government did not tell anybody that; it just did it after the election. I think that is utterly despicable, because the government obviously knew at the time of the election, which was only five months before the budget, that it would pursue this vindictive and vicious measure against the wine industry. If this legislation gets through the parliament, it will get through only because of the heavy-handed blackmail tactics used by the Labor Party in order to achieve what is always its objective, and that is to impose higher taxes on industries and on individuals. That is its record; that is the ambition of its budget; that is the way it claims that over the next few years it will achieve a reduction in the massive budget deficit that it has blown out. We will expect in future budgets, except for the budget leading up to the next election, further increases in tax until this matter of taxation in the wine industry is finally settled. It cannot be settled under a Labor government, because we know that Labor always wants to increase tax on the wine industry and so there will be continuing uncertainty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Sales Tax (Customs) (Wine&mdash;Deficit Reduction) Bill, the Sales Tax (Excise) (Wine&mdash;Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Sales Tax (General) (Wine&mdash;Deficit Reduction) Bill. Firstly, I want to point out the strength of the wine industry in Australia. The industry is very competitive. It holds 97 per cent of the Australian market, and that is even allowing for the fact that tariffs have been phased down to an ad valorem equivalent of 11 per cent from July 1993. Those tariffs will be phased down further to five per cent by July 1996. In 1992-93 imports at the level of only eight million litres were worth $47 million. The Australian wine industry is a very successful value adding export industry. Exports have grown from 11 million litres worth $21 million in 1985-86 to 103 million litres worth $293 million in 1992-93. Exports now account for almost a quarter of production. The industry has set a target for exports to total a billion dollars per annum by the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the growth and the innovation that the industry has shown, Australian wine has become widely accepted overseas as a product of high quality&mdash;a fruity and affordable product. The opposition is throwing up some arguments, without basis, as to why the wine industry should not be taxed. The opposition says that the increases in taxation are unfair on two bases&mdash;firstly, on the basis that it is a regressive tax. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is progressive taxation. A person buying a $20 bottle of wine pays commensurately more in taxation than a person paying $5 for a bottle of wine. That is seen even more clearly when the survey on household expenditure showed that as household income rises the proportion of that income spent on wine rises also. So it is progressive taxation in both those circumstances and, as such, is absolutely fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other unfair thing that the opposition claims is that there is a difference between the beer and the spirit industries and the wine industry. Of course there may be. That is recognised by the fact that there is no excise on wine. But there is not much difference. They are sold in the same establishments. They are sold in the same retail outlets. They are handled by the same wholesalers. The whole line of selling the product is the same. The consumers who buy the product overlap with the other industries. To say that there is an unfairness in the wine industry is almost beyond belief. The unfairness lies in the treatment of the beer and spirit industries, because those industries are paying and taking a lot more of the burden of the taxation than the wine industry is. That should not be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry has been in a privileged position, and, after this legislation, it still will be. There is no reason why it should be. Perhaps there has been the argument in past years that as a small, growing industry, there should be some allowance made. But when we look at the figures now which aim for a billion dollars worth of exports&mdash;and it already totals a billion dollars of production&mdash;we see it is no longer a small industry. There is no reason any more why the wine industry should be in a privileged position in relation to its main competitors. There is every reason why it should pay sales tax at the same rate as the beer and the spirit industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other argument is that the tax will affect sales&mdash;both domestic and export. That argument does not stack up either. Sales tax was introduced in August 1984 at 10 per cent on wine. At that time, sales of wine did not decrease; they increased. But the tax was at an increasing rate. In 1986 the sales tax on wine increased to 20 per cent, and sales of wine continued to increase at that time. Sales decreased between 1988 and 1990, but that was in line with decreases of sales in other similar products. So the causal relationship between domestic sales and sales tax really cannot be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point again that this is a strong, growing industry and sales will not decrease because of the wine industry being asked to pay a fair share of the taxation in line, or more in line, with its competitors. On the export side, the idea that a sales tax would decrease our export performance on wine is just beyond belief. The sales tax is not placed on exports. If anything, I suppose an argument could be made that, because there is a sales tax domestically, the industry might put more emphasis on its exports of wine. But, certainly, there can be no argument that the export performance of wine would be affected at all. The industry itself has never had any problem raising money for capital equipment, infrastructure, or development of its industry, and that position will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the general tax argument, and I find this most perplexing. At question time today the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) made the point very clearly that those opposite sit there and say, `We agree with the deficit reduction strategy' and yet, at the same time, oppose measures that are part of that deficit reduction strategy. I cannot accept the arguments that they are putting about those other things&mdash;the unfairness that I have pointed out, the export performance and the domestic sales performance&mdash;so we are left with simple obstructionism for their own reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might very well be that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who spoke earlier, enjoys his bottle of $50 chardonnay at some wine bar or bistro, but he has to remember that the beer drinker in the public bar at the Grafton Hotel is subsidising that $50 bottle of wine for him because that bottle of wine is not being taxed at a reasonable rate in relation to its competition. It is the ordinary drinkers in the pubs and the public bars who are subsidising the fancy people sitting in wine bars and bistros having a quaff of Grange Hermitage or chardonnay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures bring in a rate of 31 per cent this year, 22 per cent from 1 November, 24 per cent from 1 July 1994, and 26 per cent from July 1995. They allow the costs of acquisition and planting of vines to be written off over four years from the time of planting and they provide cash grants to eligible commercial winemakers. They maintain funding for research and development for the wine and grape industry. They convert a loan of $1 1/2 million through Austrade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that the government is not concerned about the wine industry in Australia is a long way from the truth. The government has provided assistance and support to the wine industry in many ways. We see it as a strong and vibrant industry that will continue to grow domestically and continue to reach its aim of a billion dollars of exports, but it can handle the sort of taxation that brings it closer to being reasonably taxed in comparison to its main competitors. </PARA>

We also negotiated a bilateral agreement with New Zealand, which is our second largest wine market. We have made representations to the United States and other governments to improve market access, and we participate in multilateral negotiations to remove trade barriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We administer and fund the membership of the peak intergovernmental wine organisation, the OIV, and our participation has resulted in recognition of new world winemaking practices and standards.

We have introduced legislation to implement a European Community and Australia wine agreement and to establish a mechanism to establish the names and boundaries of Australia's geographical indications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to those sales that I mentioned before, in this argument considerable emphasis has been put on the recent drop in wine sales and, of course, that is based on figures that just cannot be transferred into sales. Sales tax is paid when the wholesaler sells his goods to the retailer. A retailer would normally carry six weeks to two months stock of wine. Because of the uncertainty that the opposition and the Western Australian Greens senators have put into this industry, the consumers have not stopped buying the product but the retailers have stopped buying it from the wholesalers. It is obvious why they would do that. Whilst there is a chance that they will not have to pay the higher sales tax, they will refrain from buying and they will simply run their stocks down so that, instead of carrying six weeks or two months stock, they will carry one or two weeks stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not hard to do. It is a bit more difficult, but bear in mind the profits the retailers are able to make out of this, considering they did not pay the increase on the whole two months stock and have not purchased much since. I will guarantee the vast majority of them are charging the increase now. They are getting the windfall. The consumer is still buying and paying, and the uncertainty of this whole situation is being brought about by an opposition intent on obstructionism, wrecking and havoc, and on simply doing things in a vindictive way without any consideration for the future of Australia or the future of the wine industry, although it certainly says that it has. When we look at what has happened to the wine industry&mdash;I went through the support this government has given to it over the last 10 years&mdash;we can see that one of the reasons that it has been so successful in export markets and domestically is the assistance this government has given to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a reasonable argument to turn to that industry and say, `Your competitors pay tax at a much greater rate than you do. You are no longer an emerging small industry. You have become a vibrant strong industry. The figures back that up. There is no evidence that sales tax increases affect your sales, either domestically or internationally. There is no reason that the people who drink beer or spirits should be subsidising those people who choose to drink wine. They are very similar products and the difference in taxation is quite marked'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support this legislation. I would have strongly supported the previous legislation in the same vein. I believe it is a step backwards for the wine industry not to take a reasonable load of the burden of taxation of this country as other industries do. I think it is a real cop-out by the wine industry, supported by the opposition and the Western Australian Greens senators for their own selfish reasons, which does nothing for Australia and nothing for the wine industry. I urge those in the industry to change their minds and start thinking sensibly about fairness in taxation, about a deal that will encourage industry, enable us to give the sort of support that we need to give to the industry, and further underline the need, which the opposition recognises, of an ultimate focus on that deficit reduction strategy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The arguments of the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) are not at all convincing; in fact, he has almost argued against himself. In his summing-up he said that the wine industry must bear the cost of this increased tax. That is certainly in stark contrast to what the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was saying. I notice that the honourable member for Page is leaving the chamber. Perhaps he is going to have a glass of chardonnay. He seemed to be attacking the chardonnay drinkers in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very little can be said in defence of this legislation except to allude to those concessions which have been won by this side of the House. Without the strong stand taken by the Liberal and National parties, legislation to increase the wine tax by a mammoth 55 per cent would have been passed&mdash;it would have been law today. Now, for a mere $87 million spread over four years, the government is intent on progressively raising tax on wine. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level of wholesale sales tax for wine should at some point arrive at 32 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>So the intent of this government is quite clear and has been quite clearly spelt out by the Treasurer. The government has given no consideration to the effect such a tax hike would have on rural communities, producers, exports and rural and regional tourism&mdash;a very important component in terms of what the wine industry does for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has pig-headedly and naively dismissed such concerns in order to save face. It has saved very little face&mdash;a disputed $87 million in revenue. It is alleged that Commonwealth revenue may be as little as $40 million over the next three years, half of which would be repaid as a result of measures in the compromise package. I put it to the government that this amount is not worth risking a potential billion dollar export industry for, which is what the wine industry means to Australia. Prior to the budget being brought down by the Treasurer on 17 August this year, the wine industry had, as its target, the export of in excess of a billion dollars worth of product per year from this country by the year 2000. Since the government has moved the goalposts that target is no longer a goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the eight weeks since the government enraged growers, producers, retailers and consumers with the budget provision to increase tax on wine from 20 per cent to 31 per cent in one leap wine sales have plummeted a staggering 30 per cent. That demonstrates the effect the tax has had on domestic sales. If honourable members want evidence of the effect a tax increase on a product, an increase which differentiates from the previous regime of tax, will have on potential sales they have only to look at the government's legislation a few years ago when it increased the tax on luxury motor vehicles. Once that tax was passed hardly a luxury car was sold in this country. It decimated the incomes of the car salesmen. It was not until the government saw, within 12 months of introducing that tax, the effect of differentiating by such a large amount that it reduced the tax on those vehicles. That was clear evidence of the effect that taxation has on sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 17 August the public and stockists have been progressively withdrawing from purchasing. There has been around a $1 million per day reduction in winery shipments, a staggering figure. That is a $1 million per day reduction in shipments from the wineries of this country. Amazingly, given this evidence, the Treasurer has the audacity to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a tax which is basically on wine drinkers, not on wine producers.</PARA>
<PARA>How very wrong he is. I have news for the Treasurer. As long as this tax prohibits the sale and consumption of wine it is very much a tax on the producers. This government has been solely responsible for crippling the industry over this eight-week period; in fact, it has brought the industry to its knees. While the industry has been on its knees, the Treasurer has been out with his gun. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government now wants our permission to cripple the industry more slowly. It is proposed that the 31 per cent sales tax announced in the federal budget be wound back to 22 per cent from 1 November this year. The tax would then progressively increase to 26 per cent by 1995. It is then the Treasurer's clear intention to bump this sales tax up to 32 per cent, and he has made his intentions extremely clear on that issue. This is an unsustainable situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, in effect, is punishing a progressive, innovative and sophisticated export oriented regional business. In the past six years, exports of Australian wines have grown by 1,000 per cent, from a mere $20 million in 1986 to nearly $300 million in 1993. It is a great Australian industry, it is a great employer of Australians and it is a great export earner for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite unbelievably, the government rejects any connection between the domestic and export markets. The very naive argument has been advanced that, as exports do not attract sales tax, the budget measure would have no effect on export markets. To put this as simply as I can for the benefit of those on the government benches, market confidence is a golden rule of business. But, unfortunately, opposition members know that very few government members have ever had dirt under their fingernails in the workplace of Australian industries. Perhaps they have no idea of what that golden rule of business is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Export success obviously relies on a stable domestic product. The government's proposed 55 per cent rise in sales tax would stem export flow. Up to 13 per cent of domestic sales could evaporate and future investment capital will be diverted from export initiatives. Is that put simply enough for those on the other side of the House? I sincerely hope so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps not for the Assistant Treasurer. There is a direct correlation between a successful domestic wine industry and a successful export wine industry. One promotes the other. The profits generated by the local market are certainly used, and the wine industry has demonstrated that it uses the profits generated in a domestic market, to develop export markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also rationalises the need for an increased wine tax as a means of more equitably treating various alcoholic beverages. In particular, the Treasurer alludes to beer. I am not one to pass up a glass of beer every now and then&mdash;I am not a great chardonnay drinker; the honourable member for Page suggested that some opposition members were&mdash;but I certainly feel comfortable in suggesting that the effort taken in producing beer cannot possibly equate to the winemaking process. Wine is produced from grapes and subject to good seasons&mdash;we all know the vagaries of the seasons in this, the driest continent on earth, which is plagued by more bad seasons than good seasons. Also, wine is made only once a year and is usually matured for long periods. Beer can be produced 365 days a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a vast difference between making wine and making beer. The two are quite unrelated, and government members would certainly know that if they knew anything about winemaking and beer making. Perhaps they know more about drinking it than making it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia leads the world in winemaking research and development. The equity argument falls in a heap. The government's obsession with increasing wine tax runs contrary to the catchcry of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) of `value adding'. Unlike many of our exports, wine is manufactured here with Australian labour and know-how. This results in a product that has increased its value seven times over in its conversion from grapes to bottled wine. A seven-fold increase in value from the raw product to the ultimate value added product of a bottle of wine is certainly value adding for Australia's agricultural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the government doing to encourage such innovation? It is taxing the industry to the hilt. Perhaps the minister should look for a new catchcry because his `value adding' catchcry is certainly lost when he starts supporting a wine tax bill such as this. The opposition would like to see more tasting and less taxing of Australian wine. That is the way Australian wine will be promoted and more export markets developed. The profits from the industry will then go into developing greater export markets and dollars for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To contrast the production of wine with that of beer, one has only to look at the recent investment by Fosters in China. Where did Fosters put its value adding industry? Fosters sent money over there and invested in a brewery in Shanghai. Sure, Fosters will be using some Australian malt barley to make its beer in Shanghai, but it will not be using Australian workers. So where is all the value adding for the malt barley grown in Australia? It will be done in China. Where will all the jobs be created? They will be created in China. This contrasts with the wine industry, which is creating jobs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a vast difference between making wine and making beer in terms of value adding and creating jobs for this country. The government is taxing jobs in this country and encouraging the export of jobs. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to get the message across to the government side of the House. If this is the way that Australian industry is rewarded for value adding, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy should find himself a new swan song because the old one certainly has a dirty nest now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Particularly close to my heart is the fact that the winegrowing industry is a product of regional and rural Australia. In fact the wine industry has come to be the saviour of many rural communities in these very desperate times. The wine industry represents a growing regional employer in depressed rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the industry works to achieve its export goal of $1 billion by the year 2000, it will take regional and rural Australia with it&mdash;that is, if the government lets it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer's announcement on 13 October that the industry and the government had come to an agreement was a flexible interpretation of the English language.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government put an excise gun at our collective heads and said take the tax or we will excise you.</PARA>
<PARA>That is blackmail, not agreement. As is always the case with blackmail, there are no guarantees for the victim.

Since then I have become one of the great pub crawlers of my electorate but I have not often had a drink. One could see from my family history that I come from a long line of people who could be described as wowsers. That brings me to a point I want to make before I turn to some of the aspects raised by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and others. I do not think we should hide from the fact that we are talking about a recreational drug.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will probably not be very popular for saying that. There is a tradition in this House that when honourable members debate tobacco legislation they do not talk about the problems of tobacco; they talk about the great tobacco industry in the electorates of Maranoa, Kennedy and others in Australia. When honourable members talk about alcohol, they do not talk about the problems of alcohol such as disease and death. Recently I worked on drug law reform with members of parliament from all over Australia and we found that the problem of alcohol was significantly greater than that of other recreational drugs, especially those purchased illegally. So we need to put that into perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are strong arguments for a tax on recreational drugs, particularly when they are a major contributor to disease and death. The wine industry has been very good in the way it has encouraged moderation. It has had a recent history of responsible advertising and promotion in discouraging people from the overconsumption of wine. I commend the wine industry for that. That is one reason why I would tolerate a lower combined tax and excise on wine than on beer. The beer industry has not gone to much trouble at all in discouraging people from overconsumption; it is all about consumption. The wine industry&mdash;and I compliment it on this&mdash;has encouraged moderation. It has been a pretty responsible industry. The industry has great export potential. That is another reason why we should look on wine more favourably than we do on beer and other alcoholic products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not necessarily have to treat wine as we treat other alcoholic beverages and recreational drugs, but it is important that we get the whole thing into perspective. Comparing bottled wine and beer, under the original government proposal, the tax on a 750-millilitre bottle of wine retailing for about $4 before the budget would have increased from 45c to 65c at the 31 per cent rate, whereas a 750-millilitre bottle of full strength beer retailing for about $2 would bear a total excise and wholesale sales tax of about 63c. That is not much different. Even with the adjustment the government was proposing, there is still a significant difference between the sales tax proposed for wine and the total tax and excise placed on beer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the budget, the tax on wine was listed as 20 per cent. It was listed as 31 per cent as from budget night. From 1 November&mdash;or maybe a date to be tabled by the Assistant Treasurer&mdash;it will become 22 per cent; on 1 July 1994, 24 per cent; and on 1 July 1995, 26 per cent. This compromise has been arrived at through discussion between a responsible industry and a responsible government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another facet of the arrangements is that there will be cash grants of $1,500 for all commercial winemakers in 1993-94 payable in July 1994 to compensate for the increase in tax. That will help some of the excellent small winemakers in Eden-Monaro such as Grevillea, Lark Hill, Madew and Tilba. They are winemakers who are increasing their business through presenting a quality wine. They have blended their wineries with tourism development in our local areas in a very good way. I compliment them and other winemakers in south-eastern New South Wales and the ACT on the way in which they have developed some beautiful wines and helped to make Australia's name with the international tourists visiting the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These cash grants will help those people: $1,500 for all commercial winemakers from 1993-94 will mean more to the small winemakers than the large ones. A sum of $4,500 in 1994-95 is to be paid from July 1995 and $6,000 in 1995-96 is to be paid from July 1996. As well as that, the government has agreed to the findings of an Industry Commission inquiry into the impact of the tax. I understand that that report is due out in July 1995. The government has come to an agreement with the industry. The result of that agreement will be less money for the government&mdash;$70 million will be raised in 1993-94, $30 million in 1994-95 and $40 million in 1995-96. There will be a substantial drop in income for the government from this agreement. Nevertheless, the government has not had to sacrifice the basic objective of the budget, which is to have a change of not much more than $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment the government on the way in which it has been prepared to negotiate. That is all that can happen, recognising what has happened in the Senate. Neither the government nor the opposition has a majority in the Senate and obviously there have been protracted negotiations. I pay tribute to the government and the Australian Democrats for the way in which they have negotiated. They have been tough in their negotiations, but they have been prepared to see reason. I congratulate Senator Kernot, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, and the government negotiators, the Assistant Treasurer and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), for the way they have been able to come to an agreement with winemakers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not easy days for government. We have had protracted negotiations on a range of questions inside and outside the budget. I believe this is establishing stability for our national economy. Through the protracted negotiations and discussions now taking place, we are going to get results. They will be good results. The opposition has an obstructionist attitude. It has decided that it is only an opposition and is not really interested in putting up constructive policies nor in supporting government policies when they are correct. If the opposition is going to be like that, then we have to wear that. But, in the end, the opposition will not be helping itself because this budget will lead to stability and will give help to small, medium and large business in developing an economy which will target employment where it can really help&mdash;in small and medium business. I disagree with the comments of the honourable member for Maranoa: this will not hurt small or medium business. It will not hurt employment.

He still believes that Bill Kelty represents workers and, more importantly, that Bill Kelty cares for the unemployed when they no longer pay his organisation's union fee.

Some poor struggling winegrower battling with just the difficulties of the daily operation of running his business thinks, `That is a great idea; I need a voice in Canberra'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the Minister for Finance read out the names of winegrowers in these areas that I represent. Let me tell the parliament how that support was given. It was quite simple. There was a meeting in Mount Barker, and this is the meeting on which the Minister for Finance makes his claim that everybody is behind these measures. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know how many people were at that meeting? There were seven people. I have rung up; I have the numbers; I could give the names. One of them carried a proxy for a person who was not able to get there. That proxy vote was not allowed to be counted. What was the vote in favour of this measure? Four to three. If the proxy vote had been allowed it would have been four votes all. In the Senate, people are discovering, that means that the vote is lost, because the numbers are even.

We have Mr Croser running around the place saying that he speaks for the wine industry. He clearly does not speak for the people that I represent, and I doubt that he speaks for the people that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro represents. But Mr Croser is running around doing backdoor deals, pushed along, I am told, by the chief executive of South Australian Brewing and owner of Penfold's, and all these people who flew up here and did the original deal behind his back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a message for Mr Croser from the people whom I represent and who happened to elect me in a proper ballot: butt out, Mr Croser. The people in my electorate do not want him. They do not want his going there and trying to talk them into things that they know are not in their own interests. I have a message for Mr Helm: `I think you are a stooge; I do not think you even have a proper representative base'. He got up and said the first tax was a good idea. I do not know how many members he has in the winegrowing industry or how many members pay up from the Labor Party, but if Mr Helm&mdash;the stooge&mdash;cannot read the facts, then let us have a look at them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the implementation of any tax&mdash;the first tax was at 10 per cent, and the industry was guaranteed by this government that that would be it, there would never be any more taxes&mdash;the consumption of wine in Australia was 21.5 litres per capita. The tax went on and, for a greedy government, that was not enough. Government members thought, `We have got 10 per cent past the silly cows, we will get another 10 per cent'. So they increased the tax to 20 per cent. This is what the honourable member for Eden-Monaro did to his winegrowers that he bleats about today. The government added another 20 per cent and, bingo, there was almost a vertical fall&mdash;it is on a graph for your information, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and consumption of wine in Australia dropped to 17.6 litres per capita. This figure was just starting to clamber back when the industry got hit between the eyes again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say again to these so-called representatives who represent nobody but themselves and have hopes of ingratiating themselves with government, the Crosers and the Helms, `Butt out'. To the credit of the Greens, they travelled to Margaret River. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who has just left the chamber, travels there occasionally, but he goes straight to Ron Edwards's beach house. He does not go around and knock on any winegrowers' doors, and at this stage it is unlikely that he would. He would probably be found drowned in a wine vat, which he would probably think was a pretty fair way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that this tax is no good. The individual winegrowers do not want the help of the government's taxation and they are desperately concerned as to the future of their industry when they see what the last two tax impositions have done to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The winegrowers are developing a wonderful export industry for Australia. Nobody with one ounce of economic understanding or education would argue against the fact that no industry can export competitively unless it has a substantial local sales base. This measure is about destroying that base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), made a very compelling point when he pointed out that right up to the time of screwing the cork in the bottle&mdash;when we export wine&mdash;we make the bottle, the cork, the cardboard carton; we grow the grapes; most of the fertilisers are produced here; and it leaves the country in that form. We have a government that keeps bleating about value adding. Here is the industry that is doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) got up and said that the poor old beer drinker was subsidising the wine drinker. There is no suggestion that the government is going to lower beer excise as part of this measure. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you may remember, that it was this government that put automatic indexation on beer&mdash;the working man's drink. Government members did not want to come in here, as they are doing now, trying to explain an increase in taxes&mdash;they hid it. They hid it by way of automatic indexation linked to the CPI. What is a major component of the CPI? It is beer. So there is an automatic guaranteed increase. What poppycock it is for the honourable member for Page to come in here and say that there is a cross-subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government said it was putting 10 per cent on wine and taking five per cent off beer, there would be some logic in that argument. But it is not doing that. Twice in the forthcoming year the beer excise will go up again without any involvement of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that when our breweries go overseas, be it, as the honourable member for Maranoa pointed out, to China&mdash;and look at all the investment that has gone into England over time&mdash;the only thing the breweries generally take with them are their brand names. They take nothing else. A couple of executives might get a job if they are lucky; the rest of it is done locally and employs local people. The wine industry is an industry that is different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that I am fed up. The message is clear; I have given the facts. I hope, and I am sure, the Greens in the other place do understand. They have been down to Margaret River. They have met the people. They know how those people feel, and they know that winegrowers are people that generally have a deep commitment to the environment. They are people who have left other jobs, in many cases to go there, to get closer to nature and to produce things which grow and which they can be proud of, considering what they are about. These are the points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is great credit going to the opposition, particularly, for recognising the importance of this industry, for showing courage from day one. There is no mucking about with us. Two days after the budget, we told the government where we stood on the wine tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the whole debate is over, and we have won, we will be stating exactly the same position because those are the facts. We have seen the government carrying on, but what enrages me are the likes of Helm and Croser selling people out. There has been no ballot. They have not thought to say,`Okay, you are all members; you all have an interest. Would you like to vote on this?'. No, they sneak around and do deals behind people's backs instead. For that they should be condemned because the great bulk of winegrowers and wine producers in Australia want nothing to do with this tax. They will take the pain. Unlike Mr Croser&mdash;who is probably geared up to about 70 per cent and has his bank manager ringing him every day&mdash;they will hang in there and keep working because they know that this tax will kill their industry. I have had enough of these fellows. I have a clear message for them: they should go and talk to the people who genuinely work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us stop and think what Mr Croser and his mates should have done. There is clear evidence that the industry has lost a lot of sales, and that that is an aberration. A lot of people have stocks of wine, large or small, and they have said to themselves, `I may as well use that up until the price is sorted out'. They are not buying much at the moment, but when these bills are eventually defeated&mdash;as they will be&mdash;they will be buying again at the old sales tax rate. Instead of Mr Croser flying over here to do a backdoor deal with the government, and flying over to Western Australia to sell it to seven people when there are hundreds in the industry over there, he might have investigated his legal right to go to the courts. He could have said to the courts, `This is past a joke. It is now time that you, Mr High Court, find through the common law'&mdash;about which we have heard plenty in recent times in connection with the Mabo debate and other matters&mdash;`that this is not fair enough, and instruct the government to desist. You should tell it that it has no right to continue to require the industry to collect a tax which the government has almost no chance of getting through the parliament'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what Mr Croser could have been doing with the resources of his bosses, the South Australian Brewing Co. and Penfolds. It will be a while before I drink any more of the products of those companies because I am insulted by what they have done. The money could have been used to overcome the only thing that is preventing sales. Also, undertakings could have been asked for&mdash;undertakings which would have been given by a majority of members of this parliament&mdash;that under no circumstances would any measure be passed at this time unless it was prospective; in other words, unless the tax were to be imposed from the date of royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what could have been done in place of this slimy deal with the government&mdash;a deal without any serious approval from the membership. The membership was never consulted. Those people just got the members, got their cheques and then sold the growers out. Those are the facts. It is an outrageous situation, and I have no time for people like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth looking at what the effect might be on the industry. I can quote no better authority than Senator Richardson. Immediately these measures were announced, Senator Richardson was reported on South Australian radio as having said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree that some of the smaller wineries will not sustain the tax increase," he said . . . There was a clear need to "rationalise" the wine industry. And that means wineries will die off.</PARA>
<PARA>That was Senator Richardson's message for the winegrowers. And people wonder why the 100 of them who met the other day in Mount Barker did not want his solution. With the exception of Penfolds and other big guys who have expediency written all over them, the winegrowing industry is made up of little people. Because of my portfolio responsibility, and my responsibility to the people who had the faith to vote for me and who expect me to protect them, I have a lot of time for those little guys. They make the wine industry what it is and they make wine worth drinking. Today wine is probably more of a science than an art but when people find that exclusive little place, they know that there will be something different or special about the wine. That is what wine drinking is all about. That is why it is a tradition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I completely reject the remarks of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro about wine being unhealthy. The fact is that in moderation&mdash;we would all of us, myself in particular, agree with the concept of moderation&mdash;it is healthy. Even the honourable member gave winegrowers credit for advising people that wine should only be drunk socially and in moderation. Winegrowers have made a special point of doing that, yet they know they cannot survive if there is an ever-increasing price for their product. I note, too, that the honourable member for Page bemoaned the role of the beer drinker. It is not as though beer drinkers only drink beer. Large numbers of them drink wine, and why should they pay more?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spent 25 years in the liquor industry, running hotels and that sort of thing. In the days of Malcolm Fraser's government, I made a speech in this place warning my colleagues how extensive the taxation regime on alcohol was. I used the example of spirits, which happen to be the worst hit because they are subject to excise, sales tax and state government charges. State government charges now are generally around 11 per cent&mdash;and the state gets its share last. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, the increase we are discussing today was to be 21 per cent and then 31 per cent, an overall increase in tax of 55 per cent. For the time being we are talking about something less than that. Once the heat goes off this issue the government will be back, as was the case when the increase went from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, and from 20 per cent to 31 per cent, saying, `Okay, we found we pushed them a bit hard. We will come back to 26 per cent and get the other five per cent later'. Doubtless that is what has been said around the cabinet table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a promise of an inquiry. Today I made the point that there are presently about seven inquiries going on around the country. An inquiry is what a government has when it has no solution. It is tokenism; it never delivers anything. It is a way of fobbing people off. The industry is very silly if it accepts that it will get anything from it, be it conducted by the Industry Commission or anyone else. How many Industry Commission inquiries has the government accepted in recent times? Only the other day, the government castigated the commission for its report on regionalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This 31 per cent, which is an increase of 55 per cent, will have 11 per cent put on top of it because that is what the states will rake off. For the time being we are talking about a maximum of 26 per cent, which is a 24 per cent increase in the tax. Again, that will have one or more per cent added to it simply because of the 11 per cent state tax. All these factors will eventually kill the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that I am fed up with these so-called representatives who have no genuine base, who have not genuinely consulted, and who certainly have not held the sort of plebiscite that is warranted in this area. A hundred votes in Margaret River makes some sense to me compared to the seven at Mount Barker which the Minister for Finance drew to our attention today. He did not give us the numbers, of course.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to follow the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) today in this debate on the sales tax bills when we recognise that yesterday, 18 October, was the 13th anniversary of the election in 1980 when both the honourable member and seven of us on this side of the parliament were actually elected. It does not appear that over that time he has changed or learned much. He is still sitting in opposition, and he will stay there while his party continues to push forward the sorts of policies he is espousing this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go back to 1984, when the first 10 per cent wholesale sales tax was imposed on wine and we heard almost the same speeches we are hearing tonight about what a disaster that tax would be for the industry. At that stage I had the job of chairing the prime ministerial committee and the then Prime Minister's task force. We visited all the wine areas, and not just in the way that the Greens have recently done. We have been doing it for a long time. In 1984 we were told the same stories&mdash;that it would be the end of the industry, that the industry would lose sales and collapse. The fact is that domestic wine sales grew from 320 million litres in 1984-85 to 331 million litres in 1987-88, and that was before the industry got into the export business, which it is very strongly into today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales did decline in the later period of 1988-89 when they dropped back to a floor of 296 million litres. That decline had more to do with a drop in the tax on low alcohol beer than it did with the tax on wine. We have this same argument again being put by the opposition that if there is an adjustment in the taxes the consumer will not buy the product. That argument was put in 1984, but the consumer continued to buy the product. The argument that the consumer will stop buying the product has been used every time there has been an excise increase, but there is no evidence to support that. There is usually a slight blip&mdash;as there is at the present time&mdash;while prices are sorted out. This tax is in the wholesale area. Indications in the first couple of weeks are that there will be a drop off in sales, but they will gradually pick up. Domestic sales have recovered since that drop in sales in 1988-89&mdash;a time of so-called gloom and doom, a recession, when one would expect that sales, having gone down, would possibly stay down&mdash;having moved from 296 million litres in 1990-91 to 315 million litres in 1991-92 and 312 million litres in 1992-93, and strong sales are continuing to show up. Opposition speakers, when speaking in relation to this matter, have presented a crazy argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Epicure</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">: Food &amp; Drink</EMPHASIS>, which is a section in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. I perused it today and noticed the advertisements for wines for sale in Australia. There is a great range of them. Harry's Liquor has most wines at $7.99. There are some at $8.99 and some at $5.99. Wine is not an expensive item. When we do the figures, we can see how much extra the consumer will have to pay for those wines. A bottle of wine costing $8 at the wholesale level, with a 21 per cent wholesale sales tax, will cost an extra $1.65 a bottle. If we take that same $8 bottle and put the 31 per cent tax on it&mdash;a so-called 55 per cent increase if the figures are used that way&mdash;we find that the tax is $2.50 a bottle. That is an increase of $1 or $1.10. That $1 was supposedly going to be so calamitous for the wine industry that nobody would buy wine any more. But it is all part of the government's package of tax cuts and other measures which have been put in place in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know that, if the tax cuts go through, many Australian consumers will be getting tax cuts ranging from $6 to $20 per week. If those receiving the lowest tax cuts want to spend their tax cuts on wine, they can buy an extra six bottles before the tax causes them to pay more per bottle. The total budget package, including the government's tax measures, being put through the parliament is clearly justified. It is giving tax cuts so that an industry such as the wine industry can easily absorb a $1 a bottle increase. But the tax cuts go not only to wine drinkers but to everybody. There are many families which are waiting for those tax cuts to go through the Senate so that they may spend the money on other goods, if they do not choose to spend the extra $1 on a bottle of wine. So the debate on these measures is not just about the sales tax on wine but on the overall budget package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After listening to the honourable member for O'Connor, I am clearly of the belief that those opposite are not interested in the budget issue but are peddling the same arguments they used in 1983. With its 36 votes in the Senate, the opposition was able to give great support to the minority parties, and that created a bargaining situation. We have heard a vitriolic speech from the honourable member for O'Connor attacking the wine industry and its representatives because the industry has been able to negotiate an agreement. It recognised that the impasse was being created by the opposition. Remember that it is the opposition that is causing the impasse. Without its 36 votes, the Greens do not have any power in the Senate, and neither do the Democrats. It is only when the opposition decides to block a budget measure that the Greens and the Democrats have any power at all. We should sheet home where the problem lies: it lies with the opposition and members such as the honourable member for O'Connor. It is a farce for them to say anything different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the situation where the negotiations have been completed. A heads of agreement has been worked out between the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the President of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, Mr Brian Croser, which was signed on 13 October 1993. That agreement provides for a phased increase in the wholesale sales tax for wine to 22 per cent from 1 November 1993, or an earlier date if agreed by the parliament; 24 per cent from 1 July 1994, and 26 per cent by 1 July 1995. The 31 per cent rate will apply until 1 November 1993 or an earlier date if we can get the measure through the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This agreement also allows for the cost of acquisition and planting of vines to be written off for taxation purposes over four years. So the industry has been able to negotiate some benefits for itself on the basis that consumers will be paying extra for wine, and some of that money will be going back to the industry. There will be cash grants to eligible winemakers of $1,500 for 1993-94, $4,500 for 1994-95 and $6,000 for 1995-96, to be paid at the end of each financial year. There is also an agreement that funding for research and development will be maintained and an agreement to waive the industry's obligation to repay a $1.5 million international trade enhancement scheme loan granted earlier this year. The agreement also provides a further $1 million grant for assistance to export market development and for a working party to be set up consisting of representatives from the minister's office, the department, the Winegrape Growers Council of Australia and the Winemakers Federation of Australia. There will also be an industry development reference on the wine industry to the Industry Commission to report no later than June 1995. That is a fairly solid package that has been negotiated in lieu of the changes that did not get through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package has also been negotiated on the understanding that the wine industry is very concerned that the Senate, with the support of the opposition, has set out to obstruct the government's budget and to create the uncertainty that is causing the problems at the present time. Honourable members who have spoken prior to me on the second reading have explained why there would be a drop in sales at the wholesale level while people wait to see what the final prices will be. That is understandable in any business when there is a run-down of stocks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission inquiry is to be chaired by the IC chairman and will consist of a member drawn by a panel nominated by the WFA and a member agreed to by both industry and government. The terms of reference will include an examination of the industry and its potential to contribute to the Australian economy, including its contribution to regional economies; the appropriate form and level of taxation of wine beyond June 1996; and the timing and extent of any increase in cash grants to accompany any increase in taxation. These are the measures that have been thrashed out between the government and the industry. In the last half hour in this House these measures have been given a fairly solid sort of bagging by the honourable member for O'Connor. While he might boycott some of the wines that he discussed in his speech, I do not think the industry will mind his decision. The wine industry is a very important industry in which this government has had an obvious interest for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all the time that I have been in parliament I have been actively involved on committees that have worked with the wine industry. We have certainly seen it grow from strength to strength. We know and understand that the industry at present is looking at something like $1.2 billion worth of investment because it understands the opportunities that there are in the export area. Apart from the support given through bilateral government to government negotiations, the government has assisted the industry in many ways. The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation received $1.37 million in the six years to 1991-92, and wine exporters received $26.3 million in the seven years to 1992-93 in export market development grants. I heard the honourable member for O'Connor say that the Greens went to the Margaret River area and had discussions. As far as he is concerned, that is the most important issue as to why the legislation will not get through the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures that I am putting on the record have been part of the ongoing discussions with this industry for the past 13 years. The industry respects the fact and clearly understands that its future lies in exports and the opportunities that have been created. That involvement over six years&mdash;$1.37 million, as I have said, through the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation with wine exporters to receive $26.3 million in export market development grants in seven years&mdash;shows that this government does care for that industry; and certainly is not about to send it broke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is also providing financial support for research and development. In the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation's first two years of operation it received $2.8 million in Commonwealth contributions and will receive a further $1.7 million in 1993-94. In addition, the Commonwealth is providing $12.42 million over seven years to support the establishment of a cooperative research centre for viticulture, which will further strengthen the industry's research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other grants received by the industry since 1986 include $542,000 under the marketing skills program, $94,340 under the Rural Industries Business Extension Service and $598,579 under the innovative agricultural marketing programs. The wine industry has recently been advised of its successful application for a $1.5 million loan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that has been sent back from the Senate has been negotiated in a way that we believe is very important for the industry and the nation. We have recognised that with the obstructionist approach of the opposition, the original intention of the tax measures will not be achieved. However, the government realises the importance of keeping open its lines of communication with the industry and has set out to continue to assist the industry very significantly and to attempt urgently to get this legislation through the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until that legislation goes through the parliament, the industry will be uncertain and extremely concerned as to which way the matter will go. It is expected that today we will know the position of the Greens. There is still negotiation time. We know for sure that members of the opposition do not intend to move in relation to this. They are making themselves absolutely non-participatory in negotiations on all issues, simply because of the mentality that they will obstruct and cause as much difficulty as they can in the budgetary processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support the changes that have been put before the House in this legislation that we are sending back to the Senate. I hope that commonsense will prevail. If the opposition, as a whole, is still saying that it will not pass the legislation, maybe one or two members opposite will express their views as liberals; perhaps even cross the floor at some stage and vote according to what the industry wishes, rather than listening to the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) who seems to be having a lot to say on this topic. Anybody can lead the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) down any garden path because he does not appear to have a position on any of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support what the government is proposing and hope that in the next day or so we will clearly see commonsense prevail and the legislation will go through the parliament. The industry can then settle down, some of the $1.2 billion worth of investment that people are considering at present will come to fruition, we will have further growth in our exports of wine and there will be assistance to the nation's economy. The more we can sell overseas, the better off this country will be. I am sure the industry has confidence in itself. It does not need the problem of getting the legislation through the Senate, the stalling and creating of uncertainty, when investment and confidence are what it requires. I am sure the industry will go from strength to strength and Australian consumers will still be able to buy and consume the world's best wines at the world's cheapest prices. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out to the House that the debate is about accountability. The Australian electorate is demanding the accountability of the politicians; the accountability of government members for what they promised or did not promise in the March 1993 election, as opposed to what has been presented to the people in the August 1993 budget. People are demanding that accountability. They deserve to get it and the opposition is endeavouring to provide it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been labelled obstructionists, economic vandals and wreckers; but the public is calling the government deceitful. The government has been blatantly deceitful in making promises and policy on the run in the March election campaign and doing an about-face in this year's budget. The only things in the budget that were spoken about during the election campaign were the tax cuts. The opposition agreed to support the tax cuts when they were promised, not as they were intrinsically linked, initially, to tax increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine tax debate has been very interesting. Let us look at a little of the history of taxation on the wine industry. As a number of speakers from both sides of the chamber have said, the Labor Party started taxing the wine industry in 1984, after promising during the previous election campaign, which it won, that it would not introduce any taxes on the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It introduced a tax of 10 per cent in 1984. In 1986 the government increased that to 20 per cent&mdash;a 50 per cent increase. What has happened in 1993? The Labor government wants to increase that tax on wine by 55 per cent. We can argue until the cows come home the pros and cons of why we should be taxing the wine industry compared with beer, spirits or anything else. What is the relativity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But right at the heart of this matter is the question of why we should be increasing taxes. The reason is that we have a big taxing, big spending Labor government. It needs the money to try to trim back an enormous budget deficit. It is continually looking for ways it can increase taxes on a productive sector of this country. In picking on the wine industry, it has picked on a major growth industry, an industry that is growing in exports and generating import replacement products in Australia&mdash;an industry that is serving Australia well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite are trying to bring it down. Why would they do that? They need to raise more money to pay for the big spending, unfunded programs that were promised in March 1993. That is why we have to speak to members of the wine industry, credit unions and fuel consumers. We have looked at the problem of accrued annual leave. We are increasing taxes on all these things. Every year, year in and year out, the government is talking about increasing taxes. It is doing that because of its unfunded, big spending programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget measures we started off with a proposal to increase the tax on wine from 20 per cent to 31 per cent which, being an overall increase of 55 per cent, is a massive increase in anyone's language. There was no question of it being tied to the CPI and being done quietly without coming through the parliament each year. It was an up front 55 per cent increase&mdash;whack! Cop that, wine industry. </PARA>

Cassegrain is earning export dollars for Australia, and it deserves to have a say in this debate about the tax on the wine industry. One of the previous speakers from this side of the House made a very good point: anyone who has been in business, and anyone who has been in this place long enough, ought to know that we do not have a strong export industry without that industry having an even stronger domestic base. Our wine industry has that strong domestic base, and that is the platform from which it leaps into the world market. If we start eroding the industry, weakening it with these tax measures, we are going to slow the industry down&mdash;and not just economically; we will attack the morale of the industry. At the moment morale is very high, but this government is doing its damnedest to attack the morale of the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time we debate some of the budget measures&mdash;whether it is the fuel tax, the wholesale sales tax, the wine tax, the FBT, or the credit union tax&mdash;we keep hearing those opposite say, `We have been re-elected to govern'. But the government has not been given a mandate for these taxes. The government did not tell the Australian people in March 1993 that it was going to introduce these taxes. The government has no mandate for these taxes; nor does the winemakers association have a complete mandate from its membership and from the wine industry in Australia to do a deal with the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor talked about the wine industry in his area of Western Australia. I am telling the House about the wine industry on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. The wine industry in my electorate did not have any input into the agreement that was made between Mr Brian Croser, the president of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, and the Treasurer where they agreed on legislation for increases in sales tax on wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cassegrain company received information from Mr Croser about the agreement reached with the Treasurer, and the first point mentioned is the most interesting one. A rate of 31 per cent will exist from 17 August to 1 November this year. The government has been collecting that extra 11 per cent sales tax on wine right across Australia from 17 August, and will continue to collect it until, when and if it gets wiped out on 1 November. The government has been collecting that tax illegally. It has not been passed by both Houses of this parliament. It has not had royal assent from the Governor-General of Australia. It is not law. Yet, by this backdoor agreement the government is going to try to make it law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia have been paying the wine tax, and they have also been paying the extra tax on the fuel that they use. I believe that the government has been collecting it illegally. These budget bills have not been passed by both Houses, and they have not been signed off by the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 1 November a rate of 22 per cent&mdash;a two per cent increase this year&mdash;will be applied. Thereafter we will have a rate of 24 per cent after 1 July 1994, a four per cent increase on this year; and a rate of 26 per cent from 1 July 1995, a six per cent increase on this year. What offset is the industry getting? The only offset that Mr Croser has obtained is the provision of cash grants by the government to eligible commercial winemakers: $1,500 in respect of 1993-94, $4,500 in respect of 1994-95, and $6,000 in respect of 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increased rate from 17 August until 1 November is going to cost the wine industry in my electorate $10,000. Winemakers are going to have to write out a cheque for $10,000 to the Tax Office. That is the extra cost to them. How long is it going to take to get those cash grants of $1,500, $4,500 and $6,000 back?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This industry is going along quite smoothly and is keeping its nose above water. In most cases, the industry is struggling with the tyranny of distance from the capital cities, from the marketplaces and from the export centres. The industry is struggling with the government's industrial relations policy, with the superannuation guarantee levies, and with the training levies. Now the government wants to hit it between the eyes with an increase in sales tax. It is just not fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past few years this government has been trying to find a sector of our community&mdash;whether it is PAYE taxpayers, a thriving domestic industry, or a thriving export industry&mdash;and tax it more. The taxation base in this country is getting narrower and narrower, and the burden that the government is loading on that narrower taxation base is getting heavier and heavier. Why? The reason is because we have had a big taxing, big spending Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken at great length with the representatives of the wine industry in my electorate to ascertain what they think about the moves that the government is making on their industry. Today I received a fax containing a number of interesting points. A number of points differ substantially from the information that Mr Brian Croser discussed with the Treasurer when they made their deal seven days ago. As I said, there was very little consultation with a lot of the small boutique premium winemakers in Australia. In the facsimile I received this afternoon, Mr Claude Cassegrain said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Wine Industry has two components:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Premium Wine&mdash;20%</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non Premium Wine&mdash;80%</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non Premium Wine&mdash;is equally in competition with Beer as it is with Premium Wine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Premium Wine is not in competition with beer, or other forms of non wine alcoholic beverage, it is in direct competition with non premium wine.</PARA>
<PARA>It is also in direct competition with imports from places like France and America and other wine producing countries. Mr Cassegrain went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Premium Wine can only be produced from quality grapes the fermented juice of which must be cellared for a considerable length of time to become a premium product. It is principally a natural product and a natural process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-Premium wines are made from non quality grapes. The fermented juice of non quality grapes cannot become a premium wine as they break down before maturity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Premium Wines are the market leaders for Australian Exports. The bulk of Australian wine exports are non premium wines. Australian Premium Wines have created the Australian Export wine market. The non premium wines which are exploiting the good name created by the premium wines are also dependent upon the low Aussie Dollar value. The premium wines are basically independent of the exchange rate. When, and if, the Australian Dollar strengthens the non premium wine export market is predicted to evaporate. The premium wine export opportunities will also evaporate if in the meanwhile the industry is allowed to be destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what is happening. Since 1984 the government has taxed, taxed, taxed those productive sectors of our economy that are building export markets. The government is destroying the industry. Mr Claude Cassegrain went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We note the Government has been advocating the importance to Australian industries to maximise the value adding to our National and International products.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it was the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) who explained to the House earlier this afternoon how this industry would have to be at the cutting edge of value adding industries in Australia. Mr Cassegrain said:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cassegrain says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Premium wine industry is an "import replacement" competitor. The non-premium wine industry does not contribute to this National benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current sales tax at 20% and licence fees of 13% (also on the 20%) is estimated to have the result that 20% of the industry raises 60% of the Government revenue from the wine industry. This is an intolerable and inequitable burden and makes a mockery of Governments exalting the National need for industry to practise excellency in product and maximisation of the value adding for export and import replacement opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Premium Wine industry by its nature has a large percentage of production consumed in "tastings" and "samples". These are a cost to production and should be exempt from both licence fees and sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important point. Samplings and tastings should be exempt from both licence fees and sales tax. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-premium wine for example does not have this cost and is marketed more like beer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If sales tax and licence fees were to be shared equitably throughout the wine industry the premium sector of the industry's consumer price would drop by as much as 25% and therefore be within the reach of most Australians, currently the premium industries product is taxed out of the reach of most Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to make a few more points before my time runs out. Mr Cassegrain, who is involved in the wine industry in my electorate, made reference to the heads of agreement between the Treasurer and the Winemakers Federation of Australia. I will go through it in point form, as it is in the reference to the heads of agreement. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1We submit that if there is to be a tax, tax should be on volume and not value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2The cost of acquisition and planting the vines is a very small (say less than 5%) of the cost of developing the vineyard over four years and is an incidental cost and not worthy of discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3The deletion of sales tax on samples and tastings is much more efficient and appropriate. The Government and industry costs of administration of cash grants will make a mockery of the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4It is preferable for industry to carry and direct its own R &amp; D without the interference of Governments. It cost industry via taxation $2.50 for the Government to spend $1.00 in R &amp; D&mdash;a very poor return. It is in the national interest that taxes be reduced and industry carry its own R &amp; D responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5No comments&mdash;not worthy of discussion considering we are talking of the survival of a primary industry representing some billions in investment for the sake of one and a half million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6The Winemakers Federation of Australia has not addressed the problems of the premium wine sector of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7We believe that a proper enquiry should include in its brief the matters raised in these notes to you. The figures we have given you are preliminary estimates and proper analysis should be undertaken so that Parliament is able to make informed decisions. This cannot be done in the short term.</PARA>
<PARA>On that point, if we are going to have another Industry Commission inquiry into this industry, let us make it relevant. Let us have people on it that do not come out of the capital cities, that do not represent the bulk wine producers. Let us have people having input into that Industry Commission inquiry that also represent the premium wine producers of Australia. Let us make it a responsible inquiry that will not just pay lip-service to this industry as so many committees of inquiry do that are set up by the government. Let us not just get it out of this House, get it out of the way, get it out of the newspapers and get a lid on it, but let us make the inquiry fair dinkum, because we have an industry here that is doing great things for Australia. Let us not cripple it. Let us not cut it off at the knees. Let us not shoot it between the eyes when it is in its infancy and just getting going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cassegrains, premium winemakers in Port Macquarie, in the mid-north coast of New South Wales, as I said earlier, are exporting in excess of 30 per cent of their production to places such as Japan, the places we need to deal with to balance our trade. We need these exports industries and we need to support them. We do not need to keep on knocking them down by increasing the burden of tax, by increasing the burden of government regulation on these industries. Coalition members are not arguing the case in this instance because we are spoilers, because we are wreckers. We are arguing the case because we want, on behalf of the people of Australia, to hold this government accountable for what it said in March 1993. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

So there are in fact several industry groups involved with this agreement. The agreement provides for a phased-in increase in wholesales sales tax applying to wine such that that will move to a 22 per cent rate in November of this year, a 24 per cent rate in July 1994 and a 26 per cent rate in July 1995. In addition, costs associated with vine planting and acquisition can be written off for tax purposes over four years. Cash grants will be made available to winegrowers of up to $1,500 in this financial year, up to $4,500 in the next financial year and up to $6,000 in the 1995-96 financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has agreed to waive the repayment of the loan of $1.5 million under the international trade enhancement scheme to the industry and has also provided for a further $1 million export assistance grant. These are the main features of the package which, at the end of the day and in spite of the comments of the previous speaker, have in fact been endorsed by the representative bodies of the industry. Although the agreement provides for higher taxation, it also ensures the provision of significant targeted assistance to the industry, which now exports almost one-quarter of its production and which aims for an export target, with the support of the government, of $1 billion worth of exports by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When government proposes changes in tax regimes it is very common for particular sectors affected to cry wolf. Many honourable members here will no doubt recall the outrage that came forth in response to the introduction of the fringe benefits tax in the mid-1980s. The Australian restaurant industry was going to die. This outrageous new tax was going to destroy our flourishing industry. Of course, nothing of the sort has happened and, in reality, the impact of the fringe benefits tax on the restaurant industry&mdash;which I am proud to say has a very significant presence in my electorate&mdash;has been minimal. It is a very common phenomenon to grossly exaggerate the impact of taxes such as these on sales and production. I suggest to honourable members that that is precisely what is occurring here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the capital gains tax, we saw exactly the same sort of scaremongering. It was going to destroy middle-class thrift and capital accumulation when in fact all it has done is remove one of the more blatant mechanisms of tax avoidance which was being widely used at the time. Incidentally, it was also distorting the pattern of investment in this country to the detriment of those who sought to invest in productive job creating activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Lyne, the wholesales sales tax on wine was first introduced by the Labor government in August 1984 at a rate of 10 per cent. It was then increased to the rate of 20 per cent in August 1986. In both instances, no reductions in sales of wine occurred in the years following those tax changes. In fact, in the 1984-85 financial year, the sales of wine in this country increased by seven per cent, and in 1985-86 they increased by roughly 12.6 per cent. It is fair to say, before we get too carried away with those statistics, that a significant proportion of that additional taxation was absorbed by winemakers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his correction&mdash;by makers and growers. So those statistics need be read in the qualified sense, but it is equally true to point out that that tax did not entail disaster for the industry. It illustrates the fact that we are dealing essentially&mdash;although there are variations across the different products&mdash;with a relatively price inelastic product. I suggest to honourable members opposite that time will tell that it is ultimately the consumer who will carry the burden of this tax increase, not the grower or the maker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conditions in the mid-1980s were, admittedly, significantly better than they are now. We are still struggling our way out of recession. There has been a slight but nonetheless significant decline in sales of wine since the 1990-91 period, which is partly linked to the recession but also linked to healthier lifestyles, changes in consumption patterns, anti-alcohol abuse campaigns and issues of this nature. However, sales have been steadily recovering since the dip in the 1990-91 period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to this, it is also worth pointing out that broad conditions in recent times have been quite favourable to the industry. The lower level of the dollar, a stable low inflation rate, the recent introduction of a lower company tax regime, dividend imputation and the 10 per cent additional investment allowance are all examples of factors which have substantially assisted not only the wine industry but also other industries in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gradual increase in the tax on wine, which is now envisaged in this package, is fair, particularly in light of the longstanding favourable treatment that wine has enjoyed with respect to taxation in this country relative to other beverages, the most crucial of which is beer. For many years ordinary working-class Australians have borne the brunt of taxation in this area. Beer drinkers have been slugged, while middle-class wine drinkers have got off very lightly. Naturally, as I am sure the honourable member opposite will probably wish to point out, the equation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know which electorate he represents. The equation is not quite as simple as that, and certainly consumption patterns and class divisions in this country have become blurred a great deal. But the fact still remains that beer and wine consumption patterns in this nation are significantly different in terms of occupational and class background and, even with the tax increases envisaged by the government and with the original proposal, the taxation on wine would still be substantially lower than the taxation on beer. In fact, on the lower priced wine the tax would be less than half of the tax on beer. Of course, the differential would be different on the higher priced wines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been interesting to hear opposition members refer to the alleged regressive nature of not only this tax measure but also other tax measures that have been taken in the budget. It is also amusing to hear the honourable member for Lyne refer to this `high taxing, high spending' Labor government, a government which now has the lowest proportion of public sector spending in the OECD, the lowest tax take in the OECD and which is the only government in this country for decades which has actually managed to bring in several budget surpluses. I think it gives a very good illustration of the type of government that many members on the other side of the House would favour if we were ever unfortunate enough to see them in government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has put forward a case based on a new found concern for lower income earners in this country. Recently the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) made a speech to the Council for National Interest, which has one or two connections with the National Civic Council in Victoria. I am not sure what the New South Wales branch of this interesting shadowy organisation is like. In this speech the honourable member for Higgins suggested that the Liberal Party should be reaching out to blue-collar workers as a new constituency&mdash;following the lead apparently established by Ronald Reagan and, to a degree, Margaret Thatcher&mdash;and that perhaps this was a new dawn for the Liberal Party and would represent a major change in the distribution of political power and influence in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent probably a few more blue-collar workers in my electorate than the honourable member for Higgins does in his electorate. I represented white-collar workers as a union official, although a very high proportion of those people were from blue-collar families, blue-collar backgrounds. I think I can give a bit of useful advice to the honourable member for Higgins on this issue, and that is to forget about the posturing, to forget about the crocodile tears about the budget and its supposed regressive impact on low income earners, and to forget about the false concern for the lower skilled and unemployed, because&mdash;I hate to say it&mdash;these people actually realise what the Liberal track record is. Like most people, they go by deeds rather than words. They recognise that the Liberal track record is a fraction different from the current rhetoric. They do not have to look back to Fightback. They do not have to look back to the GST, to the deregulated labour market&mdash;which would leave the lower skilled and the industrially weak gradually deteriorating to positions of $5 an hour wage rates, as is the case in places such as the United States or its equivalents&mdash;or to the destruction of Medicare. They do not even have to go to the most obvious examples of the true position of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All people need to do, as I have said in this place recently, is to come to Victoria, where the honourable member for Higgins comes from. They should come and see the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party in government and its deep concern for the interests of blue-collar workers; the deregulation of the industrial relations system, which effectively gives all power to employers; the destruction of Workcare and the removal of adequate protection and benefits for seriously injured workers, the bulk of whom, because of the nature of their work, are blue-collar workers; the closure of schools; drastic cuts to community health centres which, by and large, service the interests of lower income earners and blue-collar workers; and substantial increases in rents in high-rise estates. They should come and talk to some of the blue-collar workers in places like Kensington and Richmond who have had a $25 a week increase in their rents. This is all from Jeff Kennett, the Liberal Premier of Victoria, showing deep heartfelt concern for the interests of blue-collar workers. They should come to the area represented by the previous speaker on this side, the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham), and see what the gutting of the SEC in Victoria is doing to a conservative blue-collar community in the Latrobe Valley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the people that the honourable member for Higgins believes that the Liberal Party can reach out to, can develop as a new political constituency. Opposing and seeking to wreck the government's tax initiatives, including the tax initiatives on the wine industry, is one way of doing it. I suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that, unfortunately, no matter what protestations can be made in this place, in practice the Liberal Party stands for quite the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revised proposals regarding taxation of wine are, as has been conceded by the honourable member for Lyne, supported and endorsed by Mr Brian Croser, the President of the Winemakers Federation, and the other industry organisations that I mentioned. They represent a reasonable, moderate extension of the tax burden to an industry which has been relatively lightly taxed in the past, particularly in comparison with the brewing industry, and an industry which can bear the burden. It is an industry where the burden will ultimately be passed on to consumers, the bulk of whom can bear that burden because predominantly they will be higher income earners, particularly because in effect it is an ad valorem tax rather than a volume tax. It was interesting to note the honourable member for Lyne suggesting&mdash;obviously representing the interests of a particular segment of the wine industry&mdash;that it would be better for it to be a tax on volume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to some general comments about the budget process and to the implications of the behaviour of the opposition for this process in our parliament. At first blush one may believe that the confusion that has occurred since August&mdash;I certainly concede that there has been significant confusion as a result of the situation in the Senate&mdash;is a serious problem for this country. The level of the dollar has been affected, consumer confidence has been threatened and business confidence has been damaged. It is of serious concern to anybody who is interested in an objective sense in good government in this country that we may be headed down the path of the United States towards budgetary gridlock where hard decisions become almost impossible, lowest common denominator politics prevail and sectional interests inevitably dominate. I do not believe it is in the interests of either side of politics or in the interests of the country for that sort of outcome to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sort of outcome is the ultimate product of the notion of checks and balances, which is so dear to conservative political forces in this country, and which is enshrined in the institution of the Senate and in a variety of other political institutions in this country. Checks and balances really is a conservative code for constitutional impediments designed to prevent progressive governments from implementing policies which threaten powerful wealthy interests, even when those policies have popular support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look back only to 1974-75 to see that we needed a joint sitting of the parliament in order to introduce Medibank. This was in spite of the fact that that policy had been endorsed by the Australian people twice at an election, in 1972 and 1975, and in spite of the fact that it had the clear majority support in opinion polls&mdash;simply because the opportunity to use a so-called system of checks and balances presented itself to the representatives of the wealthy doctors and the private health funds to try to wreck a popular, progressive, well supported policy in the guise of Medibank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made those remarks, it is fair to say that there are one or two silver linings to the cloud. The first is that the opposition, by its behaviour, is actually bringing the notion of checks and balances and Senate powers into disrepute. There have been numerous examples quite appropriately cited by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in question time over the past few weeks of leading figures on the conservative side of politics, such as Malcolm Fraser, pointing to the inherent problems in this approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one who supports reform of the Senate and reduction of its powers, I say to the opposition, `Keep it up. You are doing a great job. Help us to discredit the excessive powers that are there in the Senate, which enable the Senate to effectively obviate the legislative program of a government which was elected to govern with an increased majority and an increased vote only seven or eight months ago'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also another aspect that is worth some brief comment. This is, I would trust, a non-partisan point but I think that the events we have witnessed recently actually throw some focus on the budget process itself, which I would suggest is now pretty much out of step with the requirements of administering an increasingly complex, modern, national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are numerous weaknesses in our process. We have the one big bang approach once a year which ensures that we have insufficient consideration of some of the major initiatives that end up being contained in the budget. The proposal with respect to optometry was a classic example of this, which has fortunately been abandoned. There is rigidity in dealing with the economy, creating occasionally a need for mini-budgets, May statements and the like, because the 12-month cycle is simply inappropriate. There is increasing difficulty in making accurate fiscal and economic projections, leading to a need for a regular revision of budget estimates. There is a need to concertina a vast array of fiscal issues into a single process within a specified timetable, and an entrenched bureaucratic straitjacket applying to government instrumentalities effectively impelling public servants to spend their budgets, whether efficiently or otherwise, by 30 June in order to ensure that they do not undermine their bid for the following year. This is an issue that we should be concerned about. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest that it is time for reconsideration of how we go about implementing fiscal policy in this country. It may be appropriate to consider, for example, separating out major fiscal initiatives, dealing with them separately and in an orderly fashion, making greater use of concepts such as rolling triennial funding and varied periods of program funding for specific initiatives rather than the assumption that they will automatically be refunded, and operating fiscal policy within a broader more multi-faceted and flexible framework which can be modified as demand arises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a certain almost monotony about my rising in the chamber to discuss the sales tax bills, monotony simply because the subject matter with which these bills deals has been in and out of this chamber on a number of occasions since 17 August. I am getting a little tired of saying the same thing over and over again to the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise tonight not because I want to bore you or bore the many listening people in the chamber but because the points being made by the opposition about tax equity and the wine industry need to be stated over and over again until the government finally gets the message that what it is proposing is totally unacceptable to the opposition and to the majority of grape growers. I represent a fair number of those grape growers and, like the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), I have been speaking to them and I know what they are saying. What they are saying does not reflect what the Australian Winemakers Federation has been signing on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up a couple of points that were made by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). He took this awfully uncomfortable, monopolistic view of all that is good, just and socially equitable emanating from the government benches, and all that is arid and cruel emanating from the opposition benches. Naturally, I find that a shade offensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that in his dissertation on the history of this parliament he did not go beyond March 1993 in accusing the opposition of having all sorts of dastardly policies in its briefcase marked Fightback. There is absolutely no evidence that any one of those policies has done any harm&mdash;after all, they have never been implemented. I would contend, as one who went around selling them, that there is no evidence that they would have done any harm had they been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had the honourable member for Melbourne in his enthusiasm to claim some sort of monopoly on all that is good been prepared to go back through the total history of this parliament he would have had to have recognised that human beings on both sides of this chamber have stood up and put the case for all Australians over and over again. My party, under former Prime Ministers, has nothing to apologise for in the way in which it has represented the needs of all Australians. In fact, history shows that there was a great deal more optimism in Australia, a great deal more sense of opportunity and a great deal more desire to work to achieve one's personal ends in the Menzies years, and this has been misrepresented by the honourable member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member for Melbourne claimed that we and the wine industry were crying wolf on the bills currently before the chamber&mdash;he said that we had done this in the past with things such as the fringe benefits tax&mdash;he was frankly failing to reflect what is happening right now in wine grape growing areas across Australia. He certainly failed to mention that former Prime Minister Hawke said to the growers in Griffith in 1983&mdash;and the honourable member for Riverina can attest to this more eloquently than I&mdash;`There will be no sales tax on wine'. The election in 1983 brought his party into government. It was just a nice convenient way to reassure people and to cultivate their votes. In 1983 the wine industry had no sales tax or excise impost on it at all. Who was in power from 1975 to 1983? It was the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the promise, it did not take long before that group opposite in 1984 introduced a 10 per cent sales tax on wine and, in 1986, a 20 per cent sales tax on wine. In an effort to reasonably represent the industry, coalition members did not oppose those tax measures. We were unhappy about them; we expressed all sorts of concerns about the impact that those tax measures would have on the industry; but, recognising that the wine industry could not remain a tax exempt alcoholic beverage industry, we went along with taxes that ultimately reached 20 per cent. I say that without apology. I say that in my electorate and the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) says it in his electorate. Between us, we dominate South Australia's wine grape growing areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we now face a tax hike of 55 per cent, as originally proposed, to take the tax from 20 per cent to 31 per cent. The government now seeks to bring that back to a temporary lull of 22 per cent and a target of 26 per cent, with a view to getting it to 31 per cent as quickly as possible once an industry inquiry has assessed whether or not the industry can afford to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I am speaking tonight on these bills because my stance is the same as it was on 18 August. Any move toward a tax on wine is one that will ultimately be carried not by the wine manufacturers but by the grape growers, the people on the end of the chain. There is no evidence that they can afford, or should be saddled with, an additional tax. I am opposed to the package currently before the House simply because a tax measure that was too severe on 18 August remains too severe on 19 October. Nothing has changed. If anything, the industry faces an even bleaker outlook post-budget than it did on budget night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we had in this debate? Government members have claimed the painfully obvious but, in doing so, have been wrong. They have claimed the painfully obvious point that this tax did not apply to exports. They have said that, since there is a growth in the export market, a tax ratcheted back to 26 per cent is defensible. That 26 per cent will not be borne directly by exports. It is true, exported wine will not pay it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But does anyone ever suppose that Australia's export industry is built solely on the fact that it is tax exempt? Australia's export industry is built on the fact that there is a viable, efficient and quality centred domestic industry which forms the foundation from which Australia can collect sufficient, high quality wine to send overseas to build its now enviable reputation. Yet the government, using this measure, proposes to effectively erode that domestic base on which these export sales have been built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the experience of any one of our major overseas competitors: all of them depend upon a viable and efficient domestic market in order to build their exports. The argument on tax equity does not stand up in light of what our competitors do to their wine industries. In Spain there is no equity between the tax levied on beer and spirits and the tax levied on wine. In France, Italy or any of the EC countries there is no equity, in pure dollar terms, between the tax levied on beer and spirits and the tax levied on wine. Why? Because the European producers recognise that the wine industry is quite different from the beer and spirits industries. They recognise the wine industry as one of which they are innately proud. We should be just as proud of our industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So our major European competitors have always had a government tax regime that favours wine over beer and spirits. They do it without apology. They do it because it is painfully obvious that, from putting a cutting in the vine, waiting four years before it bears anything like a crop and waiting eight years before it stops costing money, eight years are invested in that cutting before it starts making anything. Having taken the grapes from that cutting to the winery, in a quality market those grapes will not start bearing real sales for the producer until they are four or six years old. So there is an effective 12-year gap. There is no comparison between the wine industry and the brewing and spirits industries. If, as a parliament, we are serious about endeavouring to cultivate exports, we should encourage people to get on with the successful export business of producing quality Australian wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that has been said about tax equity needs to be set in the picture of what the industry pays in tax. Much has been made by the Winegrape Growers Council of Australia of its very commendable target of exporting $1 billion worth of product by the year 2000. The council is on track and it ought to be commended for that. But do honourable members realise that, had this government got away with hitting winegrowers with a 31 per cent impost&mdash;a rise of 55 per cent&mdash;this industry would have paid $2 billion in tax to the government by the year targeted for reaching $1 billion in export product? What does that say about tax equity and this government's target? From the government's point of view the industry has become nothing more than a tax revenue bowser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government might say, `There may be some validity in that, so we backed off to 26 per cent'. Even if the government held the tax rate at 26 per cent from 1996 through to the year 2000, we would still be looking at a tax bill that would nearly equate to the export income bill. That is hardly defensible. It certainly does not smack of a government desperately anxious to encourage this industry to get on with what the nation needs most: additional export income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In question time today, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) thought he would use a dear dorothy dix question to embarrass the opposition into in some way expediting the passage of the legislation before the House. We do not intend to be frustrated or embarrassed into action by the Minister for Finance. We intend to do what we think is in the long-term interest of Australian grape growers, who are principally represented on this side of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister effectively said that we were the ones who had frustrated the passage of this legislation. He said we had delayed the will of the Winemakers Federation and were therefore costing the Australian wine industry $2.3 million a day. That is total, refutable nonsense. The only reason why this legislation is in this chamber this afternoon is that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has failed to acknowledge what the parliament has told him. He has petulantly reintroduced the legislation. It is not the Liberal Party, the National Party of Australia, the Greens or the Australian Democrats, but the parliament which has said, `We will not pass a bill that includes a 31 per cent wine tax.' Any other Treasurer would have said, `I get the message. That part of the budget will not go ahead', and the uncertainty would have disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Melbourne implied that in some way the opposition was guilty of stopping the budget and frustrating the government's objectives. Would anyone listening to this debate know how many of the government's objectives have been frustrated by our decision to stop a 31 per cent tax on the wine industry? I calculate it at 0.07 per cent of the budget. The government expected this particular impost to raise a maximum amount of $70 million, which is half the amount of money that the Australian Labor Party proposed to frustrate in the 1981 budget when it used similar tactics on the then government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should we be apologetic for adopting a tactic this afternoon at only half the rate applied by the ALP? And the honourable member for Melbourne thinks we should somehow feel guilty for this action. In what we are proposing this afternoon, all we are doing is denying the government 0.07 per cent of the budget target it sought. We deny it in the interests of the viability of the total Australian wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you very patiently have heard me on a number of occasions make statements on behalf of the wine industry and reflect on the even greater inequity than the 31 per cent that is being felt by a winemaker in my electorate who makes de-alcoholised wines. Under this budget proposal, he faces a tax impost that takes his sales tax from 10 per cent to 21 per cent&mdash;an effective rise of 110 per cent. There is no justice in that. No-one on the government benches has attempted in any way to defend that absurd notion; yet I am told that the proposal from the government now is, having ratcheted back the wine tax from 31 per cent to an effective 26 per cent, to take the de-alcoholised wine tax back from 21 per cent to 16 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to take one Australian de-alcoholised wine producer who markets his wine at 0.5 per cent alcohol&mdash;it can be drunk until you become bloated and you still would not be inebriated&mdash;and force that producer to put his product on the shelf and compete with people who market grape juice whose effective sales tax regime will be 10 per cent while his will be 16 per cent. That is not just. He is not marketing into an alcoholic beverage market; he is marketing into a non-alcoholic beverage market. But no-one&mdash;not even the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay), for whom I have a high regard and who is at the table&mdash;has been prepared to take this up on behalf of the government and make the point to the minister and the Greens that here is a real inequity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is one Australian producer who will now face an effective shelf price rise in a market he has not predetermined and in a product that can be as beneficial as the product that it is marketed alongside of and who will now face a real price disadvantage because of the action of this government. His is a natural product made from Australian grapes, produced in my electorate in South Australia, and he is facing an effective disadvantage which has been completely ignored by the government. All that is ever said by the honourable member for Melbourne, and by other honourable members, about tax equity ought to be borne in light of that experience and the government's total incapacity to recognise the inequity that that producer currently faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Far from an industry currently enjoying a great deal of buoyancy, the simple truth for grape growers around Australia is that right now they are enjoying a marginal recovery from a very depressed situation. Mr Deputy Speaker, we have very short memories if we cannot remember that in 1984 when you and I were both very new members in this parliament the wine industry around Australia and the grape growers in particular were in straits so desperate that the government proposed a vine pull scheme to help them out of their difficulty. They were deeply in debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1990s, many of them have managed some sort of recovery, but none of them are enjoying the sorts of lifestyles that they ought to enjoy if they were to seek to make a return on the investment they have in grape growing. Much of that recovery has come as a result of their decision to retrellis and to move into new varieties which have long lead times, many of which they have only just started to harvest. Here we have an industry that is far from buoyant; an industry that is making a hesitant recovery. The government's reaction to this industry facing a hesitant recovery has been to hit it with a tax. At 31 per cent, 26 per cent or 22 per cent, the opposition contends that is grossly unfair. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said before in this place that, if we wanted to do something that really put the knocker on an industry that was about to contribute and has contributed substantially to this country, we would tax it in the way that this government has done&mdash;and not for very much money. Initially, the tax was going to produce about $79 million. After weeks of punitive negotiations&mdash;punitive for the people that have been involved in them&mdash;it now looks as though the tax may produce about $25 million a year net. So the deal that has been put together by various interests over time has come up with not too much for the government. But the government decided that it had to have a win. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My position on this matter is that to pick out the icon of Australian success and tax it is about as stupid a direction as one can move in. That is what the government managed to do, of course, without the knowledge of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). He knew about this tax at 6.30 on budget night. It was obviously a decision made in the interests of revenue raising without much forethought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some criticism of the opposition by the government that we have simply opposed for the sake of opposing. It is worth remembering what happened when this wine tax was first known about. The industry was quite horrified. The industry itself raced around and tried to put together&mdash;probably successfully; I am not aware of the exact figures&mdash;about $1 million to oppose this tax and to advertise in the media. The industry got great support. Very soon down the track some people decided to wobble. First, the Australian Democrats decided that they might look at some other arrangements and then other people were involved as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said many times before, it is difficult to hold a position when there are people who are supposed to be on one side&mdash;that is, on the side of the winegrowers, the winemakers and the people in the industry&mdash;already starting to wobble at the knees. Not only did the industry have the problem of a few weak sisters; it had the problem of the government deciding to put the gun to the head of the industry. The government put the industry on the excise rack and stretched the rack out for 12 months. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) and others rang up the leaders of the wine industry and said, `If you people don't do what we want you to do, we're going to introduce an excise and we're not going to put it through the parliament'. Everybody went to their lawyers to see how effective that would be. We have told them, `Of course, they'll threaten you with everything because these people operate like that. They won't take the view of the parliament or the view of the industry; they'll threaten you with something else'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said today that everyone is now in support of the government. A lot of people have become supporters in the end&mdash;reluctant debutantes&mdash;because the rack got stretched to the point where there was nothing else they could do. The government said to these people, `We will bring in an excise if you do not agree with what we are doing. We will not put it through for 12 months, and you can sweat. You can sweat, because everybody out there from the producer, to the wholesaler, to the retailer and the client will not know what the rate will be'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite proud to stand up here and say that I supported the wine industry in its initial stance. I talked to the industry, and I still support its initial stance. I am not so keen on the stance that it has taken now. We will vote against this legislation because, apart from anything else, that decision was not made by those people without pressure on them. It was not made under no duress. That decision was made because, as I said before, they were on the rack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth saying, at the same time, that if we had not had 36 votes in the Senate then the wine industry could not have negotiated at all. Nothing would have happened. The tax, originally at 31 per cent and eventually at 32 per cent, would have gone through. Everybody would have known that the wine industry was ripe for the picking. I say to people in the wine industry that they now know that, the next time a government contemplates a tax increase on their industry, it will not last for five weeks; it will probably last only 2 1/2 weeks before it capitulates. Maybe those people who were involved in undermining the original position, which I think was the right position that the Winemakers Federation took, will have time to reflect on exactly what they did to those industry leaders who, in effect, have finally come to another position. We will still vote against the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw the House's attention to one of the conditions that have become part of the deal that was done with the Winemakers Federation. What it wanted, in all of this time, was certainty. It kept saying to us, `This is a great worry to us. We are being threatened by Mr Brereton, we are being threatened by Mr Dawkins and we are being threatened by whoever happens to be negotiating, but we need certainty'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the proposals that the government has made in this whole arrangement&mdash;suggested by goodness knows who&mdash;is to have an Industry Commission hearing. The terms of that hearing included an examination of the industry and its potential to contribute to the Australian economy. I cannot imagine what genius thought that up. If we now need an Industry Commission hearing to tell us whether the wine industry is a potential contributor&mdash;not a contributor but it might, in the future, be a potential contributor&mdash;then we have lost our heads somewhere in the mire of this conundrum. We do not need that. Everybody knows that the wine industry is exactly the sort of business that we need in this country where we grow it, package it, design it, market it, send it to the other end of the world, compete against our best and historic competitors&mdash;the French&mdash;and knock them over in the marketplace. Nothing could be better. We do not need an examination of the industry, which will cost goodness knows how much, to find out whether this industry contributes to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter which will be considered by the commission is the appropriate form and level of taxation of wine beyond June 1996. Come back to the position that the industry has been putting to us&mdash;it is under pressure from the government and it needs certainty&mdash;and tell us where the certainty is after 1996. It seems patently obvious to me that the one thing that is absolutely certain is that nobody knows what the wine tax will be after 1996. Why? Because the government has formularised that uncertainty in this deal to have an Industry Commission hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last matter which will be considered by the commission is the timing and extent of any increases in cash grants to accompany any increases in taxation. So, on the one hand, the government says that it will find out whether the industry has any potential to contribute to the Australian economy; then it says that it will look at the form and level of taxation; and then it assumes that there will be some increases in taxation and finds out what the compensating cash grants can be ostensibly, I presume, for the smaller growers. Brilliant! It is an absolutely brilliant measure of how to formularise the one thing that people said was bugging their industry in this time of threat&mdash;threat by the federal government of carrying out excise measures which would bring to the industry even more doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During question time today the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) alluded to and the Minister for Finance read out a long list of supporters. He said that all the people in the industry have come alongside. I have said earlier that they have only come alongside because they were on the rack. A lot of people in this country have sent messages to us&mdash;and the same messages were sent to people like Mr Brian Croser&mdash;which say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please be assured that we in the wine industry appreciate you and your party's commitment to opposing the savage wine tax increase. We appreciate it greatly. Your support in time of need won't be forgotten.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that is the case, although things do tend to disappear out of mind quite quickly in these circumstances. Another letter suggests that support for the initial position taken by the Winemakers Federation was correct. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wine tax is still the incompetent, iniquitous and unfair law it always was. The only thing to have changed is the government's tactics. Using a divide, blackmail and conquer strategy, they have created a compromise which is not endorsed universally by the industry and has been accepted by duress by certain industry representatives who have been manipulated into a perceived position of weakness.</PARA>
<PARA>This correspondent actually saw through the threats of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). He said, `If Dawkins dares to try the excise path, let's meet him in the High Court or, still better, the polls. There are 3,500 liquor stores Australia wide and I, for one, am more than willing to start off a fund&mdash;$500 each should do it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I sadly note that the South Australian grape growers have capitulated. In the end they have come to some arrangement whereby they have reluctantly agreed that this tax should go ahead. I am disappointed because the vehemence with which that group of grape growers as a group, and with which individual grape growers in the Riverland, in the southeast of South Australia, and in other places opposed that tax was quite something to behold. They felt that they had also had people negotiating behind their backs. In fact, I think it is true to say that the first they heard about the last deal was at about 10.30 at night, after it had become public knowledge. Those South Australian grape growers were much offended by the fact that they were not informed of the deal. I confess with some sadness that the threats of the government finally coerced them also into collapsing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, if the government thinks that in the future we will buckle just because it uses all these methods of coercion it has another think coming.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bill we are addressing is the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. I would like to show my colleagues&mdash;and let all people know&mdash;the nature of the legislation we are going to deal with in an hour. This legislation will go through this House, largely without our having an opportunity to substantially address the very many questions that arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is designed to deal with a number of matters raised by the government during the election campaign. In 1993 it promised to introduce a mature age allowance and an earnings credit for people who receive jobsearch allowance, newstart or sickness benefits, in their various forms. That is interesting. These were substantial initiatives announced in an election campaign this year. The legislation deals with them. In the explanatory memorandum, a dozen or so other initiatives are listed, most of which we did not hear about in the election campaign, some of them designed to save substantial sums of money. Some of them are very much like the initiatives outlined in Fightback, in terms of their impact&mdash;severely criticised by the government because it was suggested that they would be unconscionably harsh on the most vulnerable people in the community, the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the euphemistic title `Budget initiatives', the implementation of measures to improve the effectiveness of the newstart allowance is mentioned. We should ask what it is. It involves a number of initiatives; I will not go through them all, because it would take up all the time I have. Under `Enhance compliance and review activity' it is stated that the Secretary to the Department of Social Security is being given the power to give very significant additional tests to people seeking newstart in particular&mdash;also the jobstart allowance&mdash;to require them to demonstrate activity and to enter into certain agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what does `activity' mean? It means evidence of activity designed to demonstrate that they are searching for employment. It gives the secretary to the department a discretion to require people to apply for advertised vacancies. It also extends the period that people who have fallen sick have to wait before they can go off jobsearch or newstart and pick up sickness benefits. Each of these initiatives is designed to save money. They will remove 20,000 people, according to the information provided by the department, from benefits that they now receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the organisations that offer advice in such matters say that under those proposals benefits are more likely to be taken from people who do not have a full English language capacity and do not understand all of the legal requirements, those who are handicapped, ill or&mdash;as my wife sometimes says&mdash;intellectually challenged. They are the sorts of people who are more likely to come off benefits through the required tests, so we are told by those who offer the government advice and assistance, the Welfare Rights Unit&mdash;an organisation the government sees fit to fund and assist, so it can offer helpful advice in relation to these matters. Yet the government largely ignores such advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is only one of a number of proposals in which this government has ambushed the community. It indicated one approach in the election campaign and developed another afterwards. One would have to be forgiven for thinking&mdash;given the complexity of the issues addressed&mdash;that the government did not have it in mind when the election was entered into, that there were not people in the Department of Social Security who said, `Minister, this would be an appropriate initiative'. Some minister, maybe one of those who were going from this place, knew of these initiatives and could have ensured that the public knew of these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the only such proposal. When we go through the legislation we find other titles in this bill. I want to refer to one which brings out very clearly that the government is going to make changes to the provision of compensation. It says it will introduce a number of measures `to preserve the integrity and effectiveness' of the compensation provisions in the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is seeking to implement a new statutory divisor to exclude claimants for eligibility for benefits for longer periods than they might now otherwise be excluded. How does it operate? The government has sought to develop a new formula by which people who receive compensation claims in a lump sum, either by a settlement or as a result of some litigation, are required to spend at least half on maintenance before they can claim a benefit. That is what the government is providing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now changing the formula by which that accounting calculation is undertaken. At the moment it uses the all-male figure in average weekly earnings&mdash;$612.50 per week. But it is going to substitute&mdash;some might say because it wants to be more gender pure&mdash;the average weekly earnings, or person index, which is $517.50 per week. It does not take much imagination to understand that if the amount received is divided by the larger sum, the all-male figure, the money would be used up more quickly. But if it is divided by the smaller amount, people are excluded from benefits for a longer time. That is very clever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication is that the government saves further sums of money. In relation to that provision, we are told it will be $31.8 million in 1995-96. But it does not stop there. Over the page in the explanatory memorandum is a provision which is described in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . all secondary school students born after 31 December 1977, apart from those students who attract AUSTUDY paid at the independent or away from home rate or who are homeless, will remain within the social security system until they turn 17. Most students will become eligible to attract the Family Payment for their care giver. On their 17th birthday, secondary school students will be able to claim AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What are the implications of that provision? It seems to be a rather nice provision. One would not think that it had any particular implications in terms of saving the government revenue&mdash;but it does; it saves $24.5 million in 1995-96. How does it do so? It does it very simply: of the order of 62,400 students will be affected by this measure in 1994, and 135,000 will be affected when it is fully implemented by 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the vagaries of the system, some people&mdash;I note that it is only some&mdash;will receive a little more. But in the main most of them will receive a lower rate of benefit. How does that occur? It occurs very simply. If a person is receiving the Austudy allowance today, that person will be receiving $129.80 per fortnight, but if the government takes that person off Austudy that person receives the additional family allowance of $121.60 per fortnight&mdash;a difference of $8.20 per fortnight. So there will be a saving of $8.20 per fortnight this year for something like 62,400 individuals. That is what is involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also applies different income tests. For Austudy, the test takes into account the maximum income in the family situation of $30,000. For the additional family payment, the maximum income test is $24,169 if the family owns its own home. The legislation applies a different assets test value. In relation to Austudy the test is $367,150, and for the additional family payment it is $363,500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the government doing this because it is a better way under the welfare system rather than the Austudy system of paying students while they are at school? Or is it, as I think, that it is really just another smart measure for saving additional money? I want to make it very clear that I do not regard measures like that as smart when they could have been foreshadowed as expenditure savings in an election campaign, where people were honestly expressing their views as to what ought to happen in the future; where people could make up their minds as to whether they wanted to vote for the government when it had these particular proposals in mind and contrast them with other proposals that other parties may have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are words that we are not allowed to use in this place that describe people who put forward policies and programs disguising their real intention in the way in which this government did. It is not at all worthy of the government, and it is proper that people understand what is involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other major steps involved in this legislation. We are not going to oppose most of them because they are part of the government's budget. On the expenditure side, the question as to whether one ought to be knocking off expenditure saving initiatives is very vexed, and one which has to be looked at seriously in the wider context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some proposals in the legislation that involve additional expenditure. One of those relates to, particularly, the issue of young people who might be living away from home in a homeless situation, or receiving the independent rate of jobsearch allowance or sickness allowance. The government intends a new initiative involving additional expenditure, and that is the abolition of the waiting period for rent assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it very clear to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) that we are not opposing it, but he is on wood in relation to this matter between now and when this legislation is finally dealt with in the Senate. Last week he made statements on radio in Brisbane in which he foreshadowed that certain reviews are likely to be undertaken departmentally on the provision of young homeless allowance support. The parliamentary secretary would also be aware that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has been considering a proposal from me, which has been before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, for a thorough parliamentary review into the way that youth homeless allowances are dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know nothing of the vague proposal that the parliamentary secretary referred to on air and I think the parliament is entitled to hear from the parliamentary secretary, or to hear in another place, exactly what the government has in mind. I draw the parliamentary secretary's attention to my statement on that matter, because I think those questions need to be clarified. The opposition believes that there needs to be a thorough open public inquiry on this matter, not because we believe that it is inappropriate to support some young people by additional benefits&mdash;particularly if they are abused and particularly if they are at risk at home&mdash;but because we are concerned that the 10,000 benefits in this area now being paid might well be quite inappropriate in a number of cases. That is a matter that needs to be the subject of a full and complete inquiry. Before this matter is finally dealt with, we require some clarification on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some very serious issues on the compensation question have been raised by people who are interested not only in the savings aspect but also in the broader question which has been dealt with in the past relating to litigated compensation claims. It is a question of whether where matters are settled we should move to a situation in which 50 per cent of a settlement is treated as an amount payable for loss of income. I have been told by the parliamentary secretary's advisers that in many of the litigated matters it is believed that people, by having to accept that 50 per cent of anything they receive is deemed to be for income loss, might be in an advantageous position because in a settlement situation it might have been agreed that the amount should have been larger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may well be cases&mdash;I have had some drawn to my attention&mdash;where a beneficiary or a pensioner receives a settlement after having been involved in a motor vehicle accident or another situation of like character. That person is deemed to have received compensation for lost earnings, even though his only income was a pension. Some of the money received for pain and suffering or for medical expenses was to be used for the person's maintenance before he was eligible for a benefit or eligible to continue to receive a benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other major questions have been raised by members of the legal profession, but time does not permit me to put them all on the record tonight. I foreshadow that we will be moving in another place that this issue be the subject of a full inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitution Affairs. We think that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also foreshadow that we will be moving&mdash;it will be part of my motion tonight but will also be moved in another place&mdash;to have the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training undertake a review of the question of the Austudy payments now being made under the family support arrangements. These are important steps that we will take because we believe that in a complex piece of legislation of this sort we need to have a thorough inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take the time of the House to deal with two other matters which are raised in this legislation and which I think call for a good deal of comment. I am sure the parliamentary secretary would not be surprised to hear me adverting to them. I refer again to the explanatory memorandum because it enables us to see the way in which those who have to dress these things up for the government manage to develop some euphemisms which characterise them in quite a different way from their actual impact. One of those to which I wanted to draw the attention of the House is under the title `Minor policy changes'. What do we mean by minor policy changes? The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Make it clear that it is enough for the Department's notices to comply with the statutory requirements set out in the Social Security Act 1991 even where the notices omit specification of the manner of compliance and do not describe themselves as recipient notification or statement notice.</PARA>
<PARA>What is all of that about? It is about the government having failed the Australian taxpayer grievously and this parliament being asked to overturn a major principle in relation to legislation. We are being asked to validate the issue of certain notices that have been given over time. If we go back for a period of five years, the explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will be retrospective to 1 January 1988 . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We are being asked to validate the issue of certain notices that, if they were not valid, would put at risk the Commonwealth's entitlement to reclaim from certain beneficiaries amounts as high as $250 million accumulated as social security debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the administration of the Department of Social Security under this government, this parliament is being asked to validate notices that in law&mdash;the government has been told by courts and tribunals&mdash;were defective in giving to pensioners and beneficiaries notice of the department's requirement to tell it of certain changes in their circumstance. The law says, `If you don't give people adequate notice in this form, the debt does not arise'. The government failed to give notice in the form required under the law; that is what happened. The government has known since 1991 that these notices were defective, because that is when tribunals started overturning some of the claims. The government has allowed this situation to go on until $250 million is involved. This makes the bottom-of-the-harbour tax scandal look something of a minor consequence. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take the opportunity to refer to one more of the myriad of matters that one could have raised in relation to this legislation. It deals with the provisions&mdash;again regarded by this government as being of perhaps little significance&mdash;to continue data matching and to make some other minor amendments to the Data-Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990. When the provisions were introduced to allow the Department of Social Security to match its data with data held by other government departments and to use the tax file number system, there was a great deal of concern on this side of the House that it would need very good reasons to be able to embark upon such an endeavour. To ensure adequate review of these arrangements, there was a requirement that the department report to parliament on a regular basis and that the department, in relation to the operation of these provisions, be subjected to a sunset clause&mdash;that is, the act would include a sunset clause which would bring these provisions to an end unless their continued existence could be justified. When the government sought to justify these particular provisions, it told us that there were substantial savings to the government in terms of apprehending fraud against the social security system if it were able to data match and if data matching were to be part of its fraud control system. The government told us in 1992-93 that it would be able to save $300 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that we have a report tabled today. We have not had a great deal of time to study it, but in chapter 10 there are some very interesting observations. Those observations confirm what we were told in the estimates committees in another place&mdash;that the $300 million has evaporated, and the best the government could do was save $70 million. The government also tells us that the amounts that were expected to be saved in future years are also evaporating. The government then sought to justify it, to give us reasons. I thought this was lovely. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes in economic circumstances are an important factor in why the original estimate has not been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the department tells us. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1989-90 the economy was more buoyant, family incomes and interest rates were higher and work was easier to obtain.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, I suppose, we are entitled to deduce that more people wanted to cheat. That is what we are able to deduce, I suppose, from those comments. The report goes on to tell us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another key factor in not achieving the original estimate is the interaction of the Data-matching Program with other compliance measures.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to talk about voluntary compliance. The government wants us to believe that more people are doing the right thing, and then the report tells us that it makes that assumption because there are indications&mdash;I do not know what those indications are&mdash;that the awareness in the community about the tax file number requirement and other uses to which numbers are put has been prompted by this data matching requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the opposition is concerned, there is no way that we will agree to the sunset clause being removed in its entirety. We will be moving in another place that it be extended for a further two years and the reporting requirements be extended for another two years. It may be that this report gives some justification, although I find it questionable. Quite frankly, I cannot understand why other important reports associated with this matter are still outstanding. Why is it that we can table reports from the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of Social Security&mdash;all of those departments today&mdash;but the report of the Auditor-General has been postponed until 26 October? I wonder why. Maybe the parliamentary secretary can enlighten us. But I suspect it says a lot more about the data matching program than we know at the moment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief and will allow my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) to enlighten the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) on some of the more positive aspects of the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill, because there are a great number of positive aspects. I think it is incredibly sad that the honourable member has chosen to focus on all the wrong things. He has also compared it to Fightback. Under Fightback the coalition was going to take people off the dole after nine months. We are providing more committed case work for people on newstart. If that is interpreted as leaving the sick and the non-English speaking people in the cold, I think he has read it very wrongly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will focus very briefly on some of those issues that affect particularly young people. The first of those is allowing payment of the jobsearch and newstart allowances to continue where a course of study of less than six months is commenced as part of an activity test or agreement. Again this is about continuity, it is about creating jobs and it is about cutting down on the bureaucratic burden. The bill allows for easier transition from the jobsearch allowance and the newstart allowance to Austudy and Abstudy, and it is about creating jobs. The introduction from January next year of a $200 education entry payment for jobsearch and newstart allowance clients under 18 is again about creating jobs and training and is for the benefit of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly interested in what the honourable member for Berowra has said about the homeless youth allowance. I am also a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has asked us to investigate all aspects of homeless youth&mdash;not just whether some people are getting this payment wrongly&mdash;and to look into the causes of homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I  have worked in a voluntary capacity for some time in a program for homeless youth and I can tell you some of the distress that you will find there. If the honourable member for Berowra cares to go around Kings Cross and look in the refuges and some of the places that these young people find themselves in, he will see that people do not leave home just to get money, which has been the reason publicised in a lot of the newspapers. I suspect the honourable member has picked up that theme. Those people need all the help they can get, and I think it is up to us to look at the causes of homelessness in order to cut down on the number of people needing that homeless allowance. We need to look at causes in order to help those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the honourable member also referred to removing Austudy from 16-year-olds and replacing it with family payments. I have a few examples here to tell honourable members about. A sole parent with one student child will be better off by $95.60 a fortnight and will also benefit from the sole parent tax rebate of $1,166 a year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill under consideration this evening the government's guiding principle seems to be that less is more. As a result of its decision to move eligible 16-year-olds in secondary education from Austudy to the social security net of family payments, thousands of Australian families who are already battling an economic depression are actually worse off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training, around 64,000 students from some 62,000 families will be affected next year and, when the system is fully implemented in 1995, this figure will be 135,000 students from some 126,000 families. It is calculated that 75 per cent of families will then be worse off than if the current system was continued. I am surprised that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm), was implying that somehow most people who would qualify at the present time would be better off under this new system. The reality is that only very few will be better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government expects to save $4.4 million in 1993-94, rising to $26.9 million in 1996-97 as a result of this measure. The key to this saving is the way in which this measure reduces or tightens up the eligibility for Austudy. The income test and assets test thresholds for additional family payments are lower than they are currently for 16-year-olds under Austudy. The income limit&mdash;about $24,000 compared to the current amount of $30,000 for Austudy&mdash;is significant enough to disqualify needy families and students who, at the present time, receive assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to the difference in the assets threshold for additional family payments and Austudy, we can see where the greatest disparity between the two systems lies. While Austudy took into account only 50 per cent of the assets of a business or farm in which a family is substantially engaged, so actually doubling the assets limit to some $734,000, the social security system does not acknowledge the problems of the cash poor, asset rich situation of many struggling country people. For many it may be a difference of only $8 a fortnight in terms of payments&mdash;honourable members may say that is not an enormous amount&mdash;but this adds up to $200 a year, and $200 is not an inconsiderable amount in the budget of struggling families. It can certainly buy a few school books and perhaps finance the odd excursion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government tells us that everyone will get the basic family payment, which is around $10 a week. This will be the fate of 3,700 students next year and 7,900 students the year after who otherwise would have received Austudy. It is not enough that these days country people have to battle fire, flood, poor harvests and low prices at market; they now have to battle a callous and uncaring government whose largess is all for its trade union mates in the cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some the financial loss will be considerable due to this measure. Jan Sneyde, Chairperson of the Upper and Mid North Rural Justice Committee in South Australia, has calculated that a family with four children aged 18, 16, 14 and 10 years and with a taxable income of $28,500 would effectively lose $2,831 in government assistance over the course of a year, or $54.45 a week. Where is the justice in slugging the country people harder in such bleak times?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be said that Austudy has not been the success story that the government has claimed. A report by Bruce Chapman last year concluded that there was no compelling evidence that significant numbers of the most disadvantaged who wished to continue their education had done so. He said that this is because the level of support offered is insufficient to have a real effect on post-secondary education choices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth support for students has existed since just after the end of the Second World War. But under this Labor government the coverage of students has decreased dramatically while the level of support has remained the same in real terms. Over 70 per cent of tertiary students received government assistance in 1976. In 1990, 41.3 per cent of full-time students received Austudy. Around half received nothing at all from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has chosen to go the way of loans for many students. These have the effect of ensuring that those who are in most financial need now will end up having to pay back the most. Recently Doris, a single mother who was trying to improve her chances in the job market by doing a business course at a TAFE, approached my office after receiving no joy from the office of the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). In dire financial need, she had opted for what she thought was a part loan and, due to mistakes made by the Commonwealth Bank in losing her application form and lodging it late, she ended up receiving small and irregular payments. She then had no money to pay for books and materials for the course and was receiving notices about debts owing to DEET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Doris, in fact, unbeknownst to her, had had her entire Austudy traded in for a loan which has to be repaid eventually. She also had not been given any information as to how much she owed. She advises all she knows now not to take on the loan. The bureaucracy has a siege mentality as regards its clients and does more to obfuscate and obstruct those like Doris who simply want some help in their lives and with their studies. As Doris says, the loans or Austudy supplements give people a taste for some extra money but then catapults them into debt. It is estimated that, by the age of 50, 90 per cent of male students and only 70 per cent of female students will have repaid their loans. I wonder what sort of poverty trap we are creating, particularly for female students, whereby only 70 per cent of them by the age of 50 will have repaid these loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of equity used by Chapman is that equality of opportunity is assumed to be satisfied when people with similar motivations and abilities experience similar educational outcomes; in other words, that no barriers exist to educational access and that factors such as race, sex, or parental income do not restrict individual choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simplistic belief of this Labor government has always been that it is only a lack of finance which prevents people from participating in education. Yet all the research indicates the overwhelming importance of non-economic factors in the education decision. Variations in family income explain only a quarter of the differences in decisions between individuals in the United States of America, for example. In Australia, it is reckoned that Austudy has encouraged about 15 per cent of full-time disadvantaged students to enrol in higher education who otherwise would not have done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more important are parental encouragement and expectations, parents' education, and race and sex. So important are expectations and encouragement by the family that having a non-English speaking background represents a significant advantage over having a male parent, born in Australia or outside Australia, in an English speaking country. This is because new migrants have a powerful ambition to succeed in their new country against all the odds and in addition to this they usually have a strong work ethic. The same goes for secondary education&mdash;encouragement by families is the key factor in predicting completion of secondary school. This is why an education system founded on encouragement of the most able is the only way to a healthy economy. Instead we have developed a culture which the Americans have termed `dumbing down', not encouraging our students to compete hard except in sport. In order to promote a more skilled, intelligent work force, we have to begin by setting expectations high for all our children from their various backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These budget proposals and their implementation through this bill exposes a degree of cynicism and hypocrisy on the part of the government. During the election campaign, government members at university campuses and educational institutions across Australia attacked the opposition for suggesting changes to student assistance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, I want, firstly, to take exception to the remarks made earlier by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). He is a long serving member of the parliament and he knows the forms very well. I am sure that his error was well intentioned. He referred to matters which are before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs. A reference has been sent to the minister seeking an inquiry on the youth homeless allowances. He knows as well as I do that it is not appropriate to refer to matters that are before a committee, even though they were raised and the committee accepted the intent. It is not appropriate for him to canvass such matters. I think he does himself no good by acting in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle of parliamentary committees is quite fundamental. I have served on many and on all of them members have always tried to take a bipartisan view. By introducing that particular topic into the debate I am apprehensive that the honourable member may have prejudiced that particular issue, and I think that is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it interesting that this legislation, which is so comprehensive and is an omnibus of amendments to the act, has an amendment relating to Austudy. The whole speech of the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) was devoted to Austudy, which made us think that this was an Austudy bill. What is it about? It is about the transfer of 16-year-old secondary students from Austudy to the family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that those who are listening to this broadcast must be thoroughly confused as to why Austudy has been referred to in such detail. We have been lectured, hectored and harangued for weeks about the limitation of debate. We have been abused from pillar to post about guillotines and curtailment and the honourable member for Menzies used the time allotted to him to speak about Austudy. This is the kind of hypocrisy and trivialisation that we have seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have enjoyed the last few weeks of parliament. The Senate may well have done us all a great favour by its decision about when to accept legislation from the House of Representatives. This last few weeks of parliament without MPIs and censure motions has been enormously productive. There has been more time to debate legislation every day and more legislation has been canvassed and argued than I have seen in my 10 years of experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who think it is important to debate issues before the parliament and to pass legislation which has been given thought and at least some constructive appraisal are finding it very positive. Members of the opposition complain bitterly. There have been two opposition speakers on this bill. The first speaker acted in a way which is not appropriate for his position; the second speaker spent his time speaking about Austudy. That gives an indication of what this opposition is about. The opposition is not interested in social security or Austudy, it is interested in cheap point scoring and trivia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are quite extensive. I suppose I should put it in context. In the last 10 years of this government we have seen the most dramatic reforms in the social security system that this country has ever seen. I can recall what the legislation was like when we first came into office. Pensioners who earned more than $3 a week in one particular year paid tax on everything over $3. I remember when the earnings provisions were changed at the whim of the government every five or six years. No-one ever knew. It was never planned and it was never predictable. The taxation levels were fluid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we first came into office, I recall that the rental assistance&mdash;which is being improved even further by this legislation&mdash;was $5 a week, but for every $1 earned, $1 of rental allowance was lost. So anybody on an income of at least $5 a week got no rental allowance. Five dollars a week in rental allowance was taxed totally, dollar for dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These legislative changes are further refinements, but now every single aspect of social security is indexed. There is annual indexation of assets and of earning capacity, which encompasses taxation. We have brought household incomes together for taxation, as they are for pensions, which was a massively complex change that set a pattern which is enormously important. All of those things have been done. Income free areas and tax free areas have been synchronised and indexed. All of these things have been done, but opposition members spend all of their time talking about one small amendment in relation to Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centrepiece of these amendments is the mature age allowance, and it is a major piece of social support. A male aged 60 years or over&mdash;women of 60 years have pension rights now&mdash;who has been unemployed for a year or more and registered as such can now effectively take a voluntary pension. Not just in Australia but around the world, as people get older, if they lose their jobs, through restructuring, through retrenchments or for whatever reason, they tend to find it very difficult to either get re-skilled or find alternative work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in such a position will now have the choice of retirement. From 20 March 1994 such people will no longer have to go through the indignity of applying for jobs and submitting themselves to the department, even on a quarterly basis, and filling in the forms. I would have thought that would have at least rated some vague mention by the opposition. This matter was raised during the election campaign. One would have thought that any fair-minded opposition member would not have been able to ignore that and would have at least referred to it; but that has not happened. Opposition members have spent half their time talking about stuff they should not be talking about&mdash;matters which are the property of a committee&mdash;and the other half talking about Austudy and the social security amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mature age allowance is a major change which will free many people from the embarrassment and the indignity of spending four or five years reporting and applying for positions. The critical aspect of it is that it is voluntary&mdash;this is not an attempt to force people into retrenchments or into retirement. No employer should attempt to use this provision to displace older employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past 10 years there has been a dramatic change in relations between the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training. When I was first elected to parliament 10 years ago, these two departments never spoke to each other. They never communicated and they never exchanged information. I recall the middle 1980s when we started to recognise the problems caused by that lack of communication. In my area the two departments were required to cross-check their records. In those days, of the people registered for unemployment benefits, one in five was not registered for work. Entirely separate records were kept in separate departments. Nowadays with jobsearch and newstart, these two departments work very closely together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initiatives were brought forward in the last budget for innovative changes whereby those two departments could come together more productively and more creatively, which is reflected in these amendments. So we are seeing the government work as a government. We no longer see separate departments working against each other, which I fought so bitterly against back in the middle 1980s, particularly during the John Howard recession of 1983-84 which had tragic effects in the area I represent. Importantly, the newstart and jobstart programs provide support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation, the allowance is allowed to accumulate and build up credits against income. Again, this is one of these enormously symbolic changes which affect some people. People can earn a large amount in a small time, which can really affect their support. So the idea of being able to build up and use credits is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The newstart implementation program required a report for the 1993-94 budget. I echo the support of the relevant minister in putting this forward. That report indicated that, of the 1.7 million referrals in the period, 430,000 had been placed on the labour market programs with 320,000 as job placements. In the Newcastle area that I represent, there has been a quite dramatic placement of long-term unemployed. We have figures, in some cases, of over 50 per cent and, for the longer term unemployed, the figures are between 30 per cent and 40 per cent. Six months after having used one of the support programs such as jobstart, 30 per cent to 40 per cent of those still in employment had previously been long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government made it very clear in the budget that this recovery is not simply about jobs. It is about ensuring that people who suffer the most during the recession are able to recover as well. We do not want people left behind as in the UK and some other countries, certainly America, where people get sidetracked, shunted off and left to rot and fester for the rest of their lives. That must not happen, and these amendments in fact help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall programs to support the long-term unemployed, both through training and financial support, are vital. We do not hear much about those programs because the opposition pretends that they do not exist. However, as parliamentarians, opposition members use those programs all the time. If one goes around the countryside and asks people in the skillshare schemes what the Liberal Party is doing, those people reply, `They're terrific. They use us all the time. They are constantly referring people to us'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one asks the CES whether the Liberal Party parliamentarians are supportive of LEAP, one is told, `Of course they are supportive'. But that is not the case publicly. Publicly, those programs do not exist. The tragedy of this situation is that the only ones who know about the programs are the people these parliamentarians speak to. As parliamentarians, these Liberal members are telling only the people they know. In other words, the broad bulk of people are not being told by their representatives what is available for them. It is appalling and hypocritical that members of the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia are refusing to campaign publicly in support of skillshare, LEAP, jobstart, jobskill and all such programs. Anyone involved in any of these programs around Australia who is represented by either a Liberal or National Party member will say that his or her federal member refers people to those programs, but not publicly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bills being debated cognately here are the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill 1993 and the Overseas Students Tuition Assurance Levy Bill 1993. I wish to state at the outset that because there are certain constraints on these bills tonight&mdash;we are under guillotine and therefore limited in time&mdash;this may well affect the procedure at the end of this cognate second reading debate. The opposition wishes to move amendments during the committee stage, and therefore will seek to ensure there is a committee stage for both of these bills, as well as to vote against a clause in one of the bills. Time is going to be of the essence, which will mean that certain aspects of the debate must necessarily be truncated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These bills seek to tighten up on provisions that presently apply to students who come to Australia from overseas to purchase education services. Some legislation was passed in this House in 1991. It was considered by a Senate committee, as a consequence of which a number of amendments were passed to the act as it now exists. Those amendments were intended to loosen up the legislation. The original bill was considered to be overly restrictive and bureaucratic and the government therefore accepted a number of amendments as recommended in the Senate committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interim, last year there was the failure of a business college in Perth, which meant that the Commonwealth government had a moral obligation to pick up a liability of $2.2 million. It is very bad for Australia, as one of the countries in the world market of education services, to have a situation where students from overseas pay in advance to do courses here&mdash;the money goes to the college or institution concerned&mdash;if that institution then goes bankrupt, the money is no longer available. So some sort of assurance must be given to those wishing to come to Australia to purchase educational services, whether they be post-secondary, specialised or tertiary courses, that the money they have paid means that they will actually get a course in which they wish to be enrolled. That is the essential purpose of the legislation before us tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the coalition has a number of quite profound difficulties with the legislation before us. The government has commissioned a consultant's report on this subject. It is our information that that report will probably be received by the government at the end of this month. Nevertheless, these bills have come into the House and, to a large extent, they pre-empt the consultant's report. None of us know what will be in that report, nevertheless, the Department of Employment, Education and Training has put forward in those bills some schemes which are quite far reaching in their effect. It is the coalition's view that these bills should not have been brought forward until the contents of that consultant's report were known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have before us, in the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill, some proposals that will have a profound impact on service providers and which are very important to the students. However, we do not actually know the form these proposed changes will take because the substance of them, we are told, will be provided in subsequent regulations. This parliament has, on a number of occasions, taken a quite tough line on that sort of procedure by a government. It is accepted that on many occasions certain aspects of legislation need to be in regulation. It is not accepted that actual policy can be in regulation. Parliament has taken exception to quite a number of examples of this sort of legislation, the most noteworthy being the Migration Act 1989 where the immigration system was rewritten. We were asked to enact legislation without knowing anything of the details of the form the new migration system was to take. On that occasion, the parliament saw fit to put a sunset clause on the bill. It passed the bill so that the government could go ahead with setting up its structures, but it said, `If we are not satisfied with the regulations, if we are not satisfied with the final impact of this legislation, then this act will lapse on a certain date'. The opposition takes a very similar view on the bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the actual issues? A number of things happened in what has been referred to as the ESOS Amendment Bill. First of all, an overseas student is redefined as a person holding a student visa. I will ask a question just in passing; it is not one I am going to dwell on but I think it is a point that will be worth spending some more time on at a time in the future. I ask the question: how does this affect New Zealand students? New Zealand students of course come here without a visa. Does that mean that New Zealand students can enter this country in order to study and not have the same sorts of imposts put on them as those which are put on overseas students; namely, overseas students who go to, let us say, one of our universities have to pay full fees? They do not pay HECS. I think that is worth clarifying. Does this mean that New Zealand students, who will not be classified as overseas students because of this new definition of overseas students, will therefore be able to come here to study, study at the cost of HECS and then go back to their country? In that case, of course, the government has no recourse to the balance of fees which would be payable by all other overseas students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills' most important issues are the establishment of trust accounts for the money that is received for tuition&mdash;money paid in advance with certain draw-down provisions&mdash;and the requirement that a provider of education services must be a member of a tuition assurance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to deal with the matter of trust accounts first. The coalition's communications with the industry and its providers reveal that they are not convinced that trust accounts are necessary. However, part of the difficulty in considering this proposal is that clause 5 of this bill, which provides for a new section 6A in the act, leaves the substantial aspects of the trust accounts again to be detailed in regulations. The point at issue here, and the debate within the industry and between the industry and government, is subsection (2), which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A provider must not withdraw or pay money out of a notified trust account except as permitted by the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>It is of course the withdrawal and payment of money which is the central issue of this trust account. It is one thing to set up a trust account; access by the educational provider to the money in that trust account is another. They need access to an amount of the money in advance in order to proceed with the course. Subsection (5) of that proposed new section 6A states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations may make provision for or in relation to exempting providers from the requirements of this section.</PARA>
<PARA>That is probably&mdash;I say `probably', I do not know for sure&mdash;not as significant a section to the industry as the previous one certainly is. Therefore, the coalition is saying that the providers and this parliament are entitled to know what is being proposed there before being asked to put this impost on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other aspect is that it has been stated to the opposition&mdash;and I am sure to the government too&mdash;that the proposed commencement date for all of this is not a convenient or practical one. In fact, it will be a very expensive one for the industry. The government, according to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) in his second reading speech, wants to get these schemes operating early next year. The request has come from industry for the implementation of these accounts to be from the beginning of the next financial year, namely, 1 July 1994. There will be quite some expense to service providers in setting up the trust accounts. It will be very awkward indeed for them to be setting up trust accounts some fraction of the way&mdash;and it certainly will not be exactly half&mdash;through the financial year. If they were given the opportunity to have the trust accounts set up to start functioning as from the beginning of their normal financial year, it would not be so expensive and difficult a scheme to administer. I think that is a very reasonable proposal, and I recommend to the government that it follow that procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having dealt with that, we come to the substance of the bills which are causing the most difficulty. These bills were introduced into parliament a couple of weeks ago. The last week in which we sat&mdash;namely, the week before last&mdash;I contacted the main organisations that are involved in this area and asked them for comment. These two main organisations are the Australian Association of Institutions Accredited to Teach English Language Intensive Courses to Overseas Students&mdash;known as ELICOS&mdash;and the Australian Council for Private Education and Training, which is known as ACPET. I contacted a number of other organisations too, and, significantly, the other educational institution which is fairly uniquely affected by this bill is Bond University. Government funded universities will be exempt from the provisions of the bill but Bond University, as a private university, will not be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the views of those peak organisations and of Bond University are significant because they are the ones which will have to live with these provisions and have to foot the bill. Their reaction when I contacted them in relation to these bills to get their views was very interesting indeed. Opposition members had been briefed by DEET, and we are grateful to the minister for having made that briefing so freely available. But out of that briefing we were led to believe&mdash;and we came out of the briefing believing&mdash;that industry had been fully consulted on these changes that were about to take place and that there would be no surprises. In fact, we were told that industry understood them and went along with them. However, that is not the case at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a system of consultation. A working party with representatives of government and industry has discussed these matters and considered them together, but the government did not inform the organisations in the industry when it was about to introduce these bills into parliament. In fact, they were quite unaware of the existence of the bills until I contacted them. The organisations were shocked by their contents because the contents are not what they had been given to understand the government was working towards. The reaction was very sharp indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to put that down to indicate&mdash;in case anybody else has this misapprehension&mdash;that we certainly got an impression in our communication with DEET which was not right. There was an impression very definitely given to service providers by DEET which was not right. There is now quite a degree of difficulty in this area because of that. That is interesting when one notes that, as I do, in correspondence that has since been received from ELICOS and ACPET, they hold the view that the measures such as the trust account would not be necessary if DEET were doing the job that it is supposed to be doing under the present act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DEET informed us that it was doing this job; it was doing the monitoring of accounts but that was not sufficient and it needed more power than that over these moneys. It needed more legislative power. The industry tells us that DEET is not monitoring and in fact, if it were, there probably would not be a problem. That is a very serious accusation to make. As consultations have proceeded on this subject, and as more and more aspects and dispute have emerged, it has led me to wonder whether in fact the essential problem in this area that the legislation is trying to address or claims to address would not exist if DEET were doing its job properly. In fact, it leads me to wonder whether we have here an excuse for the department to exercise more control over the industry, by using something that it blames the industry for, when it is itself to blame for the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming now to the point of this tuition assurance scheme: it will require that a provider of education for overseas students be a member and pay a levy&mdash;a financial impost. This tuition assurance scheme will also be set up under regulations. We are going to say to these education institutions that they may not offer courses of education to overseas students unless they are registered providers under the act. So whoever has the power over deciding whether bodies are registered in the first place&mdash;or, alternatively, if once registered whether they are to lose that registration&mdash;has the power of life and death over the very existence of an institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told nothing at all about how this registration scheme is to be established or what the criteria for registration are. What will the provider have to show, to whoever makes these decisions, about whether they are registered or deregistered?  Will they have any rights of appeal? There is nothing said about that. In section 8 of this bill, which will provide a new section 7A in the act, all we have are a dozen or so lines which say that all of this will be done under regulation. The new section 7A reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7A.(1) After the end of 2 months after the commencement of this section, a provider must at all times:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)be a member of a tuition assurance scheme established in accordance with the regulations; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)comply with the rules of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>Full stop. Further subsections read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) A provider who is not a member of a tuition assurance scheme as required by subsection (1) contravenes that subsection even though the reason for not being a member is that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the provider's application for membership was rejected; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)the provider's membership of a scheme has been cancelled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The regulations may make provision for or in relation to exempting providers from the requirements of this section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) In this section:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">`tuition assurance scheme'</EMPHASIS> means a scheme whose main objects include ensuring that overseas students receive the education or training for which they have paid.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it is quite unexceptional that its objects include that they must provide that. But what other objects of the tuition assurance scheme are there? I repeat the definition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">`tuition assurance scheme'</EMPHASIS> means a scheme whose main objects include&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and then we are given only one object. What are the other objects to be provided by regulation? It really is a bit too much. This is policy. Surely it is something that requires clear guidelines. How can the organisation and individuals involved know at this stage how they will be affected when that is all that the act says? That is the entire section. I have read it all. Those lines are all there are in this bill setting up this tuition assurance scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No wonder the industry is absolutely outraged and enraged and has so expressed itself in no uncertain terms this week to both the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the opposition. I quote from a communication from ACPET dated 18 October 1993 which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the October Board meeting of the Australian Council for Private Education and Training (ACPET), the following motion was passed unanimously:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"That ACPET objects most strenuously to the introduction of the Overseas Students Tuition Assurance Levy Bill 1993 into Parliament and seeks the suspension of further discussion on this Bill until the deliberations of the Working Group to develop a Tuition Assurance Scheme for the Industry is finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This motion seeks to express the Industry's view that the introduction of this Bill makes the work currently being undertaken in relation to the Tuition Assurance Scheme a total farce. All discussions to date have moved forward on a "without prejudice" basis. There is no agreement that the Scheme will involve the collection of levies as there is still strong support for a "placement only" scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of this Bill signifies a total railroading by Government of Industry. This is an unfortunate circumstance given Industry's willingness to work in close cooperation with Government to ensure the long term health of the education export industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kathleen Newcombe</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chairman</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACPET</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very succinct and significant letter. The industry wants to have a high reputation overseas. Australia is in competition with many other countries. It is not a piece of cake for us to get students here&mdash;to persuade students that Australia is the appropriate place to come. It is not in the interests of any of the service providers for Australia to have a reputation of being a place where, when fees are paid in advance, there is some risk about whether the organisation to which the fees were paid will actually provide the course. That is not in anyone's interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it crystal clear that the opposition supports the intent of the legislation. We absolutely agree that overseas students, and their funds, must be properly protected when they come here. We are as anxious as the government that Australia's reputation as a reliable supplier of education services for overseas students is of the highest possible level. As ACPET's communication said, the government's approach and the content of this bill make a farce of what was supposed to be a joint effort between government and industry, and amounts to a railroading of the industry by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that the education industry is a very major earner of foreign currency for Australia. It is in nobody's interests if industry and government are at cross-purposes. I cannot imagine why the government has proceeded in this way. Excuses about bills having to go to the Senate by a certain date do not hold water because this bill does not have to be passed this year. In fact, it is desirable that it not be, except to address one detail, the matter of the sunset clause, about which I must also make some comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will move some amendments to these bills in the committee stage. Effectively, it will seek to add sunset clauses to those sections of the bills on which the parliament must see details before the act can be put into effect. These regulations must be made public. We must see them and industry must see them. We will reserve our right to require that certain things be included in the act itself, not only in regulations, and that the act be amended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training has taken a close interest in this subject. It has conducted two inquiries and brought forward two reports. By and large, the recommendations of the reports are in the bill, although perhaps not in the form the Senate committee indicated it would like. However, the reports were absolutely adamant on one point&mdash;on this they were unanimous&mdash;and that was that the sunset clause in the act must remain&mdash;indeed, that it should be extended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sunset clause in the original act refers to 1 January 1994. Its purpose was to encourage the states to set up a legislative and regulatory framework, as they should, since they have the constitutional obligation to make legal provisions in this particular area. The states, or some of them, have not been as quick about it as they might have been, so if the act were to lapse in January we would have a bit of a mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From recollection, the Senate committee recommended that the sunset clause should be extended to January 1997. The government, therefore, should really be amending section 20 of the principal act. As I said, instead of expressing that unanimous and very adamant view of the Senate committee, section 13 of this bill says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 20 of the Principal Act is repealed.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is to be no sunset clause at all; it is to be repealed. There is absolutely no excuse for that, and the government makes no excuse. It mumbled something about certain roll-backs being a little easier, but that is not good enough. If there is a need to loosen up the operation of the present act so that rolling back certain provisions might be a little easier, the department can come up with better suggestions. Just doing away with the sunset clause altogether is not the optimum way to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, New South Wales Liberal Senator John Tierney moved a motion in the Senate&mdash;it was declared formal and has been passed&mdash;for the Senate to refer these bills to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, of which he is the deputy chairman. So the bills are going to the committee and there will be a report back on these. I would urge the committee to pay close attention to the issues that have been raised here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding, I will move an amendment to the motion for the second reading.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, I wish to say two other things as part of my conclusion. Firstly, we are not opposing the second reading of the bills; they will go through. Nevertheless we want to improve them while they are here, so we are going to move some amendments to them. Secondly, we support the need for the security of overseas students' pre-payments of fees to be buttressed. However, when in the amendment to the motion for the second reading I refer to the tuition assurance scheme, I am not referring to the tuition assurance scheme that is provided for in the amending bill before us. There is a need for some sort of scheme which would give this assurance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After listening to the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), one would think that the government was launching a massive assault on the Little Red Riding Hood fan club or the Quakers Religious Society of Friends, and that the government really went overboard in trying to do something about what I regard as a very serious problem. In this field we are faced with the credibility of this country overseas in its attempts to sell education, most particularly to Asia. At the same time, an aspect of this particular field that I want to cover, which I think is interrelated, is the problem of a lack of controls, a lack of regulation and a lack of concern. We should not decrease government intervention in the field. We have had a situation which has had a particular impact on our migration program. The government's failure to think ahead when it decided to facilitate this industry in 1985 has led to a crucial situation, the final outcome last week being the announcement by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) that 18,000 Chinese students who were in Australia before Tiananmen Square, and their 9,000 dependants, would be staying in this country. At the same time it is interrelated with the post-Tiananmen Square group where 16,000 of those 26,000 have launched refugee claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 a very ebullient minister made the comment that Australia would be replacing riding on the sheep's back with  balancing on a mortar board. As I said earlier, the government at that time&mdash;and the opposition even more intensely&mdash;decided that there was no need to take regard of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs or to be concerned with the private institutions. It was decided that we should really make sure that we got the big bucks overseas. What we see here tonight is an attempt to overcome part of that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Typical of the reality rather than the rhetoric were the comments of the Deputy Secretary to the Department of Employment, Education and Training when he came before the Senate inquiry and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been a sea change in attitude to the appropriateness of regulation in this industry and the adequacies of the ECOS Act, as a result of the closure of ABC.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a Perth-based college, which, basically, defrauded overseas students. There we have a clear statement from the department that, rather than take a more laissez-faire, easygoing attitude to this particular industry, we should make sure that it has a degree of regulation. We can quibble tonight about whether certain aspects are going to be left to regulation and are not going to be decided for a few months but, essentially, the government had to do something about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where the taxpayers&mdash;initially because of the immigration situation where large numbers of Chinese students had to be denied visa entry because of the way in which this system was being defrauded for immigration purposes&mdash;are still paying for the consequences of that decision with that particular college. A figure of about $2 million is being tossed around to compensate the students who paid their fees up front and then saw the college collapse and fail to provide them with tuition. They saw people basically taking money out of funds to which they were not entitled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So for honourable members to come into the House tonight and to say that we can leave this for a few months and that we are very unfair to the institutions in the field is really not a serious proposition. As I said earlier, in the inquiry by the Senate committee there was unanimity on the issue of sunset clauses. But it is worth noting with regard to the tuition assurance scheme that on page 16 of its report the committee referred to the concern of ELICOS with this fund. ELICOS is one of the associations in the field. It put up its own little personalised concept of how we should deal with it all, obviously with the least disadvantage to itself. The all party committee commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For other sectors of the industry this particular approach would not be feasible due to the specialised nature of the courses. Some form of insurance fund would be needed.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have a situation where the industry cannot agree on how it rectifies a very obvious problem. As I said earlier, we are not talking about an industry that has had an unblemished record but one that has had a systematic collection of problems over a very long period of time. This is not the first time that the Australian taxpayers have become involved or that the Australian government has had to approach other individual colleges to see whether they would take up the students, and then approach embassies in other parts of the world to try to defend Australia's credibility internationally in regard to our ability to sell education overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of complaints about the legislation: it puts an impost on the industry; we are doing it too soon; certain institutions in the field believe that we should delay it until June next year; and that there will be expense to the industry, et cetera. In reality, we have an industry which has got a fairly lamentable record, one which is damaging the country's image. It is an image that is fairly important because people in the field&mdash;the private sector&mdash;have said that the industry, worth $1.2 billion a year to Australia, will, in their expectations, reach $2 billion in the next three to five years. So it is a matter of importance.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has brought in a number of measures in this bill which I feel&mdash;and which basically the Senate committee thought&mdash;will rectify the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to return briefly to my concerns about some of the ways this particular industry came into the field in the late 1980s. In retrospect, it might have been desirable had the Department of Employment, Education and Training taken a bit more notice of the concerns of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986-87, 945 Chinese PRC students applied to come here. By 1989 the number had reached 21,000. Following the Tiananmen Square incident, a decision was made in June 1990 that large numbers of people be given full work and welfare rights and the ability to bring families into this country. Because of the lack of interest and concern by the Department of Employment, Education and Training, there was a contrivance to get around our immigration laws. Basically, if a person was prepared to pay so many thousand dollars that person could get into Australia and occasionally show up for courses. There was very limited intervention by the department to discipline people, control them and know whether they attended classes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the total picture. I am pleased to say that in the last few years, because of pre-visa clearances, the requirement for people to make a self-assessment as to whether they would pass the new rules&mdash;because we have designated certain countries as high-risk overstaying countries&mdash;and perhaps because of the different visa charges applying to different categories and countries, there has been a pronounced improvement in the problem of people overstaying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all part of a very serious picture. Some $65.2 million had to be paid by the Australian people to those whose visa applications were rejected, for loans to institutions to take up the slack of failed companies, and for direct student payments. In return, the government was assigned the right to prosecute for some of this money. An amount of $35 million is still outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over $2 million had to be paid out to the institution that started the push towards further legislation. This is all part of the overall problem of deportation charges. In 1992-93, it cost $6.25 million to deport people. There were 8,000 supervised departures, including 1,000 deportations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This category has been a crucial ingredient in the overstaying problem because the government&mdash;with the very raucous support of the opposition which wanted perhaps to be even more free and easy&mdash;decided that there could be very limited inquiries as to who was coming here and for what purpose. I note from the August 1993 program report for the department that it has a number of targets in this field. One was stated as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to promote integrity, quality and growth in the provision of Australian education and training services to overseas students.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of other targets for the next year. In August the department spoke about strengthening the act. A complete review of the code of conduct for overseas marketing was undertaken. Others include the creation of national minimum standards, consolidation of existing policy in a revised version of the international students policy handbook, and a wider review of the pre-visa assessment rules. There was talk of working with the department of immigration to simplify visas and widen scope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been success in reducing the overstaying problem by imposing some restrictions, carrying out a lot more checks and, as I said earlier, creating different classifications of countries. I hope the department does not become over-confident and revert to its former practices. That could lead to reduced inquiries as to who is coming in and for what purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department's representatives have admitted their error. The Senate inquiry report said that there were a lot of problems in this field. At the same time, it said that the present reporting restrictions on the institutions were too strenuous. Far from the department not checking thoroughly enough on whether the reports were put in on time, the government had to suspend a significant number of institutions&mdash;some 15&mdash;for failing to abide by the requirements last year. They were not allowed to run courses. Rather than a failure by the department to police the institutions, it is more a case of the law not fully understanding how difficult it is for some companies in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, we have the intention to set up trust funds, to bring them under state laws and to ensure that there is far more control over what is done with students' fees. Just because the people are from overseas and might find it difficult to operate within our legal system, they should not be ripped off by institutions being allowed to keep the moneys. The money should be in trust funds; it should be protected. It should be there for the purpose of running courses and institutions, not for personal benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the government has said that it recognises a reluctance to prosecute in this field. This has been crucially related to the fact that there have been monetary penalties. Section 4 relates to providing, offering to provide, inviting to undertake, or applying to undertake courses. If an institution breaches that section&mdash;that is, when it is not a registered provider&mdash;there is a $10,000 penalty. There has been a reluctance by legal sections to do anything about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another clear sign that it is about time something was done. It is time there were a few tough measures in the field. That is why we see a two-year penalty for intentionally or recklessly breaching this requirement. That again is a very worthwhile gesture towards enhancing Australia's credibility overseas. That is the thrust of the legislation throughout. Imprisonment provisions of 12 months to two years have been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something else that seems to concern members of the opposition is the introduction of stipulations on the way in which providers draw money from student accounts. This was discussed by the Senate inquiry. There was debate between departments, senators and different groups involved in the industry. It was clear that there was a significant fault in section 6 of the act. People were signing up for courses with limited knowledge of how things operated. People arrived in Perth from overseas, a contract was put in front of their faces and they were told to sign. Students were actually allowing colleges to take the money up front in the first months of a course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is moving to restrict the amount of money that these companies can draw out at any time. A percentage may be deducted for pre-commencement, administrative and arrangement fees, and 45 per cent may be taken out at the commencement of the course. The rest of the money due to these companies will be deducted weekly, as work goes on and they provide something. No great controversy was provoked among the private institutions with this legislation. There was no suggestion that they were very uptight about it all. Debate concentrated more on whether the figure should be 60 or 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was widespread industry support because it was recognised that a few participants were damaging the entire industry. We then had the tuition levy to try to do something about guaranteeing some access to education for these people if, after all these efforts by the government and the department, people did not put money into trust accounts. If people ignored the requirements of how much money could be deducted, and at what times, and if people blatantly went ahead and decided they would ignore the laws of the country, action had to be taken to provide some protection for students. They should not be left on the beach and asked to pay out another $5,000 to get into another course. There had to be some protection for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government quite correctly decided upon a tuition assurance scheme, which means that two months after the introduction of this particular section of the bill the individual schools must become members of the scheme and comply with its requirements. If they do not become members they breach the act and will not be allowed to operate in the field. They will not be allowed to run colleges if they cannot be bothered to become part of this fund&mdash;a fund which is not there to benefit the government or employ a few bureaucrats, but to ensure that when these colleges collapse people can get into an alternative course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the taxpayers of this country, through the government and the public servants, are trying to put people into this or that college and provide students with alternative courses. At the same time, we are running around the place giving taxpayers' money to these colleges to discount their fees for students who were not initially their responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a few complaints from the opposition about this legislation: that it is very onerous and demanding; that the private institutions do not like it; and that it is too restrictive. That criticism is more than balanced by the way the legislation protects our image overseas in a field which some speculate&mdash;probably with a great degree of truth&mdash;might be worth $2 billion in the next three to five years. Those considerations overwhelm any kind of arguments that we should be overly concerned&mdash; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Although not considered to be of high profile in the context of the current budget deliberations, they continue to show the Australian people, and more importantly overseas countries, that we value education as a vital part not only of our culture but also of our export-earning potential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are times when a government should use its parliamentary powers in order to ensure that the rights of individuals and groups are protected in adequate and appropriate legislative forms. This is in stark contrast to the attitude of those on the other side of the House who have unswerving faith in the power of market forces, and a belief that government should not intervene. This government has a different philosophical base. It is unwilling to accept the view that a mysterious equilibrium will apply to ensure that the best interests of the individual will triumph. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) mentioned so succinctly to the parliament in question time today, this side of the House does value education, and values it most highly. Retention rates in our schools have risen dramatically over the 10 years of Labor rule in this country. More young people than ever are entering TAFE and university colleges. Equally as important is the fact that Australia is now seen as the provider of very high quality marketable education systems. As the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) rightly told us, the value currently runs at $1.2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we ever hear any praise from those on the other side of the House? No! All we hear is doom and gloom and constant sniping about what we do. They raise hoary chestnuts, such as: what is happening to the New Zealand students; will they be classified as overseas students; and, if so, what will happen to them? Yesterday, I was fortunate to share a meal with some of our young skill olympians, who won four medals in Taipei. Australia was the highest ranking English-speaking country at that competition. These young people represent the excellence that abounds in so many of our educational institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The high quality of our education services within Australia is something of which we can all be very proud. That high quality has also been recognised outside Australia. Many other countries, especially those in the Asia-Pacific region, now look to Australia as a successful model of educational provision. As with our other products&mdash;quality food, manufactured goods and technology&mdash;education is a marketable commodity. As time goes by, the marketing of all our developed skills overseas will be seen more widely by the community as part of the mainstream economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of overseas students using our educational services has risen dramatically in recent years. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses in a plethora of locations throughout Australia cater for students from a host of countries. In my state of Tasmania alone we have close on 800 international students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both publicly funded institutions and private industry have responded to this demand. In the main the response has been to set up educational services of the highest integrity. When we look at the outcomes for overseas students, Australia can say that, for the most part, it has delivered a quality service. But there have been occasions when the free market system, which has operated previously without adequate regulation, has failed. Overseas students have been the victims of this free market approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been occasions when a privately run education service has been set up in response to overseas student demands and student fees have been, at best, managed badly and, at worst, stolen. How can it be that, even with evidence of educational services ripping off overseas students, those on the other side of the House are reluctant to protect those students?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Serious implications for Australia's multitude of other trade and export markets flow from this stance. If students who visit our country do not receive adequate educational services and, in addition, have their student fees bled illegitimately from them, only harm can be done by this part of our export industry. Australia's reputation as a fair and just country is at stake. If the Liberal Party's free market ideology were taken to its natural conclusion, there must be confidence and understanding that all parties will operate in a fair way. Education service providers using bad practices to hurt overseas students can only undermine that confidence and, in effect, break down our burgeoning and successful education trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has the will to face up to the problems that have already occurred in relation to the provision of education services to overseas students. Tonight the government presents appropriate legislation to this House. The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill 1993 will protect students from previous shady practices, and will also protect Australia's reputation as a provider of quality and equitable education services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been mentioned by previous speakers, the five major changes proposed by the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill are to ensure that the rights of students are protected. Firstly, there is a requirement to set up trust accounts instead of special accounts for pre-paid fees. Whereas in the past student fees were placed into accounts that were made available to educational providers without due protection, providers must now establish formal trust deeds for pre-paid fees. Secondly, the bill provides the maximum allowable draw-down from trust accounts and refunds to be paid if a provider defaults in course provision. This section also regulates the amounts of money that can be drawn from the student trust accounts by the education provider, thus ensuring that the provider does not default and leave the student with no funds at all. If a provider closes operations for some reason, there is provision in the bill for the student to receive the remaining funds belonging to him within two weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the bill replaces the existing section 7 with the new requirement that non-exempt providers join a tuition assurance scheme to guarantee course provision to students of defaulting providers. As has previously been mentioned, with the collapse of a business college in Perth in January this year, there is a real need to provide assurances to students when a provider defaults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This provision is necessary to rebuild credibility into the industry, and the tuition assurance scheme is part of that. I will not go on to mention the criminal penalties which have been adequately addressed by the honourable member for Reid, nor will I mention the provision which provides for the power to cancel the registration of a suspended provider who ignores the restrictions of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, these bills have arrived in the House not before time.

<PARA>Two sections of the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill are covered by clauses 1 to 12. I outlined the basis of this in my speech on the second reading. I absolutely reject the statement by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick) that the opposition was reluctant to support measures to protect students. I went to some pains to point out in my speech that we agreed that this was vital for the industry. I also pointed out that those industry organisations I quoted, who are opposed to proceeding with the bill in this form without knowing what is in store, also made it very clear that they wish the students and the integrity of our present education system for overseas students to be protected too. So there is no dispute at all about intent. There is a very substantial, real and serious dispute about the effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 1 and amendment 2 subclauses (2A), (2B) and (2C) relate to the trust accounts that are proposed to be set up under clause 5 of this bill. Proposed subclauses (2D), (2E) and (2F) relate to the tuition assurance scheme, covered by clause 8 of this bill. So those two aspects&mdash;trust accounts and the tuition assurance scheme&mdash;are affected by these amendments. The thrust of the amendments is that, to meet the objection that the opposition has raised to these bills in the form in which they are before us at the moment, we really need to have put before the parliament, the matters of substance before we proceed to put these measures into legislative form. The amendments underline the fact that we reject, for example, that the objects of a tuition assurance scheme should be unknown to us, yet severe penalties will be put onto education providers if they do not measure up to some objects that we know nothing about, except for one that is mentioned. I referred to that in my speech at the second reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these providers cannot join the tuition assurance scheme, if they do not measure up according to these regulations, then they are out of business. We are told nothing about on what grounds they would be put out of business, how they would be put out of business, or what appeal mechanism, if any, they would have. There is just not a hint of any of that in the minister's second reading speech, nor in the explanatory memorandum and certainly not in the bill. So if this bill should go forward&mdash;and perhaps it should to a certain extent, but I would suggest not through the parliament&mdash;then, if when the regulations come in they are considered and considered unacceptable, and if there is a motion to disallow them in either chamber and that motion is successful, then the whole scheme just becomes inoperative and we are back to where we are now. It does not upset any of our present legislation. So that is the thrust of the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context I want to refer to a couple of matters. I would not want the honourable member for Franklin to think that I was particularly stung by what he said. However, this opposition is not petty, and it is not carping. It reflects the considered views of the industry. I remind the honourable member for Franklin that the government has been going through a process of consultation with the industry, but the government has come up with something that is quite different from what the industry had been led to expect would result from those consultations. The consultations stopped short of actually telling those in the industry what was in the bill after it was introduced into the parliament. The government did not even bother giving them copies of the bill. It was not until the opposition asked them their opinions that they knew there were any bills in parliament that would affect them. I point out that their entire livelihood could be eliminated by these bills, so they are bills of some significance to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned in my speech on the second reading that Bond University is in a unique position. It is the only university that is substantially affected by this legislation. All the other universities in Australia&mdash;except for Notre Dame, which is only small at this stage&mdash;being government universities will be exempt from the provisions of the bill. Bond University, being a private university, will not be exempt. So it is in a unique position, and will be forced to join this tuition assurance scheme. Bond University is a public company and all its activities, accounts and financial reporting requirements are subject to audit now. It has all the same restrictions that are put on any public company. The university already has that restriction on it. It has to spend money in its internal systems to make sure that it does measure up. If this proposal were to be adopted, not only would it have to do all that, but it would also have to pay a levy and measure up for this other scheme too, which puts it in a uniquely disadvantaged position as against every other university in Australia. The Bond University points out, as have many others&mdash;it would not be news to the government&mdash;that it sees this as a form of taxation. </PARA>

So it is simply not true to assert, as has been asserted, that there has not been communication or consultation with the industry. It might, I think, reflect more the self-interests of the industry. I cannot quite fathom why the industry appears to be opposed to setting up a scheme to insure itself and its students against shonky business dealings.

The fact is that we had a rather tumultuous event with the ABC College in Perth involving 350 international students. That was great for our reputation! It has cost us $2.2 million to recompense those students. We are suggesting that it is appropriate that the industry should be self-regulating and have an insurance scheme and that we in fact work with the industry to develop that scheme. We have employed a consultant who will advise the government on the legal structure and administration of the scheme and financial accounting and arrangements.

<PARA>This is the bill that would actually impose the levies for the tuition assurance scheme that has been discussed in debate on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill that has just passed this chamber. There are very serious concerns about this levy bill and about its constitutionality, about whether it constitutes a tax or whatever. However, the coalition's concern here is that the method of collection of the levy and everything else&mdash;all the details of it, and certainly the level at which it is going to be struck because it is going to be a financial impost on the industry&mdash;is to be done entirely by regulation. So the purpose of this amendment to the Overseas Students Tuition Assurance Levy Bill is effectively again to say that, if parliament were to disallow the regulations, the act&mdash;as it would then be&mdash;would be deemed to be repealed so that, if the regulations that the government brings in are not acceptable, disallowing them would mean that the act would no longer stand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 makes a number of changes to higher education, many of which are non-controversial and some of which have provoked some controversy. The changes are basically funding to the third year of the triennium&mdash;1994 to 1996. The coalition has no difficulty with that. The second change is to the open learning scheme whereby open learning will have a deferred payment so that HECS will now be applicable to open learning. The coalition's view is that this is a sensible change and we are happy to support it. The third change is to specific recurrent purpose grants. These are grants over which the minister has some discretion and they relate to grants for quality, grants for national priority, grants for equality of opportunity and special research assistance grants. These four areas are being incorporated into one area. If we take the department's line, this will give greater flexibility. If we had a slightly less charitable view, it would be that the minister has a little more flexibility over his slush fund. Nonetheless, the government has the right to make these changes and the coalition does not oppose them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say in passing that the specific recurrent purpose grants for quality, while possibly a noble idea, have yet to be proven in practice. It would seem that the government is having some difficulty in working out how to determine quality. The latest effort of determining quality is by public servants walking round and trying to assess it university by university. I suspect this is doomed to failure. Nonetheless, the government has a right to have a go at it. If it works, we are happy to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth change in this legislation refers to research. While the government has proposed fairly radical changes to research, the changes incorporated in this legislation relate only to the total amount of funding and to the postgraduate awards themselves. I am particularly disappointed at the way in which the number of postgraduate awards have been reduced. This has been done largely by abolishing course work awards. The number of research awards will stay fairly much the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some personal feeling for this because I was the beneficiary of a course work award in 1986 when I decided to go back and do postgraduate study. It was of enormous help to me. It would have been very difficult for me to undertake that study. I competed for that on the basis of merit and it is something for which I was, and remain, very grateful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that, as a large number of areas are having course work degrees as part of professional qualifications, these grants are not available on the basis of merit. It is also a pity that, in merging postgraduate course work awards and postgraduate research awards, it will reduce dramatically the opportunity for students doing postgraduate course work. I note in passing that the number of scholarships this year is dropping from 23,730 to 20,700. It seems a fairly strange way to me to promote a clever country by reducing the opportunity for people studying at a postgraduate level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next change relates to the higher education contribution scheme. This is somewhat controversial, and I will come back to that later. The final changes are amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, which will allow HECS to be paid under PAYE&mdash;the coalition is happy to support this&mdash;and amendments to the Taxation (Interest on Overpayments) Act 1983, which means that, if the taxpayer makes an overpayment that is subsequently returned to the taxpayer, the Australian Taxation Office will pay interest to the taxpayer. Clearly, this is of benefit to the taxpayer and we are happy to support that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area where we have some difference with the government relates to the higher education contribution scheme. I foreshadow that at the conclusion of my remarks I shall move the following second reading amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the view that the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training should be asked to examine in particular and report on the proposed increases of HECS to 1.5 and 2.0 times the standard rate, the equity and hardship effects of these changes and whether or not adequate arrangements exist for refugees whose qualifications are not appropriate in Australia".</PARA>
<PARA>I foreshadow that, when we come to the committee stage, we will move two amendments, which I will detail in just a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the higher education contribution scheme are threefold. Firstly, a penalty will be placed on students who take longer than a standard time to complete their degree. Secondly, students who complete a second undergraduate degree will be required to pay a higher contribution. Thirdly, the threshold rate will be lowered and the rate of repayment will be increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take these changes one at a time. Increasing HECS to 1 1/2 times the standard rate if a person takes more than six months longer to complete a degree might have some superficial appeal. It struck me that this was particularly unfair. Students who took longer to complete their degrees 20 years ago may have been those who enjoyed the more social aspects of university and were not particularly focused. I do not think that is fair today. Today I think those who take longer are predominantly those kids who have got personal, financial or family problems and that precludes them from finishing the degree in the minimum time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, there is a problem for students who have to do prerequisite subjects before they can go on to their degrees. The vice-chancellors inform me that this is most common in engineering. There is also a problem with degrees which are based on a year rather than a semester. I raised this matter with DEET&mdash;the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) kindly provided me with a briefing&mdash;and DEET commented that, `Perhaps degrees should all be based on semesters'. But I think this ignores what really happens at universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With some degrees, particularly medicine&mdash;my former profession&mdash;it will never be possible to work on a semester basis. These changes would mean that, if one failed one subject, one would have to repeat the whole year. A number of other professional, medical and paramedical qualifications are like this. It struck me that this was particularly harsh and applying it after six months was a hardship that, quite frankly, I did not think was fair. One of the amendments that I foreshadow in the committee stage will take this out from six months to 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon the Green senators from Western Australia put out a press release saying that the government is prepared to back down on this point and I welcome that. But the amendments that I find myself now in possession of I have somewhat by luck&mdash;they were circulated in this chamber barely over an hour ago. I attempted to do the minister the courtesy of circulating my amendments to him some time ago and I do not quite know what slipped up; but it is pretty tough when we have to try to debate amendments that one receives by luck rather than anything else. It would appear that the government is prepared to back down on these amendments and remove the 1.5 times HECS increase altogether and I certainly welcome that move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second change that I foreshadow for the committee stage relates to double HECS for second degrees. On the surface, again, a reasonable argument can be put forward for it; but there are some problems here. People undertaking a second degree are not always people who have nothing else to do and want to while away their time. Again, from personal experience, I am a beneficiary of this and perhaps I should consider myself exceedingly lucky. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My experience is that, particularly in medical or paramedical areas, people who go back and do second degrees are often mature age people, and they do this at considerable personal sacrifice. Usually, their partner works and, usually, they find themselves in a very difficult personal situation of making a commitment to a future career&mdash;a career for which, if one worked on a strict cost benefit analysis, one might not find a cost advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It strikes me as particularly unfair&mdash;and the correspondence I have received over the last six to eight weeks has borne this out&mdash;on those people who are already in their second degree, who have made that decision, to change the rules on them halfway through. It just does not make sense. The government has the right to make this change if it wishes. While it is not something we would have proposed ourselves, we are prepared to concede that a government may choose to do this in a budget. But, if it is going to happen, it is not fair to have a go at those already undertaking their study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the coalition is proposing to move an amendment here&mdash;we will back it up in the Senate&mdash;to the effect that, if the government wishes to do this, it should start from 1994. Those people already in their degrees who have made personal arrangements and personal commitments should be allowed to finish on the basis on which they started. If someone wants to go ahead and commence a degree next year, at least they do it knowing what they are up for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effects of the government's move are brought home to me particularly by the case of a constituent and friend of mine who is a Cambodian refugee. He qualified as a doctor in Cambodia. I have to tell the House that that is not of much use in Australia&mdash;although, given the peculiarities of Australia, it would not help him even if he had a medical degree from Oxford. The fact is that he attempted to get work any way he could after he arrived in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his early thirties, he decided that he would go back and do medicine. He started again in first year and he has really struggled. His wife has gone out to work. He has three kids at school and, because of his religious beliefs, those kids are at a non-government school which is something the parents find very difficult to afford. He is now in fifth year medicine. He has had to repeat that year because of his difficulties with the English language; but he is doing pretty well. Despite all of those difficulties, he would be hit with double HECS next year for finishing his degree. I would have less difficulty if he had started the degree knowing that would happen; but, after the great sacrifice he has already made, it is fundamentally unfair that he should be hit towards the end of his degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we will be moving these amendments here and backing them up in the Senate. We feel rather strongly about them and we are prepared to see them right the way through. Further, as I mentioned in the amendment that I have already moved, we would like to see this matter go to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I hope that this would not hold things up too much. We are very ready to accommodate the government on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have talked to different areas in the tertiary sector, to other individuals and to the department, it has been hard to get a consistent line on what allowances will be made for hardship and what allowances will be made for different equity considerations. The government has provisions in this bill that will allow the department to make these judgments; but the department has been pretty slow in getting out exactly what it will do and how it will operate. So, if the government or the department can satisfy the opposition's concerns in this area, we will be happy to let that go through in the Senate. If we cannot be satisfied, I foreshadow here that we are prepared to move and stick to further amendments in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my particular concerns is for refugees. I do not doubt that the government has similar concerns, and they were brought home particularly to me by the person I just mentioned. Unfortunately, in Australia a number of overseas qualifications are simply not recognised. It is not a matter of merit; it is a matter of us, as a country, making a decision that certain qualifications will be recognised and others will not. People who come here as refugees, who may have little choice in the matter and who might have come from particularly difficult circumstances, could find that degrees from Cambodia, Laos, Ethiopia or Nicaragua are pretty irrelevant to Australia. I have a lot of difficulty understanding how such degrees should affect the degrees they do in Australia. Nonetheless, the government has decided that it wants to do that. We would not have done it. I can hardly say we support it; but I think the government has a right to make that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Refugees are a special case. I want to be satisfied by the government that particularly refugees, but also other people who come from overseas under circumstances of hardship, who have gained qualifications overseas at no cost to the Australian taxpayer will be able to get a sympathetic and realistic hearing from the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could go further in this&mdash;certainly the argument has been put to me several times&mdash;and ask why on earth should a person who undertook a degree 20 years ago at no cost to the Australian taxpayer, or at little cost because at that stage our higher education system was very different, have to put up with paying double HECS today? Again, that is not something I would advocate personally. If my party put that up, I would fight it. In the whole context of the budget, we have tried to be responsible. We reluctantly say that a government has the right to do that; but I certainly hope the government may look at the consequences of doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point in relation to double HECS is that the fear is that those who will be most disadvantaged by this are women, particularly older women who choose to go back to university to upgrade their skills. I would hope that during the Senate standing committee inquiry the department&mdash;or, before that, the minister&mdash;can assure me that the concerns of women have been adequately taken into account and that the government will at least have in place a system to monitor whether or not women are being affected adversely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final changes in this HECS component are to reduce the threshold at which HECS comes in from $27,748 to $26,402 and to increase the rate of repayment. I will take them separately. Reducing the threshold has been put to me by the department as really just taking the figure down to average weekly earnings. It used to be at average weekly earnings, it has been indexed, but because average weekly earnings have dropped the index has left the figure too high. That is not a bad argument and is pretty convenient for something that really is just another tax grab. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the rates of repayment will increase from two, three and four per cent to three, four and five per cent, they will actually be more. If we take the increased thresholds into account, the increased repayments can be fairly dramatic. Again, that is just another grab for tax. I do not suggest for a moment I would have supported this if my party had been in government, but we are not. The students were very happy to actively support the Labor Party, so on this one they will be copping the full benefit of the party they supported. I would certainly foreshadow that in the run-up to the next election and when in government I would want to look at that because I am concerned about the equity considerations of these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I formally foreshadow&mdash;I suspect that under the guillotine I will not have time to do this&mdash;that, should we go into committee, I shall be moving the following amendment :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 14, page 6, line 32, omit "half".</PARA>
<PARA>This will have much the same effect as the amendment I understand the government is moving. I am happy to support the government amendment in deference to the coalition amendment, particularly as I understand the coalition amendment is going first. I also foreshadow that I intend to move in committee this second amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 15, page 7, line 15, after "basic course of study" insert "and the student started to undertake the course in 1994 or in a subsequent year".</PARA>
<PARA>I must read into the record part of a press release that came across my desk today from the Australian Democrats entitled, `Liberals sell out students'. In one sense I was very happy to have this press release because it finally told me who the Australian Democrats spokesperson on education is. I have had this shadow portfolio for six months and I have not been able to find out who their spokesperson is. I actually thought it was Senator Kernot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some points in this press release that are a bit beyond the pale. I understand the to-and-fro of politics&mdash;I have engaged in them myself&mdash;but we have announced our changes today two months after the budget because we were prepared to go through an exhaustive system of consultation and we were not prepared to make decisions based purely on what we guessed the government was going to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Democrats can hold their party room meetings in a telephone box and can make decisions in two or three minutes. The coalition is not able to do that. I can understand that the Democrats hold the balance of power if the Greens vote with them and if we decide to oppose the government, but we have to take a more responsible position than that. I am not prepared to go out and make pronouncements before I know what the government is proposing and before I have been through a consultation process with the industry and the students and also exhaustively with my own party, which takes a lot more than three minutes. Senator Bell's press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition's pro-student rhetoric was a blatant publicity stunt . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In one sense I am rather delighted that he concedes we are having a pro-student rhetoric. I do not think anyone else who has observed education politics in the last 18 months would have believed that. He further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberals have pinched our original amendments . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This is great, because I actually find out what his amendments are further on. Given that up until this afternoon I did not even know who the Democrats' spokesperson on education is, I am delighted that he thinks we have pinched their amendments. Until I got this press release, I really did not know what the amendments were. He further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats will still move amendments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to extend the minimum time which students have to complete their degrees before attracting a 50% increase . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is beaut. That is exactly what we have decided to do and is exactly what the government has agreed to do. Another Democrat amendment is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to prevent retrospectivity in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>That relates to my second amendment. I suspect this government may not agree to my amendment in this place, but with a bit of gentle arm twisting I hope it might see the argument in another place. The press release further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberals' vote counts only in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Maybe this is a reaction to some of the comments by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about the function of the Senate, but as someone who represents 110,000 people in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne I actually think the votes count in this place. The press release further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will wait and see if they join with us to pass these amendments in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>I find this a bit funny because our position is that, if we oppose it, we oppose it not only in this place but in both houses. But he is allowed his opinions. The final comment from the press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats called the Liberals' bluff weeks ago.</PARA>
<PARA>It is wonderful that he did. Next time, can he just let me know that he is calling our bluff and maybe we can respond? I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the view that the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training should be asked to examine in particular and report on the proposed increases of HECS to 1.5 and 2.0 times the standard rate, the equity and hardship effects of these changes and whether or not adequate arrangements exist for refugees whose qualifications are not appropriate in Australia". </PARA>

The government has recognised that, for which it should be commended. It is amazing to hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) in this place referring to this legislation as a tax grab. The whole strategy of the opposition seems to be that every revenue raising measure introduced in this House is now a tax grab. That is from the party that wanted to bring in the GST.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Leichhardt, students, parents and all citizens were very pleased with the last budget and with the Commonwealth government's commitment to higher education in Cairns. In the budget, the Commonwealth government increased its commitment to the Cairns campus of James Cook University to $15 million over four years. The 1993 federal budget honoured the election promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to provide $9.5 million during 1994-95 from the higher education capital development pool and committed an additional $5.5 million in 1996-97. We in the Leichhardt electorate are proud of the contribution that this small but new campus is already making to our community life. Since 1987, when undergraduate courses were first offered, enrolments have grown at an annual rate of 34 per cent. That means that there are 700 students this year. By the end of the decade, it is anticipated that enrolments will reach 2,000 students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to indicate the commitment that has been made to the building of a separate campus at Smithfield in Cairns. Currently, the campus is housed at Cairns TAFE. There is a new building that is being provided at Cairns TAFE, with the temporary quarters for the James Cook University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Cairns have requested, and have a right to, a separate campus. People in Sydney would be outraged if they were asked to have their children attend university in Canberra. Yet it is probably easier now to drive from Sydney to Canberra than it is to drive from Cairns to Townsville. It is essential that Far North Queensland has a separate university campus. It will be provided by a joint state and federal commitment to James Cook University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to rumours which I suspect have been spread by the Liberal Party&mdash;in that regard I can point to one Senator Macdonald&mdash;the plans are well on track to commence the building of the Cairns campus at JCU at the start of next year. Question No. 546 in the Senate asked by Senator Ian Macdonald would have had only one point to it: to increase uncertainty about the funding for James Cook and to make people in Cairns nervous about the government's intentions. This government has been very clear about that, but I think it is important for me to take the opportunity to indicate that site preparation will start in November 1993; building design will be completed by the end of 1993; and construction will commence in early 1994. That means that buildings will be ready by mid-1995 and, because of the Commonwealth government's extra commitment in this budget, another building will be made possible which will be ready as early as 1998. I hope that that building will contain a new library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you can see, the Commonwealth's commitment to education in regional areas is strong and vibrant. In addition to providing basic degrees in arts, commerce, education, science and social work, the campus plans to specialise in studies relating to the rainforest environment, East and South-East Asia and regional economic and community topics. A major thrust in environmental science and management at the campus will be led by the specially funded cooperative research centre for tropical rainforest ecology and management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A seven-year funding program of $41 million for this research centre was announced in September, $13 million of which is to be directly provided by the Commonwealth and the balance by the five partners in the centre: James Cook University, University of Queensland, Griffith University, the CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology and the Wet Tropics Management Authority. This federal government funding not only directly benefits school leavers and raises school levels attained in our region but also puts a very significant injection of money into the local and regional economy. It also increases local employment opportunities. Experience over 30 years at the Townsville campus of James Cook suggests that professionals trained locally are more likely to seek employment locally. They will thus help meet the expanding demand for their services in a region with one of the highest economic and population growths in Australia. </PARA>

It is just hypocritical of the opposition to come into this House and say anything about higher education. Anything it says about higher education really does not have much credence at all, especially in relation to HECS. The opposition has a policy of introducing up-front fees. To follow its policy, it should be moving an amendment in this House to introduce up-front fees. But, of course, it will not do that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to comment on the changes that the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill makes to the higher education contribution scheme specifically. Tonight's bill will increase the graduate tax liabilities of people studying today. I dislike the Labor Party's HECS increases contained in this bill. The reason is simple: they are unfair. I know; I have paid them myself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 no person with any sense of economic responsibility or credibility expects education to be free, but tertiary fees do not have to be levied in an unjust way&mdash;and HECS is. Under the scheme, students contribute about one-fifth of the average cost of a higher education place. Each semester students choose either to pay up-front or defer payment. Students who can pay their fee directly to the institution receive a discounted fee, with the Commonwealth paying the balance on their behalf. Students who defer payment are in a different situation. They accept a loan from the Commonwealth, which pays their liability for the semester to the institution. Students begin repaying those loans when their taxable income reaches a certain level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight we are changing the level of students' payments. When students sign the payment options form everything is fine if they can afford to pay up-front. But if they choose to pay later, students sign a one-sided contract with a party that can change conditions on a whim. The group this hits the most is the poor, the underprivileged and those who struggle, and this should not continue. Under HECS, students have no clear idea how much extra tax they will be paying once they graduate. At a time when budgeting is important&mdash;when they are establishing careers, buying houses or getting married&mdash;the government can suddenly increase repayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than repeating exercises like tonight's, we should be developing a fair HECS system where students know the level of payments they will have to make in the future. The government should have no power to increase charges once the payment options form for each semester's study has been signed. As it stands at the moment, HECS is regressive. Wealthier students can pay upfront; other students, faced with a choice of either deferring payments or not studying, sign an agreement that can increase the levels of graduate tax repayments at any time in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am amazed that my friend the honourable member for Leichhardt, who wears his social justice on his sleeve like a badge, can lead the government's defence&mdash;a paltry defence at that&mdash;of these changes. There may be a price to pay for the government's proposals, especially in Leichhardt. Students do not want to be afraid. They will suddenly be paying much steeper fees in the future. The coalition learnt this lesson at the last poll. Instead, a fair HECS system that spells out what students will be paying would be a guaranteed vote winner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first raised this matter in the House last month I described the government's changes as unfair tax measures that should not be passed. I hope I have been able to spark off some debate on the matter within my own party. For that reason, I am pleased to be able to support the amendments moved by the shadow minister for education, employment and training, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). These amendments are important as they ameliorate many of the government's more unjust proposals. They remove some of the government's retrospective and unanticipated changes that have made this bill such a clear demonstration of the failings of HECS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our proposals dealing with double HECS for second undergraduate degrees are very significant. They remove a substantial injustice&mdash;the retrospective structure of the government's proposals. This bill seeks to implement double HECS payments for second undergraduate degrees in a fundamentally unjust way by levelling extra charges to students already studying. Under the coalition's amendment, double HECS for subsequent degrees will apply only to students commencing second degrees in or after 1994, removing the element of retrospectivity, which is Liberal Party policy, in answer to my friend's questions earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes are significant and the result of wide consultations by the honourable member for Chisholm. I do not believe this bill is perfect; I am unsure about many aspects of it. However, I am glad I have been able to contribute to the debate within the party room. We have listened to students, academics and university administrators and tackled some of their concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I promised to try to convince my colleagues to oppose this bill. I kept my promise. While we are not opposing this bill, we are seeking to make it fairer for students, which is more than the honourable member for Leichhardt did. If we wish to produce high quality legislation that will serve the needs of students and the community, it will be important for us to build on this work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard a lot from the ALP throughout the election campaign about what a Liberal government would do to education. We heard more of that tonight from the honourable member for Leichhardt. Students were happy to campaign against the Liberal Party. Some of my colleagues do not sit here today because of their campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Union of Students was particularly aggressive. Now students have been done over by the government. Surprise, surprise! The government really appreciated the students' help. The NUS has miserably failed the people it claims to represent. Last week I was fortunate to speak to about 1,000 people at a student rally in Adelaide on the steps of state parliament opposing these HECS changes. These rallies were not held in most capital cities. Why? The reason is that the local NUS people outside South Australia do not want to damage chances of a career in the ALP. There is a quote I like that says, `The pure remain impotent'. A former Prime Minister made that statement. It is true of politics, especially when we are discussing an issue such as the one we are discussing tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bell and his Democrat colleagues can make all sorts of pious noises about education. The Democrats oppose tertiary fees. So what? The ALP and the coalition make the main decisions on such matters. The Democrats' opposition to tertiary fees has achieved nothing for students over the last five years. In fact, students could hardly be worse off. Students should not satisfy themselves with the support of the Democrats, as they have. The ALP has disregarded the concerns of students and ignored the National Union of Students. Students should learn the lesson that the government has taught them this year and broaden their horizons. There will be some sort of fee; it is inevitable. So students have to try to get the best deal for themselves. They have to work professionally with the major parties rather than making a lot of noise around the political fringe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all regard universities as a valuable resource. Members of a work force with better skills and a quality education will be able to enjoy a better standard of living and make a greater contribution to this country. Students cannot risk destroying this goodwill with unreasonable demands and self-interested stances. It is good to know that the honourable member for Chisholm is already building a new rapport with the NUS. There has been a lot of anger in the coalition over the treatment the NUS gave us in the lead-up to the poll, but I trust we can put that behind us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's amendments to tonight's legislation are important steps in the process. I would have liked to have convinced my colleagues to make more changes. There is a lot of work to be done before we can offer students a better deal. If we are to do that, students must be able to lobby more effectively. I want to get more of my colleagues to listen. They are not likely to pay much heed to outdated slogans shouted at noisy rallies. Students will get things done when they work within the mainstream, and then they will see legislation better than tonight's legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very conscious of the fact that the guillotine is on this particular debate tonight, and I know that there are other honourable members who wish to speak. Whatever we thought of Bob Hawke as a Prime Minister or as a member of parliament, when he proclaimed his desire for Australia to be the clever country he was absolutely right. Australia does need to be the clever country if we are going to succeed, and if we are going to provide the sort of lifestyle and the future for our young people that we all want for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be the clever country it is not sufficient to mouth empty rhetoric. We need to put our national money where our collective mouth is to provide the framework and the infrastructure so that our education services can be fully utilised by young Australians throughout our nation. One of the successful pieces of infrastructure that I am pleased to see going ahead at the present time is the new university of the north coast, to be known as the Southern Cross University, initially with campuses at Lismore and Coffs Harbour. The Lismore campus, originally a CAE, amalgamated with the University of New England's Armidale, Orange and Coffs Harbour campuses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new university will initially have two campuses, one at Coffs Harbour and the other at Lismore, with open learning centres at some other areas on the north coast. As the member for Cowper, representing the mid-north coast of New South Wales, I am absolutely delighted that the Southern Cross University will open its doors officially on 1 January next year. It will also incorporate open learning access centres in the Tweed, Clarence and Hastings areas, and will be sponsored by the University of New South Wales for the first three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year the university will have 4,500 Commonwealth funded places, and a further 1,000 privately funded or industry sponsored student places. Coffs Harbour will have 440 students. The current Coffs Harbour student population of 330 will at least double by 1996, and climb to almost 800 student places by 1998. That is a significant benefit to the mid-north coast in general, and Coffs Harbour in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new university is provided with an additional 90 student places for both 1994 and 1995, and at least 140 of these 180 new places have been provided for the Coffs Harbour campus. The Coffs Harbour intake for 1994 will be 215. The growth in university places is good news for potential university students not only in Coffs Harbour but the whole region by providing far better access for tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year the university will put on an additional five staff in Coffs Harbour, a further five in 1995 and a further five in 1996. That does not sound a great many, but I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is a very significant increase in terms of employment and the injection into the local economy. The new university will spend $3.3 million on operations in Coffs Harbour next year. By 1996, this will have increased to more than $6 million. Next year's direct university contribution to the local economy will be close to $17 million, with student spending and capital expenditure at the new construction site of Hogbin Drive. That is really great news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The indirect contribution to the local economy is estimated to be more than $50 million, which is a very significant input. A wide variety of courses are being provided in business, computing, paralegal studies, the arts and social science. This new university, with its two campuses at Lismore and Coffs Harbour, will be an important asset for the whole of the north coast, providing tertiary education to country students who, in the past, have had to travel to metropolitan areas to study. It will make a very significant difference to a great many families who have to spend an enormous amount of money to send their kids to university in Brisbane, Sydney, Newcastle or even Armidale. It is a very significant piece of social equity that will be of great benefit to everybody living in that general area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Australians do not realise just how significant the growth in higher education has been. While we on this side of the House are rightly critical from time to time of what the government has done in certain aspects of higher education, the figures from 1982 to 1992 show that the total number of students taking on higher education has increased by 64 per cent from 341,390 to 559,365. To be fair, one has to acknowledge that there has been a significant useful improvement and that a great many more young Australians are receiving valuable tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also significant that commencing student numbers have increased by 68 per cent to 210,599 and that course completions increased by 61 per cent from 66,888 in 1982 to 107,561 in 1991. We are starting to move along the road to the clever country. But in spite of those enviable growth rates, there is still an enormous number of young Australians who cannot get places in universities. This is where it is right and proper that the opposition should be critical of what the government has been doing in that area. As I said, I have to be fair and acknowledge that there has been growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be funding of $638.7 million for TAFE in 1994. The federal government will provide for vocational education and training. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) announced that nearly $639 million would be provided. Those funds will be supplemented by state and territory money and will help create 40,000 new TAFE places and fund more than 130 building projects across the country. Undoubtedly this is another area where money is being spent to good effect. A lot more needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in passing, as I have mentioned TAFE, that the new university campus at Coffs Harbour is very innovative. It involves the three levels of education. On the one site there will be the campus of Southern Cross University, a new TAFE college and a new technology high school. All three levels of education will share the same site and some of the same facilities&mdash;such as libraries and other items&mdash;which will result in all three areas going ahead without the requirement for separate infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the national retention rate of students completing a full secondary education to year 12 was more than 70 per cent for 1991. The proportion of 15- to 17-year-olds interested in undertaking university courses increased from 20 per cent in 1984 to 41 per cent in 1990. An evaluation showed that what secondary students appeared to believe about tertiary education, compared with other post-secondary options such as TAFE, apprenticeships, private colleges and traineeships, was that it leads to greater potential earnings and the ability to enter higher status occupations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grant for higher education leads to pressures on all parts of the system; on students, staff, institutions and the government. Therefore, it is absolutely essential for the government to treat higher education as a funding priority. Tertiary education can lead to enhanced job opportunities at a time of record unemployment levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any young Australian in secondary school at the moment should plan and hope to get a university education, because it will be the key to success. I suggest very seriously that we do not want to encourage an academic ivory tower attitude. It is very important that students be encouraged to undertake work experience while they are studying, so they have some contact with reality, some understanding of what it is like in the workplace. Undoubtedly that would give them a foot in the door in seeking employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by stating that the pursuit of excellence must be the prime objective of all levels of education. Higher education is vital in our society and, as a nation, we should encourage all our young people to get the best education they possibly can. </PARA>

As you know, Mr Speaker, many people visit this august parliament and have admired the rather splendid building in which we have the privilege to be able to work.

When I meet with them I talk to them about the nature of the building. I draw to their attention the amount of money that was put into not only building this place but also furnishing it. I emphasise when I talk to them the importance of the parliamentary institution and that it is only because we attach a great deal of importance to the institution itself that we have deigned to spend as much as we have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it was surprising to me that a family visiting from my electorate, Mr and Mrs Max Boyes of South Turramurra&mdash;I understand Mr Boyes is the rector of the local Church of England church in South Turramurra&mdash;observed that parts of the building, they thought, were distinctly unfinished in appearance. I must say it was not one of those matters that had come to my notice with any pressing need to address. Nevertheless, when I had it pointed out to me it became patently clear that if one looks at the doorstoppers that are used around this building they are distinctly add-on. They are usually triangular pieces of wood with very little regard paid to the amenity of the building. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) drew the attention of the House to a ship, the Indian registered <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anano</EMPHASIS> currently undergoing enforced repairs at Gladstone in his electorate. As I was in Queensland last week, I was contacted by the maritime unions who invited me to inspect this ship. I was pleased to do so last Friday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ship has some 140 defects. I was prevented from going aboard, but I understand that as well as these faults, the two mates on the ship were only cadets and did not have proper certificates. One would have thought that if everything on this ship had been in order, the master would have welcomed me to assure me that everything was indeed in order. By his refusal to let me on the ship, we can only assume that things are much worse than I had been told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I speak here tonight, there are six seriously defective foreign flagged ships being detained in Australian ports. Two of these ships are classified by Lloyds Register of Shipping&mdash;perhaps the foremost classification society in the world. I have recently read some criticism that because so many ships are being detained, adequate measures are not being taken to deal with seriously substandard ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest that it is because the Australian Maritime Safety Authority has stepped up its inspections. The unions, usually at smaller ports, are more aware and more likely to report defective shipping. In short, because of the publicity from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of Shame</EMPHASIS> report, people are more aware of the many dangerous rust buckets plying our waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also amazed that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anano</EMPHASIS> was given a single voyage permit. I would like to know who issued this permit. Such permits are supposed to be issued only when no Australian shipping is available, but the ships are supposed to be up to Australian standards. With 140 serious defects, mates without tickets and unhealthy and unhygienic conditions, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anano</EMPHASIS> is certainly not up to Australian standards. I call on the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) to immediately tighten up on the issue of permits for single voyages, and also to name those who issued the permit for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anano</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what we could expect if cabotage were abolished and we opened our coastal trade to the rust buckets of the world. Australia now has one of the most modern merchant fleets, if not the best, and one of the best trained seafaring forces in the world. For this we can largely thank the tripartite 10-year effort between government, industry and unions. Reform in Australian shipping has been one of the major achievements of the government's micro-economic reform process. It has resulted in a major reform of this traditionally difficult industry which has gone almost totally unremarked by either the press of the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those calling for the introduction of foreign flag ships in Australia, disguise it how they may, are advocating tax avoidance. The huge advantage that these owners have over Australian shipowners is that they pay little or no tax. They are not smarter or better; they just do not have the tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign flags are cheaper because they do not pay tax, but that is no reason to import them into our domestic economy. The argument that this would lead to a competitive balance between Australian flagships and foreign flags is nonsense. The Australian ships would flag out immediately in order to gain the tax advantages of their competitors and we would finish up with no Australian fleet at all. If this is what the opposition is proposing, it is proposing that we in Australia exchange safe, well maintained and well crewed ships for the foreign ships. Additionally, it would put several thousand seafarers onto the dole and significantly increase our balance of payments problem through the profits and wages repatriated out of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that the government did not take up the recommendation contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of Shame</EMPHASIS> report to impose substantial fines on defective ships such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anano</EMPHASIS>. It is also time that we got serious about ship brokers. There are many unanswered questions about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anano</EMPHASIS>&mdash;questions about the brokers. It is not good enough condemning foreign owners when the ships are being marketed by Australian brokering firms, such as Pacific Rim Shipping of Melbourne. These people have a couple of ships. The honourable member for Hinkler mentioned another one last night that was recently in Mackay. All the fault for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of Shame</EMPHASIS> is not overseas. There are many greedy Australians in the chain who have little regard for human life and our marine environment. Let us hit them where it hurts most&mdash;in their pockets. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Watt of Greenwood has written to me because she feels that the lessons learned by the rest of the world in recent years have been lost on Australia and Australians and she has written wanting her views expressed in her parliament. Mrs Watt writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As my representative in Parliament I hope you won't mind me writing to you over an issue which concerns me. I was pleased to hear that Sydney had won their bid to host the Olympic Games but was then saddened to see the response of the aboriginal people already demanding their own team and wanting to compete under their flag to promote their issues. I feel we should be competing as one nation&mdash;Australia&mdash;regardless of where we are from or our colour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For years Australia has decried the policies of South Africa but as they move towards breaking down the barriers we seem to be slowly but surely creating apartheid in Australia where we already have different rules for the populous and another for the aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To allow the aboriginal people to compete as a separate people under their own flag is only going to alienate them further. The Olympics should be a good opportunity to bring Australians together as one and really unite us to work together as a nation and not splinter groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope you will have the opportunity to express my views on these matters. I am sure many other Australians will feel the same.</PARA>
<PARA>The attitudes expressed by Mrs Watt are representative of the attitudes of average Australians around the country. Increasingly, we are struck down by the obvious differences and divisions emerging in Australia. Many of these divisions are sponsored by this government when it continues to deride average Australians by cutting them off at every corner with higher direct and indirect taxes, removing the incentive for hard work and long hours and, in the process, destroying the very character of Australia and Australians&mdash;the character which made this country a haven for refugees in wartime, a sanctuary for young men and women who were industrious, and a safe and congenial environment in which to raise families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Watt has spoken of the fears which seem to be increasing. In fact, they are beginning to become the day-to-day concern of many Australians. The danger of deep-rooted division, characteristic of other troubled countries, is slowly seeping to the surface of Australia's political and social culture. The warning signs are beginning to appear and they are echoed throughout Australia by average Australians like Mrs Watt who want the best for Australia and who want a united and tolerant Australia. </PARA>

<TITLE>Rural Land: Assets Test</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to raise an issue that is not peculiar to my electorate but one that is of significance to every rural and semirural electorate in Australia. I refer to the assets test on rural landowners for the purpose of determining eligibility for a pension. Currently two hectares, or five acres, of land can be included with the family home and not be counted as an asset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this may be considered generous by some, in many cases it is not practical. There are many senior citizens in rural Australia who live on more than five acres. They do not derive an income from their land, yet we force them to count anything over five acres as an asset. The truth is that it is a liability&mdash;a liability they cannot get rid of unless they sell their home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem is caused by the fact that local government and state laws often prevent subdivision of rural blocks to a two-hectare size. I have spoken to a number of rural residents who are being denied the pension they need because they are asset rich but income poor. By comparison, residents living in or adjacent to a city or a major growth area on a five-acre block of immense value do count that as part of their home. It is not counted as an asset and it therefore provides no impediment to such people being eligible for a pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that the assets test for pensioners is the most generous in the history of our nation. I realise that the level of the pension is the highest in real terms of any pension at any previous time in our history. That is one of the reasons I draw attention to this particular disadvantaged group. I am very pleased to see that the minister at the table is the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), who is in charge of this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when we are attempting to keep as many elderly people in their homes for as long as possible&mdash;keeping them in an environment where they feel comfortable and can be independent&mdash;we are telling one group of rural Australians that they must sell their home, if it is on more than five acres, and move to a smaller place if they need that pension. Yet I believe that there is a simple solution and I ask the minister to consider it urgently. The solution is that where people of pensionable age reside on a rural property, the part of that property considered as their home and not an asset is the smallest sized lot that can be subdivided under the state planning and local government legislation related to that land. In this way the government would be providing the necessary safety net that these people need. The decision to subdivide and sell would be theirs entirely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest to the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne) that if the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) does anything about that matter, he would certainly be the first from his side of politics to do so. The honourable member for Paterson could do no better than to look at what the coalition intended to do before the last election. He does not need to get this minister to investigate it; he should get him to take up the opposition's policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to talk about something that is not spoken about terribly often in this place&mdash;something positive that is happening in the region of Ballarat. Honourable members will be fully aware of the extraordinary difficulties that this region has been going through over the past 10 years, especially over the past three or four years. I am pleased to say that a positive air is now permeating the whole region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very good reason for that is that Ballarat people are extremely resilient. We have stood there with our heads held high, and we are now starting to reap the rewards. For instance, the Mars company has expanded recently. Containers Ltd, which had the choice of going overseas or relocating to Ballarat, is moving up from Melbourne&mdash;in my view, a very wise choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government has now given full university status to Ballarat University College, which is extraordinarily exciting for us. The state government also decided a couple of months ago that an information technology centre will be located in Ballarat, where a large amount of government work will be out-sourced. Our new library and an aquatic centre are presently under construction. Indeed, these are all adding to a very positive feeling in my region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the DEET figures for the March quarter and see that the region has an unemployment level of 18.4 per cent, we appreciate that something positive very desperately needs to happen. To be competitive Ballarat businesses and regional centres throughout the country rely upon transport and telecommunications&mdash;indeed, communications in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geelong has been fortunate enough to be linked into the Melbourne network. If it has not happened now, I believe it will happen soon. I plead with the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) to extend that opportunity to Ballarat. The telecommunications cost disadvantage is dramatically impacting upon the competitive position of regional centres right throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue&mdash;I am sorry to get back to the budget debate&mdash;is the cost of transport.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) is running around this country with committee after committee, but he was party to an increase in transport costs that significantly impact on only one group: the people in regional and rural Australia. I am absolutely amazed that government members, including the honourable member for Paterson, were not screaming blue murder about this, because they come in here night after night in the adjournment debate and get stuck into the opposition. But we have not heard one single word about this. They lay doggo on this issue. I can assure those opposite that the retribution will be taken out in late 1995, or early 1996, because they have let these people down. Labor Party backbenchers who pretend to have any interest in regional Australia have cooked their goose. This is one issue where they could have stood up but neglected to do so. They know as well as I do that every kilometre they get out of Melbourne, Sydney or the major capital centres, the impact of that fuel tax escalates all the way through. The further out we get, the further the impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite are serious about regional development, they will say to their minister, `Enough is enough'. They should address the telecommunications aspect, the cost of transport and that extraordinary disincentive to regional centres to get on with what they and I well know they want to do&mdash;to be competitive, create jobs and get back to the position where they can provide the help that is desperately required. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to draw to the attention of the House a matter of most serious concern to me as an elected representative in this honourable House. I trust that at the conclusion of this short speech a majority of honourable members will feel the same serious concern that I do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the proposal to make 100 officers of the Australian National Audit Office redundant and replace them with contractors from outside government. I believe that this is the beginning of the end of the audit office. I believe all honourable members will receive a most worrying letter from Wendy Caird, the acting National Secretary of the PSU. I know many members will secretly groan about another whingeing letter from a union secretary, but the matters raised clearly transcend such unfair bigotry and reaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the supporters of the proposal will say that, if the contractors bomb out, their contract can be cancelled and not renewed. Clearly, when all the damage is done we can try to take remedial action. That is not good enough, not safe enough and not responsible enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will lose expertise, corporate memory, management responsibility and control over unethical practices. There will be a loss of public accountability, and there could be a clear conflict of interest. The very contractors we are to start paying with taxpayers' money are the same groups who have been absolutely discredited by their appalling and unashamed behaviour in the 1980s. Who will ever forget their errors? We are still paying for them and will for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PSU, very properly, not only has raised concerns and criticisms but also has produced a very thoughtful, constructive and comprehensive submission; and I will be seeking leave to table a copy of this submission for the information of all honourable members. I am so concerned at this yet unbelievable attack on a very important section of the federal Public Service that I want to quickly quote some of the audit office's achievements: additional revenue of $100 million from fringe benefits tax; savings of $25 million over 10 years in the Overseas Property Group; savings of up to $7 million each year through more rigorous application of guidelines approved by this House; and savings of $5 million through better management and training of purchasing staff in various departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Administrative practice improvements have been many: the tenuous links between war service and disability and the need for fundamental review of the repatriation compensation legislation and the opportunities available to manipulate the environmental impact assessment process of the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. These are just a few of them. I am sure that when honourable members read the submission from the PSU they will consider that some action should be taken by members to ensure that the service remains. Other improvements have related to the inadequate protection of the Commonwealth against loss in constructing the new Collins class submarines and to legislation deficiencies at the Health Insurance Commission in combating fraud and excessive servicing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has any honourable member heard the audit office being congratulated on the achievements I have just outlined? Of course not. Everything is hidden to justify the great sell-off of the Public Service to an unacceptable group of contractors who would come to the taxpayer table with dirty hands and minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the House, the opposition and the government, to support the proper requests of the PSU for a full inquiry into the ANAO where we, the representatives of the taxpayer, can investigate, probe, question and then report to this forum&mdash;the people's forum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the two minutes remaining I refer to the progressive dismantling of the Melbourne City Council by the Kennett government, adding on key commercial areas and moving major residential areas from the council area. A clear gerrymander is involved and it is designed to give control of the Melbourne City Council to the major city business interests. It has removed the strongest independent residents area of the council, namely, the North Carlton area; removed the strongest Labor area, the Flemington-Kensington area; and provided two votes per business rather than the previous single vote. The new boundaries are absurd. Macaulay Road is a boundary&mdash;that is the main street in the suburb of Kensington&mdash;so Kensington has been split in half. Princes Park, which has been a major source of complaints from residents in the area, is now in the Melbourne City Council area and the residents on the other side of the road from Princes Park are now in the municipality of Fitzroy.
