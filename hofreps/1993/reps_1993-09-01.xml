<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As stated by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) in his second reading speech on 18 August, most of the amendments contained in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 flow from recommendations made by the commissioners of ATSIC in February 1993 following their review of the act. The coalition supports the thrust of these proposed changes. After all, they respond to a number of concerns expressed by the opposition parties in relation to the conduct and accountability of regional councils.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also broadly reflect sentiments contained in the coalition's policy at the last federal election which, among other things, signalled the importance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation in the decisions that affect their lives and determine their local priorities, and the intention to decentralise the ATSIC operations and devolve to the maximum extent possible its administrative decision making to the regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy on ATSIC also expresses an absolute requirement for focus on tangible benefits on the ground as a result of programs rather than the present focus on timely distribution of funds. It also has a requirement for the decision making to be open and transparent for organisations receiving government money to provide services in an efficient and equitable manner, and accountability in all levels of service delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment bill is the second in a three-part legislative package. The minister has advised that the third package of amendments will be introduced later in the sittings and will deal with arrangements for the Torres Strait and with streamlining the financial provisions of the principal act. It will also grant the Office of Evaluation and Audit powers to evaluate and audit regional councils, Aboriginal hostels, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation, and ATSIC funded corporations. While the coalition will certainly look to this third legislative package with a great deal of interest, I will be concentrating solely on the measures before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal act currently allows regional councils to establish advisory committees to provide advice in relation to the performance of their functions. Such an advisory committee may include members of the regional councils. The proposal will entitle future members of the advisory committees to receive remuneration and allowances for their services, and provides that such members will hold office on terms and conditions determined by ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment will also strengthen the obligations and guidelines for regional councillors. It will impose on regional councillors and advisory committee members the requirement for declaration of pecuniary interest in any matter that is being or about to be considered. Declarations of pecuniary interest must be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provisions add to the list of circumstances that make a person ineligible to stand for election or be elected as a member of a regional council. Again directly relating to regional council operations is the setting of a global limit on remuneration and allowances payable to members of the advisory committees, regional councils and other office holders under the ATSIC act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This move means that, once the amount paid in remuneration equals the set limit, no further remuneration will be payable during the period in which the limit applies. Such a tightening-up of funding arrangements is welcome by the coalition in light of the increased ability that it will afford regional councils to manage their budget and expenditure allocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes in relation to electoral boundaries will enable the introduction of a ward system for regional council elections and allow for the reduced number of regional councils. The introduction of a system of electoral wards is, as I understand it, a measure in response to concerns that the reduction in the number of regional councils might lessen the opportunity for representation by minority groups. Such a system is not unlike the ward system for local government elections in operation in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of wards, the coalition particularly notes the minister's advice about the future establishment of an electoral review panel and a process to assess and review the operations of regional council and ward boundaries. The coalition will look to the results of this review to ensure that it is indeed delivering the degree of fair representation of minority groups it is intended to provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other provisions in the bill allow for the election of a part-time deputy chairperson and a part-time alternate to the deputy chairperson of regional councils; a clearer definition of suspension, removal and acting arrangements for councillors; and empower the minister to determine what constitutes misbehaviour to ensure that councillors fully appreciate their responsibilities. Finally, there is provision in this bill for the deferral of the 1993 regional council elections in the Torres Strait islands to bring them into line with elections due under Queensland's Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition parties appreciate the necessity for the smooth passage of this bill to enable the institution of measures vital to the ATSIC elections to be held in early December 1993. We have considered all the measures which, as acknowledged earlier, respond to a number of concerns for accountability and effective monitoring of federal funding through ATSIC. It is recognised that these measures make provisions for increased accountability and strengthen the ability of ATSIC to monitor its own affairs. However, notwithstanding our recognition of these genuine moves to respond to accountability concerns in so far as ATSIC is concerned, there are further question marks which the coalition sees hanging over the $1 billion-plus annual funding now directed to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs; funding which aims to reverse the great disadvantage which currently besets the majority of indigenous Australians. We have to ask the question: what progress are we making?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent report on maternal deaths in Australia in 1988-90 stated that the incidence of direct deaths amongst Aboriginal women was the highest since 1972. Today, 20 years on, the incidence of maternal death for Aboriginal women through pregnancy and childbirth is eight times higher than for non-Aboriginal women. As recently as one month ago, the federal Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, was moved to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whatever we've been doing has been inadequate and we must do more and I intend, for my part to do more.</PARA>
<PARA>Just over a month ago, at a tropical diseases conference in Darwin, Dr Christine Phillips highlighted research from central Australia in which 374 Aboriginal people with diagnosed diabetes were monitored between 1984 and 1991. During that seven-year period, a staggering 130 of them&mdash;60 men and 70 women&mdash;had died. Another report, by Professor John Mathews, Director of the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin, told the same conference that nearly all rural Aboriginal infants at six weeks of age were permanently infected with harmful bacteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister may well be able to substantiate his claim, published in the budget related paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Social justice for indigenous Australians 1993-94</EMPHASIS>, that in the last 20 years there has been a reduction of 60 per cent in infant and maternal deaths and a reduction in the impact of many infectious diseases. We can claim that for the non-indigenous population also. The real bottom line in examining all these performance indicators is that, in relation to the rest of the Australian population, the figures for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians show them to be a seriously disadvantaged group. This is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that federal funding allocated to address the abysmal living standards of a large number of Aboriginal people in Australia still is not hitting the mark. It is therefore as an expression of deep concern that I move, on behalf of the coalition, the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of this bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes the Government's own admission that Aboriginal wellbeing is not improving and therefore calls for an independent review of ATSIC to determine the measures necessary to ensure an improvement in its performance in order to significantly lift the living standards of the indigenous population of Australia".</PARA>
<PARA>I must stress that this amendment is not introduced as an ATSIC bashing exercise, but as a move which ATSIC should welcome and support. The information which can flow from the independent and transparent review must surely provide us with some strong guideposts as to where we have come and where we are headed in this crucial area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is aware of the criticisms directed towards ATSIC; most notable is the recent expressions by Ms Pat O`Shane who said, `On every social indicator the position of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders has deteriorated over the past decade in the lifetime of ATSIC'. This is not fair or balanced criticism on any count. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 was proclaimed on 7 February 1990. ATSIC commenced operations on 5 March 1990, just 3 1/2 years ago. Ms O'Shane should check her facts. At that time, ATSIC's statement of purpose was that it would work towards the achievement of a situation of justice and equity in the longer term where Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders have sufficient economic and social status to enjoy fundamental civil, social, and economic rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While appreciating the recognition in this statement of the long-term view, it has opened up a question as to whether vital areas such as health and housing should be the sole responsibility of ATSIC. This question has also been put to the shadow Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), during his recent travels to various Aboriginal communities around Australia. Professor John Mathews, whom I quoted earlier, also made this point recently: `We know that chronic bronchitis and damaged lungs in later life are a sequel to childhood infections that aren't treated properly. These bacterial infections undermine a person's health later in life. Death rates from pneumonia in people with damaged lungs are very high in middle age and that is probably a consequence of what's happened in childhood'. The yardstick by which one measures the effectiveness of programs, particularly health programs, is also significant. The 10 years offered as a yardstick by Ms O'Shane is, I believe, an unrealistic indicator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further sad commentary on all this lies with Professor Mathews' two statements quoted previously. The prognosis for today's six-week-old rural Aboriginal infants who are permanently infected with harmful bacteria will be realised in their middle age. This is a national shame, and it requires a national effort to combat it. The coalition welcomes the health minister's interest in becoming involved, and it has no reason to doubt that he is genuinely anxious to do something tangible about the poor living standards of indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I remind the House that the coalition's policy on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders emphasises the need for clearly defined objectives for the achievement and improvement in Aboriginal health, in the provision of housing and infrastructure, in Aboriginal education, and in Aboriginal economic development. Benchmarks must be set for assessing these four practical and vital indicators of human wellbeing  and quality of life. The coalition believes it is essential that an independent review be made of the ability of the ATSIC structure to realistically deal with the multifarious demands required to be met to reduce the disadvantages of Australia's indigenous peoples. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. This legislation furthers the reform process of the ATSIC political structure, particularly as it applies in the regions. This legislation advances the effectiveness and integrity of this body, both within and outside the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. ATSIC has built an impressive record over its three years of operation. This legislation will enable the political and administrative arms of the commission to operate much more efficiently in achieving its aims and objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for all honourable members to appreciate that this is very much an evolving process of self-determination and self-management by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia. When the original ATSIC legislation was enacted, the concept of giving the power to Aboriginal and Islander people to determine their own priorities and manage their own affairs was a new idea for non-indigenous Australia. Many thought it would not work. There was much scepticism and some fierce opposition from some sections of the Aboriginal community as well as others in the political spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC had a very stormy gestation and its birth was difficult. The decision by many to boycott the first elections for regional councillors and commissioners did not cause stillbirth as some had hoped. Three years later we have a healthy developing organisation that grows stronger, wiser and more proficient with each passing day. There are of course many things still to learn and many improvements that can be made to strengthen the decision making processes and to provide greater control over funding decisions in regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In using the analogy of the birth and growth of a child to describe the evolving development of ATSIC, I do not seek in any way to be patronising or paternalistic in my approach to the process of self-determination for Aboriginal and Islander Australians. Far from it. I am strongly committed to advancing the process of self-government for indigenous people. Rather, I seek to emphasise that all of us&mdash;members of the parliament and the government, workers in the bureaucracy both in ATSIC and in other departments, Aboriginal and Islander people and the rest of the Australian population&mdash;are on a sharp learning curve in shaping this new concept within our political and administrative structures. It is a radical new concept, untried anywhere else in the world in the fashion of our model, and all participants in the process need time to grow with it and to reshape it as it evolves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC does have limitations. It has made some mistakes over the past three years. There are still areas where improvements are required. Many Aboriginal and Islander people do get frustrated with some of the bureaucratic processes that are used. Many would like to have a lot more control now over some of the national programs and over expenditure on Aboriginal needs done by other departments. But all of these issues will be worked through and will be improved if we keep our eye on the long-term objective and do not allow ourselves to be sidetracked or become short sighted or too desperate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that a quorum was called because I was just about to praise the opposition for the role it played in Aboriginal and Islander affairs. I might have to withdraw those words. In the last three years a hallmark of Aboriginal and Islander administration has been the spirit of cooperation between the government and the opposition. Unfortunately, that spirit of cooperation has not been demonstrated in the House today through those opposite interrupting people who are trying to make some very important points on a very important area of public administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The task for ATSIC over the first three years of its existence has been to shape a political and bureaucratic structure which enables Aboriginal and Islander people to determine their needs and priorities and to target resources to those needs with strategic programs that they are responsible for. That task has been made much easier by the cooperation and support of the opposition in this parliament. I acknowledge the very important role the former opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), played in achieving this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the continuation of that policy under the wise counsel of my friend, who is absent, the current opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent). Too often in the past, the administration of Aboriginal and Islander affairs has been used for cheap point scoring and very destructive political agendas. A great deal of hysteria had been built up among the non-Aboriginal Australian community about allegations of gross mismanagement, corruption, excessive waste of resources and accusations that indigenous Australians were being given unfair advantages in the allocation of government support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These continuing allegations built up considerable tensions, caused significant disruption to the administration of Aboriginal needs and led to racism and abuses of the rights of many indigenous people. Those processes have very much diminished in the past three years. We have been able to operate in a much more cooperative and cohesive way in tackling the isolated examples of waste or mismanagement without the climate of hysteria and hatred that existed previously. The positive relationships between the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and his opposition counterparts have been a significant factor in this achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other very important factor in achieving constructive reform in the administration of Aboriginal affairs has been the excellent leadership provided by the Chairperson of ATSIC, Ms Lois O'Donoghue. Lois is a woman of outstanding character, ability and compassion. She has overseen the establishment and development of the new commission with determination and intellectual rigour, and also with personal qualities of calmness, sincerity and understanding of the complexities of the needs of the individuals for whose welfare she is responsible. I do not believe ATSIC would have had the stature it has today without Lois's contribution as chairperson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my role as Chairperson of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs I have had the opportunity to meet numerous representatives of Aboriginal and Islander community organisations and members of a number of ATSIC regional councils around Australia. Their views and experiences have provided me and my committee colleagues with valuable insights into the workings of ATSIC, the issues of concern and the areas where further improvements are needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without wishing to pre-empt the final report of the standing committee in its current inquiry into the access and equity strategy, I would like to outline some of the ways in which Aboriginal and Islander people believe ATSIC needs to be further strengthened. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) goes to the very essence of the problem ATSIC has. There is a misconception in the Australian community, within both the indigenous and non-indigenous populations, that ATSIC is responsible for the totality of Aboriginal affairs. That misconception is creating enormous problems for ATSIC and Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Aboriginal people turn up at ATSIC regional offices expecting ATSIC to be able to help them with a whole host of areas that it does not have responsibility for. The fact is that mainstream government departments&mdash;whether we are talking about the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, the Department of Employment, Education and Training or the CES; whatever department we might be talking about at the Commonwealth, state or local government level&mdash;have prime responsibility for delivering services to Aboriginal people as well as to other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I do not believe that those departments are delivering those services in the way they should. The problem we face is that many government departments and indigenous Australians think that ATSIC is responsible for everything. It is not, and it would not be able to achieve all of those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a view and a wish amongst Aboriginal people on ATSIC's regional councils that they should have a much greater say in the way in which these other mainstream departments deliver their services, but that is not currently the case. They do not have a say in the way in which the Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing and Community Services delivers its services to Aboriginal people; they do not have any say in the way in which state housing commissions might allocate housing to Aboriginal and urban communities where Aboriginal people might live; they do not have a say in the way in which state health departments provide hospitals and other community health services to Aboriginal people as well as to other Australians. Those are the areas where we have great problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a misconception to be blaming ATSIC for the fact that we have not been able to make significant inroads into health and education issues for Aboriginal people. ATSIC's responsibility is to complement mainstream government departments. It is there to top up. It is there to identify where there are some specific areas of neglect from those mainstream departments and to put some extra money in to help those communities. It is not there to provide prime services. It is there to give a voice to Aboriginal and Islander people so that they can identify their needs in that area, and to say to those mainstream departments, `This is what you should be doing. This is the major area of concern that we have in our area, and we have real health problems'. That is clearly understood by the government and the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are incredibly poor health statistics for the Aboriginal and Islander people in this country. But it is not ATSIC's responsibility to do the job alone. ATSIC's responsibility is to work with those government departments at state, Commonwealth and local government levels in order to identify strategic ways in which to tackle those primary health problems. Officers of government departments have a responsibility in this area and they should be talking to ATSIC and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander political leaders in the community. They should be asking, `What strategies do we need to undertake together to achieve these improvements in health, education and housing needs?'. That is the real challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment, which calls for an inquiry into ATSIC, will not achieve that. We need to be talking about much greater levels of coordination and cooperation. We should be challenging the whole spectrum of government administration in this country and should appreciate the responsibility it has to the indigenous people of this country. We should be working with the indigenous people to tackle those issues. We should not blame ATSIC for the fact that we have not had the capacity to tackle primary health, education or employment needs. ATSIC is working very hard to identify the areas of need and put in place programs that will achieve improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the $800 million-odd that ATSIC has responsibility for spread across Australia, trying to tackle all of those needs is an impossible task. We have to start working together. The whole community has to appreciate the fact that ATSIC is now, and will be for quite a considerable time in the future, the political representative structure of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Everybody needs to recognise that and work with ATSIC. Let us stop the white-anting and the undermining of this structure. The Aboriginal and Islander people now have an effective voice. We should start using that effective voice and should be working together to tackle those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept the opposition's proposed amendment. I do not believe that it is a fair assessment to engage in some new study of whether ATSIC is effective or not, unless there is a determination by the opposition which says, `All these other government departments should give all of the funding that they are given in their portfolio departments to ATSIC to administer'. I do not think that will happen, and I do not think it should happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are Australians. They deserve their share of mainstream government expenditure on their needs. ATSIC's responsibility is to coordinate that service delivery in its regions. Where there are pockets of need that are not being addressed, ATSIC has to ensure that it comes in with a specific program and assists the Aboriginal organisations to work in the communities. That is the challenge that we have as a government, and that is the area where I believe we should be working in an effort to strengthen ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem that we have is that we still place much greater emphasis on accountability and examining where every single dollar is spent on Aboriginal affairs than we do on any other government department. Aboriginal expenditure is still put under the microscope much more closely than any other government expenditure. It is about time that we stopped this abuse of our responsibility for accountability&mdash;targeting Aboriginal programs over and above the way in which we generally supervise administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that every dollar we spend on Aboriginal affairs should not be accounted for and that expenditure should not be supervised. I am a strong believer in accountability of government expenditure. But I do not believe that Aboriginal programs should be placed under more scrutiny&mdash;incredible scrutiny&mdash;than other government departments. We are spending an inordinate amount of time satisfying those accountability procedures and not spending sufficient time addressing the real needs&mdash;fixing up health problems, housing problems, giving people a real educational opportunity and giving people a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where we want the money to go. We must identify that as our real challenge, instead of placing enormous microscopic scrutiny on every single dollar that is spent on Aboriginal affairs. That accountability demand is placing enormous pressure on Aboriginal organisations. We do not give them the skills to satisfy those accountability procedures, but we demand that every cent be accounted for and that they go through an enormous bureaucratic process to satisfy government audit requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 2) is part of an evolutionary process for ATSIC. It is giving a bit more power to the regional councils. It is tidying up a few problems that have been identified in the last three years. It is part of an ongoing process that I think we are going to be going through for the next 20 or 30 years in this place: that is, making minor amendments as needs emerge, as Aboriginal and Islander people raise with us their needs for further change in the political structure. This parliament and the people of Australia have to recognise that ATSIC is here to stay. Our challenge is to make ATSIC a very strong and effective organisation and to give it the skills to work with all the other government departments to achieve its real objective. That will lead to a massive improvement in the quality of life for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 2), I do so with some deep grief and disappointment at what has happened in Queensland. Over 30 per cent of Australia's people of Aboriginal descent live in Queensland&mdash;arguably over 40 per cent of people of Aboriginal descent live in Queensland. In the history of Queensland there has only been one change of government in 100 years. For the first 60 of those 100 years the Australian Labor Party was in office. That was the party of socialism and humanity. Let us look at the record of the laws that existed in Queensland when the Liberal-National Party coalition took office in 1957. A person of Aboriginal descent who worked for a wage did not have his wage paid to him; it was paid to the Director of Native Affairs whose local officers were the police officers. The Aboriginal worker had to go along and speak to the police officers and tell them what he wanted the money for and they would give him sufficient money to cover that particular need. I leave to the imagination of the members of the House how pleasant that function would be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a mustering camp or droving trip finished, everyone went and drank some of their earnings at the hotel. But of course the black ringer could not, firstly, because he would not have any money; and, secondly, because black people in the state of Queensland were not allowed to drink in hotels by law. So when a droving trip finished, the whites would go to the pub together as mates but the black people would be excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In each town in Queensland we had what were affectionately known as blacks' camps. They were a disgrace to the people of Australia, to the governments of Queensland and, most certainly, to the towns in which they existed&mdash;which was most of the towns in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst law of all was the removal order. An officer of the Department of Native Affairs could simply pluck someone of Aboriginal or part-Aboriginal descent off the street&mdash;at the officer's whim and discretion, with no appeal system&mdash;and send that person to what was affectionately called a reserve. When a person went to a reserve, he was totally in the hands of and under the direction of the superintendent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Superintendent' was the word used in the act, and that same word was used in the act with respect to gaols in the state of Queensland. The superintendent on a reserve had powers similar to the superintendent of a gaol, except that the powers of the former were more extensive. He could give an order&mdash;the act did not specify what the order could be; it could be `brush my shoes' or `mow my lawn' or any order whatsoever&mdash;and if that order was disobeyed the person so ordered could be punished. In fact, the superintendent could punish that person in any event; he could, at his discretion and without any appeal, impose a punishment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member, who has been in Queensland for two minutes and who is supposed to represent more black people than anyone else in Australia, has asked what we did. Every single one of those laws was wiped off the books within 3 1/2 years of our coming to office in Queensland. It took previous governments 60 years to reduce those people to the most dreadful conditions of any people living on earth. The party of the honourable member for Leichhardt did that; it was part of the White Australia policy. The attitudes of the honourable member's party were reflected in every single aspect of the legislation in Queensland. I understand why the honourable member does not know about it&mdash;not only does he enjoy a reputation for being a bit lacking above the shoulders, but also he has only been in the state for two minutes. But the people of Cairns will of course be made aware of this in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me move on. Within 3 1/2 years, every single one of those pernicious, dreadful pieces of legislation was wiped off the books. That is a pretty good effort in 3 1/2 years&mdash;to turn around nearly 70 years of degradation imposed upon those people by the ALP in the state of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we took government in Queensland I can remember that the local picture theatre had a steel bar. The black people sat behind the steel bar while the white people sat in front of it. That was Queensland when we took government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Johnny-come-lately to Queensland does not understand what happened in the last six years. He has not been there long enough. In the last six years, we decided to take two initiatives which were unique in Australia. One initiative was to give the people on the reserve areas in Queensland ownership of the seven million acres of those reserve areas. It is not ownership as in the Northern Territory, where nothing can take place on 50 per cent of the land without the matter being referred to the government in Canberra for permission. This is absolutely, completely fee simple. Maybe as a lawyer&mdash;and the honourable member for Leichhardt did not enjoy a very good reputation as a lawyer either, let me tell him&mdash;the honourable member would understand what fee simple means. It means freehold land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only difference between title and freehold land is that land title could not be sold to outsiders. The land could be sold only to community residents. Those residents for the first time had ownership that enabled them to get a mortgage from the banks. Without loans from the banks, no community can grow&mdash;whether it be the Australian community or a community at Kowanyama. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second initiative was to grant what the people call self-management&mdash;local government, as most of us would know it. As with everything else, the ALP claimed it was not self-management. There was a case&mdash;the R. v. Smallwood case&mdash;involving a gentleman who was a member of the land council at Yarrabah. It was decided in that case that proper, complete local government powers had been handed to the properly constituted Yarrabah community council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not quite true because far more extensive powers were granted to the councils. Those councils also had extensive control over the police force and various other activities. That was not because we were particularly in love with people of Aboriginal descent but because of the impossibility of properly administering places such as Kowanyama from 1,500 miles away in Brisbane&mdash;it was utterly impossible. One would get far better administration from the people on the ground in that place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been the great failure of ATSIC. Once again, we have government that is geographically and in every other way remote from the people. Problems of culture, education, language and communication skills have caused immense difficulties for the people of Aboriginal descent in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we handed over the land and, when we wanted to bury the land ownership, the ACC gave us a direction: `If you touch that then the sky will fall on you'. The Aboriginal people were so pleased with what they got that 4,000 people turned up at Yarrabah for the handing over of the deeds of grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As reported on the front of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS>, the old men cried. They cried two years later after the ALP took half of the Yarrabah reserve away from them. The death of the chairman of the Yarrabah council, Peter Noble, can be laid right at the feet of the ALP. That man took seriously the capture, the theft, the world heritage listing of half of the Yarrabah reserve. He came under such criticism that he found it difficult to cope. That, coupled with certain other matters, led Peter Noble to drive in such a reckless manner that all I can say to the members opposite is: `Thank you for the death of Peter Noble'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that was not the end of the story of land ownership in Queensland. The ALP won office. Black people in Queensland handed out how-to-vote cards, and they still do, because they have been deceived, as they have been for so much of their recent history. I do not get angry with them. I just feel terribly sad that these people are so deceived that they do not know what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be very particular in talking about the electorate of the honourable member for Leichhardt because the last time I was there Percy Neal said, `G'day, mate. What are you doing in town?'. I said, `You know, fooling around'. He said, `Come out and see us'. So we went out to the farm and I said, `Do you understand what has happened with the land ownership?'. He said, `We know. We own nothing now'. I said, `Well, aren't you going to do anything about it?'. He said, `What's the use? Old dad fought for 72 years for his land and we won the battle. Two years later they took half of it off us and then three years after the government that we stood in the hot sun and handed out how-to-vote cards for took the rest of it off us. So what's the use?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the situation in Queensland. The seven million acres are no longer owned by the land councils or in private ownership&mdash;because the councils had the machinery means to pass the land on to private ownership. All of that seven million acres is now owned by the government. The absolute towering stupidity of the eight white officials that drafted the legislation has been such that the only way the black people can get at that legislation is to prove tribal relationship. That is very helpful in Yarrabah because there are only about 50 people in a town with a population of 2,000 to 3,000 that are of the original tribe! At Cherbourg, there are about 12 from the original tribe. In fact, almost all of the reserves in Queensland have virtually none of the original members of the tribe on the land. So the legislation has not only taken the land away from these people in the short term but also ensures that the majority of the people living on the reserves can never have that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in the short term and even if one is a member of the original tribe, land ownership is still very difficult to prove because one has to mount a campaign in the courts and through legal tribunals, which of course lines the pockets of the Aboriginal legal aid lawyers who have parasited and bloodsucked off the people of Aboriginal descent in a most dreadful manner. The last legal aid lawyer in Mount Isa was being paid $72,000 a year, and I am told he could not get a job for $26,000 a year as an articled clerk in Melbourne. I do not know whether that is true but I am fairly certain it is, because he most certainly did not do too well when he got out of the job. </PARA>

We also know that the Mabo case was brought by the firm of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), whose Queensland agents were Goss Downey and Carne&mdash;the firm of Wayne Goss. So we know who are getting their pockets lined by the great legalists of this place in Aboriginal affairs in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me move on because, unfortunately, the case is much sadder than this. I tell this story to the House because it needs telling&mdash;it cuts at the very heart of Aboriginal affairs and highlights the difference between the paternalism of the socialists and the equal rights and responsibilities approach of our side of politics. This story graphically illustrates that difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a bloke trained up by my right hand, the deputy in the Department of Aboriginal affairs, Eric Law. This young man was trained up to go in and take over as the shire clerk at Weipa South. He did such a brilliant job that his efforts were brought to the attention of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>, which ran a program because for the first time in Australian history a group of people had decided to work voluntarily for the dole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is now known as CDEP was in fact started by this shire clerk with the community council at Weipa. He was brilliantly gifted and well trained for the job.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> 60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> got more laudatory letters than it had ever had before in its history&mdash;so much so that, for the only time in its history, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> did a follow-up program on what had taken place at Weipa because it set an example not only for black people in Australia but every Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some three or four months after this, I went up to Weipa. The young man was most inhospitable and non-communicative towards me. I said, `How are things going?'. He said, `Not much good'. I said, `Let me tell you what has happened. The ALP government in Canberra has sent up a white public servant who has come in as a development officer and is undermining you and taking control of the running of the council'. He said, `How did you know that?'. I said, `Because they've done it in every single community in Queensland. Our efforts to put real power in the hands of the black people and to force them, even if they don't want to, to make the decisions themselves are being undermined by another group of white parasites, the so-called do-gooders. And I tell you what: my experience is that the do-gooders have done bloody well for themselves, bloody well'. Excuse my language, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This young man, the white officer there, Darvel Long&mdash;this white parasite put in there by the ALP government, the socialists and the paternalists&mdash;started going to the shire chairman and saying, `This particular person doesn't really understand some things. You could get yourself into trouble here. I think I'd better take over the running of this function or that function'. As he started taking over the running of all of these functions, the confidence of the council in its own shire clerk was undermined more and more. Thanks to the degradation imposed upon these people by 70 years of ALP rule, these people do not have very high self-esteem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, the thinking was that, where administration was concerned, it would be better to get behind a white bloke than a black bloke. The end to this sad story is that when this particular person came back after a weekend he found that the computer code had been changed so that he could not access the computer for the shire council. His job became a farce and he resigned. That is the tragic end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the story of Aboriginal affairs throughout Australia. I hope that the people in ATSIC will fight to redress some of those wrongs because the existing structure is extremely poor when it comes to delivering the things that need to be delivered in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our policy created a situation in which only six of the 28 councils in Queensland attracted any bad report or comment from the Auditor-General. This year, of the 28 councils, only six did not have a bad report from the Auditor-General. In other words, whereas previously almost every council was doing its job as well as any shire council in Queensland, we now have a situation in which virtually not one is doing so because the accountability provisions were removed. Ultimately, the people of Australia will not respect them if there are no accountability provisions. That is the first point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that we directed that all houses in Queensland be built exclusively by black labour. That created 400 to 500 jobs for the structurally unemployed in the state of Queensland. That has been reversed and we are back to building prefabricated, rubbishy houses built by outside, white contractors. Consequently, 400 to 500 black jobs have gone up in smoke, and that is quite apart from the building of remarkably inappropriate homes. Further, the people have no land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be successful in modern society, people need the proper machinery&mdash;the modern machinery of government and economic enterprise. Collective ownership and cultural inheritance have been argued backwards and forwards by anthropologists until everyone's face was red. I think it is a moot point as to whether they have collective ownership or not. Nevertheless, we are not talking about the past. If we are going to enable these people to have a future then we must give them the machinery that will work in the future. That machinery is private ownership and private enterprise, just as it exists in Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the same machinery went into Yarrabah that went into Cairns there would be the same success story as we have seen with the Neals, the Connollys and all the other people who have been so successful in business. They might see themselves as having had a bit of a battle but what small businessmen in Australia today do not have a battle?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remarkable success stories that we have seen are now reversing at a hundred miles an hour because of the hypocrisy of the government&mdash;a government that bit the hand that fed it in such a dreadful way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Neville Bonner said, the money allocated for blacks in Australia ends up in white pockets. One university study indicated that 60 per cent of that money ended up in white pockets.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he really believed his rhetoric he would support this legislation and not the spurious amendment that has been put forward calling for some sort of review of ATSIC which is really an attack on ATSIC, its commissioners and those people in the regional councils who work tirelessly and, prior to the introduction of this legislation, without any reward. In fact, it is an attack on the very Aboriginal people who voted for him. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I do know is that this bill further enhances self-determination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia. The section 26 review which brought about the changes provides proof of this. I travel among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities more than most members of this House. The message that I get, which has been put by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), is that there are problems with ATSIC; people do concede that. After all, as the honourable member for Moreton said, it is not an organisation that has been with us for very long. When one asks Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, `Okay, there are problems with ATSIC; do you want to go back to the old DAA days?', they say, `Oh, no, we don't want that at all'.

<PARA>If that is not a criticism of ATSIC's accountability, then I do not know what is. This bill enhances the accountability of ATSIC.

But I must emphasise&mdash;and it is very important for the House to note&mdash;that in future, the intention is that the ward system and those boundaries be determined by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves. The only reason that that is not introduced in this legislation is the time factor that is involved in the section 26 review. We are then faced with the next elections.

I was disturbed to hear evidence in all three places that ATSIC regional councils are still having problems with some federal, state and local government agencies. For the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Commission to work, the power of the parliament has to be vested in the regional councils, and this must be recognised by all levels of government. I believe the provisions in the bill passed earlier this year, along with the reforms in this bill, will help strengthen the role of regional councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first bill included provisions dealing with two of the recommendations of the Aboriginal and Torres Islander Commission relating to regional councils. The regional council structure was strengthened by reducing the numbers of councils. As at the next round of elections due later this year, the number of regional councils will be reduced from 60 to 36. This will be achieved by providing for full-time appointments of regional council chairpersons. Therefore, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in my electorate will participate in the ATSIC election process for the Queensland far north and communities regional council, the Queensland north regional council and the Torres Strait regional council. Because the act requires that regional council elections be held before the end of this year, it is essential that those who wish to stand for election are aware of the new rules that will govern the elections and operations of the regional councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time that I have to speak, I do not intend to comment on every other clause of the bill, but I want to draw the attention of honourable members of the House to the reforms in the bill that will have a particular impact in my electorate. As honourable members of this House are aware, my electorate stretches from Cairns to the Torres Strait and to our only international border which is with Papua New Guinea. I have the pleasure of having regular contact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in the Cape York Peninsula, the Torres Strait, Yarrabah and in and around the city of Cairns itself. I believe that the current regional councils are deservedly going down in history as trailblazers for the cause of self-determination within ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult for honourable members who come from suburban electorates to imagine the difficulties. The honourable member for Kennedy referred to the difficulties that people in remote areas have in dealing with bureaucracies thousands of kilometres away in Brisbane or Cairns. The demolition of that southern based power has been very important for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Far North Queensland. That is especially so after the decades of control of every aspect of their lives by successive Queensland governments up to 1989, including the government in which the honourable member for the Kennedy was a minister. In this context, the empowerment of regional councils in Far North Queensland has been quite remarkable. I am confident that this package of amendments will further improve the ability of councillors to serve their constituents in the far north. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When introducing the first package of amendments to the act, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Affairs announced that a series of workshops will be held to discuss the proposed changes, and one of the key matters to be discussed will be the offer of introducing a ward system. I am assured that there is widespread support for this idea. Again, it is very important to note that, in remote areas, distinct areas should get distinct representation. This legislation provides that. Given the level of support for the idea, as I have already indicated there will be a provision in the legislation for the subdivision of wards in time for this year's regional council elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, in supporting this bill, I would again like to praise those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in my electorate, and in the whole of Australia, who have worked diligently and, up until now, without any proper remuneration or compensation on regional councils and at a commissioner level. It is their work that has put ATSIC in the position it is in now. It is their work that I praise, and for that reason I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very encouraged in speaking for this amendment for two reasons. The first reason is fact the changes outlined within the amendment are an example of the continuing concern that the coalition has for the indigenous people of Australia. The second reason is a personal one and that is that I truly care. Unlike some of the chardonnay socialists opposite, I have a track record in this particular area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The indigenous people of Australia have rights in this country. They have the right to have a proper health service provided to them. They have a right to access and equity to mainstream government services, yet evidence supports that they are not provided such access. They have a right to lead their lives without the input of paternalistic non-Aboriginal Australians, which holds back the development of their own culture and values. Frankly, the enormity of the current social issues disturbing the indigenous people are awesome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our priorities need to be focused on facilitating solutions for the community which it will accept and thus adopt. It is significant that the Labor Party is supporting coalition policy on this issue and has come to realise the need to show compassion for this very important issue. Wherever possible, we must work for bipartisan agreement on policies for the indigenous people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1992 the coalition first brought to the attention of the government the need to introduce the amendments outlined in this bill. The coalition, in its white paper of that year, noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently there are 60 regional councils in Australia. This is an impossible number of councils to be adequately serviced by ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, we foretold the current problems. The white paper continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the regional councils are to become the prime decision making body at program and project level it is essential that they have the best people on them and are adequately resourced and adequately serviced. The reduction in the number of regional councils is absolutely essential to ATSIC's future success and the implementation of these proposals. The smaller number of regional councils will allow those regional councils to be better serviced by existing ATSIC regional offices.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, the coalition had flagged the need for revision of the management structure, and the government, to its rare credit, is taking up the advice we provided. It is no surprise that the major concern for many Australians is the use and misuse of public funds provided for ATSIC and whether those fund are bringing important advancements to the Aboriginal people. Although the reality is very different to community perceptions, it seems that the use of government money is being questioned by the community generally. As an example, the McCarrey report, released in the Western Australian parliament recently, reinforced the concerns of the community. The McCarrey report was a sad inditement of the performance of the Labor administration in that state over the last 10 years, and confirmed the ALP as a poor financial manager&mdash;as, I guess, budgets one and two have indicated this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note what it said about Aboriginal expenditure and operations. The report noted that government Aboriginal programs in Western Australia, both federal and state, were poorly administered, inappropriate and failed comprehensively to address underlying issues of the indigenous communities. In 1992-93, total federal and state expenditure in Western Australia was $288 million in addition to the $380 million associated with other mainstream Aboriginal programs. Despite these programs and the funds expended, the report was damning in stating that a broad range of social and economic statistics show that, despite these programs, Aborigines remain disadvantaged. The question then has to be: is ATSIC living up to the high expectations placed upon it by indigenous Australians and the wider community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same report stated that the welfare approach was ineffective and that governments should concentrate on the social and economic advancement of indigenous people. The most damning point of the report was that only one-third of the huge amount of $668 million spent on Aboriginal people by Western Australian government programs was spent on the social and economic advancement of Aboriginal people&mdash;only one-third. Why, and what can we do about it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring the attention of the House to two recommendations from the report, which the government would do well to recognise. Firstly, the federal government should negotiate with the state government to allow the state government to manage ATSIC programs and their delivery. Secondly, it should encourage local government to become more involved in service delivery of mainstream services, community management and employment issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These initiatives deserve consideration by the government in the development of access and equity programs for indigenous people and it is incumbent on the ATSIC management to seek solutions and facilitate these recommendations. If we use Western Australia as an example, the geographic diversity of the Aboriginal communities necessitates an approach that is flexible and able to effectively and competently meet the diverse and changing needs of the many varied communities of indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, the 41,000 indigenous people are spread widely throughout the state with 28 per cent living in the metropolitan area, 38 per cent living in rural communities and 34 per cent scattered throughout remote locations. To reach the indigenous people in Western Australia a diverse planning approach is required from suburban to remote services requiring attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What truly saddens me about the current management of indigenous people issues&mdash;it affects me because there are some 1,500 Aboriginal constituents in Cowan, some of which are the most disadvantaged in Western Australia&mdash;is the continuing and alarming evidence that despite the abundant funding provided to ATSIC, equivalent to around $17,000 for every Aboriginal in Western Australia, the indigenous people remain tremendously disadvantaged. What is ATSIC doing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particular Aboriginal issue important to me and the wider Aboriginal community is the issue of Aboriginal health. It can be considered that the current Aboriginal community has a mortality rate greater than a war zone as exists in some of the areas around the world at the moment. The community is actually at war with some of these health issues. Last week during my visits to Aboriginal communities with a few of my more compassionate colleagues of the other side we had discussions with many Aboriginal leaders. The biggest issue raised was that of health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we must remain cautious about imposing our paternalistic white man value structures, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) so readily wishes to do, we must recognise the importance of the need to provide a sustained and realistic health standard for the Aboriginal community, which should be non-negotiable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we continue to ignore the crisis of health within the Aboriginal community, the guilt of which the Prime Minister often speaks will surely fall upon those current governments that have the power to act yet do not and those ATSIC managers who wash their hands of any responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a recent speech to the House, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) addressed the urgent need for the government to address the health issues within our indigenous communities. In that speech, the honourable member for Chisholm stated that there is a `reservoir of untreated sexually transmitted disease' in the communities and that no government agency is strategically looking at these issues. In particular, he spoke of the need for AIDS awareness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week in Darwin we were told of the first instance of a heterosexual male Aborigine having been diagnosed as contracting the AIDS virus. It is a concern to the Department of Health in Darwin, as it should be to everyone in the Australian community, that the AIDS virus is about to expand within the Aboriginal community. What is ATSIC doing about this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Chisholm said further that health should not be a political issue, for Aboriginal communities and all those associated with delivering services to these communities have a duty of care to lift themselves above petty politics and address the real issues. It seems the most important issue relating to health is not being planned, managed or seemingly acted upon to find or even just facilitate solutions, yet we spend millions of dollars. What is ATSIC doing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current mortality rate within the Aboriginal community is about three times higher than the rest of the community. Infant mortality reflects these figures. Absolutely no-one should accept these figures. We as a community should demand a greater return for the funds provided for these issues. It is just not good enough for the ever wringing of hands and the buck-passing of departments given the responsibility to address these issues. It requires leadership and action. Just what is ATSIC doing about it? We have the technology, we have the medical skill and we have the people capable, but do we have the political will to facilitate action? It would appear not, despite what the Prime Minister says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy in regard to indigenous people is quite clear. The priority given to health issues is reflected in the coalition's policy on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. The coalition's policy identified the improvement of Aboriginal health as the most important objective of any future coalition government. I support the amendment because it endorses coalition policy and will allow the ATSIC management structure to more effectively provide for the self-determining services the Aboriginal community demands. I commend the amendment to the House. </PARA>

The members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs&mdash;I see another member of the committee in the House&mdash;have shared a great deal of bipartisan support. However, since the honourable member for Cowan has raised these very serious health issues and has asked what ATSIC is doing, I ask him what the Northern Territory government is doing about these health issues. It is in receipt of considerable moneys from the Commonwealth government to provide equitably health services to all Australians. That is one of the issues of considerable concern to our committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 2). I am not prepared to support the second reading amendment moved by the opposition because I believe it will deflect important resources from ATSIC at a crucial time in its development. Unfortunately, it could lead to a witch-hunt rather than to an effective outcome. In fact, I contend that ATSIC is required to be more accountable than other government departments, given the politics of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) said in his second reading speech, the package is a careful balance between the goals of self-determination and self-management with strong accountability requirements supported by the parliament, ATSIC and the regional councils. It needs to be remembered that ATSIC is a recent innovation&mdash;part of this government's commitment to the indigenous people of this country. ATSIC combines representative, policy making and administrative elements into one organisation. It aims to involve indigenous Australians in participation and decision making in our programs and policies that affect them. A document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Social Justice for Indigenous Australians 1993-94</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social justice, empowerment and accountability are the foundations on which Commonwealth policy on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs is built.</PARA>
<PARA>In this respect, I commend the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when, at the opening of the International Year for the Indigenous People on 10 December 1992, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Isn't it reasonable to say that if we can build a prosperous and remarkable harmonious multicultural society in Australia, surely we can find just solutions to the problems which beset the first Australians&mdash;the people to whom the most injustice has been done.</PARA>
<PARA>The indigenous community across this country is aware of the commitment of the Prime Minister to its cause. I believe it is not only reasonable but absolutely crucial to the future welfare of this country that the opportunity presently before us in the shape of the Mabo judgment is not squandered. We are truly presented with an historic opportunity. The question is whether we have the foresight, the courage and the maturity to respond to that challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have real concerns that the forces representing parochialism, vested interests and economic exploitation may overcome those in our community who are committed to social justice. If this happens, we will see a repeat of the last 200 years of suffering inflicted because of ignorance and lack of respect accorded to the indigenous people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the core of this problem is the dispossession of the original inhabitants of this country. It has been said that issues about land rights, native title, et cetera, blur our focus from the urgent social welfare and health issues facing our indigenous community. I contend that unless we squarely face up to the issues of dispossession we will never effectively deal with the plethora of problems that are its consequence. The document to which I earlier referred further states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now widely recognised that the dispossession of a people, the destruction of the culture, and their marginalisation in a larger society, produce problems that are extremely difficult to combat and can only be addressed in a long time frame. The wounds are such that they are not to be healed in a decade, or even in a single generation. Patience and persistence are required; and, of vital importance, restoration to the people themselves of control over their own lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is indeed what ATSIC is endeavouring to achieve. What are the results which continue to impact on the day-to-day experience of our indigenous brothers and sisters? Mortality rates three times higher than the national average; 15 to 20 years lower life expectancy than in the wider community; infant and peri-natal mortality rates three times the national average; unemployment rates three times the national average; mean individual income two-thirds of the national mean for the rest of us; serious and continuing problems with school retention rates, particularly at secondary and post-secondary levels; huge problems in the provision of adequate housing and essential community services in remote communities; and equitable access to accommodation in urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all too easy for us to receive such statistics in a way that keeps us protected emotionally from entering the lives and sharing the suffering that our arrogance and ignorance continue to inflict. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, it has been my privilege to meet with many indigenous people in recent weeks. These people are working under enormous pressure to provide services to their communities, with resources which do not go anywhere near meeting the need in spite of the federal government's $1.3 billion allocation in the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to offer to the House some vignettes from the real life experiences of people. We met with a health worker at Danila Dilba in Darwin last week to discuss the service. She was visibly shaken by the sudden, violent death two or three days before of one of her colleagues with whom she had been working to support her people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the quorum was called, I was endeavouring to inject into this sanctified, clean place where we feel quite protected, some of the real life experiences of indigenous people. I referred to the fact that, when we met at Danila Dilba in Darwin, we heard the shocking story of the sudden, violent death of one of the health workers. It was a loss to the health team of already underresourced and hard-pressed workers who raised the issue of the major health problem of sexually transmitted diseases and the potential disaster of the development of the HIV virus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) asked, `What is ATSIC doing about it?'. I ask, `What is the Northern Territory government doing about it?'. When we spoke to health representatives from that government they said, `What problem?'. The reality out in the community is that state governments, in spite of federal funding, are absolving themselves from their responsibility to provide effective resources. We talk about `culturally appropriate services'&mdash;but there are none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health worker from Danila Dilba said that she had taken her son to the Alice Springs Hospital where she observed absolutely blatant racism. An Aboriginal woman came into the hospital&mdash;she was intoxicated but she had a severely broken arm&mdash;in urgent need of medical attention and was absolutely ignored by the white health worker at casualty while she, a respectable black, was given the courtesy of service. When this matter was raised by the health worker she was told, `She will have to wait'. This is the kind of service that our indigenous people have meted out to them on a daily basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disastrous situation for young Aboriginal men and the lack of services available to support them was also pointed out to us. Real concerns were expressed about what is going to become a major problem in this community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This very articulate, warm, sensitive and caring woman told us that, every time she walks into a real estate agency, she suffers incredible stress from indirect and direct racism. We discovered right across the board that people of great intelligence and articulation, who would grace the floor of this chamber&mdash;every one of them&mdash;are being treated with abominable contempt in their daily lives while they are endeavouring to provide services to their communities. This is the kind of problem that has resulted from dispossession. These experiences are supported by the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Elliot Johnston stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had no conception of the degree of pin-pricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference with which so many Aboriginal people were visited on a day to day basis.</PARA>
<PARA>ATSIC is one response to the challenges we face as we deal with the consequences of colonisation. Its corporate plan states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The goal of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is to secure the empowerment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples so that, through self-determination they can make the decisions that affect their lives and share in Australia's land, wealth and resources, contributing equitably to the nation's economic, social and political life, with full recognition of their indigenous cultural heritage as the First Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>Undoubtedly there are criticisms of ATSIC's structure and operation from within indigenous communities and high expectations of what can be achieved. There is also great determination from the people we met to face these challenges and forward the needs and aspirations of their people for the benefit of our country. In this respect, I endorse the comments of the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With reference to the broader agenda, the consequence of occupation, dispossession and genocide, I think it is very important that we do not absolve ourselves from responsibility. I have heard members of this House suggest that we do not need to feel guilty. Is that what we say to the German people? Do we say, `We must forget all those terrible things that happened in the genocide of the Jewish people.'? No, we do not. We keep saying that we must learn from the mistakes of history, we must admit our responsibility, otherwise the issues that caused the Holocaust will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very same way, the imperative we in this parliament face at this moment in our history is whether we are up to the challenge posed by the High Court decision on native title. How will history judge us? Will history conclude that we were tried and found wanting? Will we be diminished in the eyes of our children and their children because we placed petty, immediate self-interest ahead of a higher moral imperative? Will our standing in the international world be irretrievably damaged? These are very important issues as we face up to the consequences of the wider agenda of our responsibility for our indigenous people. They are more than prepared to work with us in reconciliation. In fact, they have demonstrated an amazing amount of ability to withstand us. Perhaps it is because their occupation of this country is 40,000 years while ours is a miserable 200 years. Professor Stanner has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the history of the past cannot be changed, it is within our power to create the history of the future.</PARA>
<PARA>We should take full cognisance of this message from Professor Stanner and commit ourselves to our undeniable responsibilities. We have the opportunity to work with our indigenous people towards true reconciliation. I hope this parliament will not be found wanting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish by telling honourable members that the young people of this country will not be found wanting. I refer to the young in grades four and five at Taranganba primary school in my electorate who have been quite able to pick up on the crucial issues of the history of our country and are aware of our responsibilities on dispossession. Certainly, when I had the privilege to talk with them on the Mabo issue, they fully supported the Prime Minister and this government in our attempts to forward social justice to the indigenous people of this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar). I think it is fair enough and reasonable that after some three years of operation an organisation of such vital importance to indigenous Australians should be subject to an external review. I know there was an internal review in February this year, but I tend to have some doubts about internal reviews, whether they are conducted by ATSIC, police departments or anybody else. I think it is appropriate that there should be a thorough and searching review of the operation of ATSIC. It is too important to the indigenous people of Australia not to have that review take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had informal talks and public formal hearings in Brisbane, Rockhampton, Thursday Island, Cairns, Darwin, Alice Springs and in the Pitjantjatjara lands in northern South Australia. Those we have talked to, almost without exception, have come up with criticisms and complaints about ATSIC. That is not to say that it is wrong in principle, but I believe, as a result of the evidence that I have heard, there is a need for a review. That is why I do support very specifically the amendment moved this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about the apparent lack of consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities on the legislation we are considering today. As late as yesterday afternoon I had a meeting with the chairperson and two other members of the Sydney regional council of ATSIC. They had not even received a copy of the bill we are debating, until it was given to them by the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), yesterday morning. Quite frankly, this is absolutely outrageous. If we are to put legislation into this parliament concerning Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, there should at least be the courtesy of consultation beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is in the chamber. I have the greatest respect for him and the way that he conducts his portfolio. But I would like to suggest to him that somewhere down the track there has been a breakdown in communication. If those in his department who are preparing legislation are not undertaking the consultation with regional councils of ATSIC that I believe would be a basic first step in the preparation of legislation, something has to be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this bill we have a proposal to change the regional councils, to limit them in number and a number of other provisions. At the present time, regional councils are able to establish advisory committees, which may include members of the regional council. There can be remuneration and allowances for their services. We are now seeking with this bill to introduce some budget constraints on remuneration and allowances. I think that is fair enough. There should not be an open ticket with no limit. That is something that I do agree with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also agree with the introduction of a ward system. That will be a more democratic way of electing members of regional councils. I am certainly aware of situations where, if there is one family group that is larger than the others, we do get a degree of ascendancy and dominance and views of other groups are not necessarily fairly represented. I think it is fair to say that there is a great deal of concern about the rights and the roles of advisory committees. Regional councils in effect only make recommendations and do not make decisions, yet if we go and talk to communities they see their regional council as being at the coalface. They do not realise that the regional council does not have the absolute authority to make the decision on where programs are to be allocated and where funding will go. I think it is probably fair to say that most people in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities think that their regional council has far more power than it actually has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one area, the Islanders Coordinating Council of the Torres Strait&mdash;the ICC&mdash;that does have the same authority and power as local government. The first consideration of the way we are to operate regional councils of ATSIC is that, in communities where they are separate and identifiable, very strong consideration should be given to giving those communities local government powers as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week we were at Amata in the Pitjantjatjara lands. It was the first time I had been there and, quite frankly, I was quite dismayed at the level of infrastructure that was provided. We all know about the incidence of disease among Aboriginal people. I compliment my colleague the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), who has drawn the attention of many honourable members to ear problems that are endemic in western New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not one centimetre of bitumen in the Amata community&mdash;of course it is a very dry area; although, amazingly, there had been rain the night before we got there and we could not go on to visit the second community because the air strip was too wet&mdash;and the dust problem is quite incredible. There is also an urgent need in that community for additional housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To balance the books, I will refer to something the honourable member for Capricornia said when she opened her remarks. She spoke of the contribution of the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) and said that instead of complaining about the needs in the health area we should get stuck into the CLP government in the Northern Territory. That may well be true, but I suggest that the honourable member for Capricornia should cast her arms a little wider and take in Queensland. After all, we have been waiting for three years for something to happen with the Torres Strait health strategy. We should also talk about South Australia&mdash;where we visited. All I am really saying is that it is probably not appropriate, in what we hope will continue to be a bipartisan area, to single out different state governments because all of them could be speared&mdash;to use an appropriate word&mdash;pretty well on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken about the need for regional councils to be able to make decisions and I referred to Amata. I would like to make another point about Amata. In that community there is housing for the indigenous people and housing for the white people who work there as well. It was brought very forcefully to our attention that the houses of white Australians&mdash;teachers, health workers and others&mdash;have rainwater tanks, even though the bore water is apparently quite acceptable and potable. Black people living in that community do not have rainwater tanks. This is just one of those basic injustices that I think should appal every Australian. It is an indicator of the need for Australia as a community, as a nation, to take a greater interest in seeing that injustice and inequity are wiped out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take a view which would probably be different from that of many of my colleagues. As a basic principle, I subscribe to the proposition that Australia, as a caring, compassionate society, should do everything possible to help anybody in need. I think help should be given not on the basis of race, colour or creed but on the basis of need. Having said that, I do not quibble with the funding that has been provided specifically for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities because it is impossible to debate that the need there is great and absolutely real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to another point made by the honourable member for Capricornia about Aboriginal health. As an Australian male, it is absolutely horrifying that one of my male constituents who happens to be Aboriginal has, on average, a life expectancy&mdash;I do not have the exact figure; I am sure it varies from place to place&mdash;of about 25 years less than mine. That should be a key indicator to every Australian; it is not acceptable. It is totally unacceptable that an Aboriginal woman who lives in Kempsey&mdash;a beautiful part of my electorate&mdash;will have an average life expectancy of 15 to 20 years less than my wife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are considering the plight of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, all sorts of issues intrude on us&mdash;quality of life and so on. But life expectancy is the basic human right&mdash;the right to live. Unless we can do something to address that, we will have failed not just Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, but we will have failed ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to get back to the regional councils. While we acknowledge that the first lot of amendments introduced in May tightened up the administration of ATSIC, I am still getting the message from regional councils that the level of consultation is inadequate. We did not see the first lot of amendments until one day before their presentation to the House. Again, in my opinion, this is totally unacceptable. If we are going to introduce legislation into this place about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people there has to be consultation in advance. A draft bill should be sent out for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to introduce legislation regarding pharmacists, consultation takes place; and if we are going to introduce legislation about road transport, consultation takes place. Yet it appears&mdash;I know the minister will take note of this, and I am sure that he will take action as well&mdash;that in this particular area, perhaps above all others in Australia, there should be consultation. But it has not happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regional councils are uncertain of their roles and their power. This is part of the need for a review, as expressed in the amendment. They receive differing advice from the Auditor-General and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch); they receive different advice from ATSIC; they receive different advice from all sorts of different bureaucracies. The issues tend to be clouded by conflicting advice and regional councils find this very frustrating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment has been made that, when the central office of ATSIC was set up, the original aim was to have 100 staff. Of course, there are now about 600 staff. They may be necessary, but the overcentralisation of the organisation will only make it more remote from the people, the communities and the islands that it is supposed to serve. People complain of non-advice, conflicting advice and the wrong advice, and they are right to complain about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have also made the point&mdash;it is something that I agree with&mdash;that they are told the minister has no power; that it has all gone to ATSIC. Quite frankly, one could perhaps be just a little suspicious about the way it has been set up, in that it enables the government minister to pass everything over to ATSIC. In fact, as one talks to Aboriginal and Islander communities right around Australia, one finds more and more often that people are describing instances where the ball is flicked away to ATSIC more often than a pass in a springbok test. That is probably wrong. I do not criticise the present minister for that, but I think it is inherent in the way ATSIC has been set up that it is now perceived by a great many as having been put there to take the pressure off the government; to take the heat off it. I do not think that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC has been described as an administrative nightmare. As one talks to Aboriginal and Islander people, one hears many anecdotes about matters that have had to go to the regional council, which could not do anything about them; they have then gone to the state office&mdash;what the state office is, nobody really knows&mdash;and then to Canberra, where the bureaucracy makes the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I come back to the amendment. There is a need for review. I support the body of ATSIC; I support the organisation. I concede that the job has to be done and that there are many people who are very active in ATSIC, both as commissioners and in the regional councils, who have a tremendous amount of ability. In the course of the last three weeks I have been incredibly impressed with the bearing and the conduct of most of the people who have come before us. They have been articulate, sensible and had commonsense as well. I do not pay tribute to them all&mdash;there were some instances where one could have been a little critical of the performances, particularly the stage-managing of media events rather than getting down to the business of giving evidence to the committee. But forget that. By and large, I am totally impressed with the people we are meeting&mdash;with their dignity and, as I said, with the way they are conducting the affairs of their organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we still have the comment that nobody is consulting with the regional councils as to what the communities want and how the programs are working. That is not coming from me as a member of this parliament; that is coming from Aboriginal people who are members of regional councils. I believe that endorses and reinforces the need to have some form of external review. Three years down the track it is time for another detailed look. After all, the regional councils meet only every four to six weeks and they do not have enough time, hence the need for advisory committees. When we are looking at regional councils, we need to go beyond the power to make recommendations; we need to give them some real power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I want to make concerns the composition of the ATSIC commissioners. At the present time two are appointed by the minister and, quite frankly, I believe that is wrong. The organisation should be fully elected by the people it represents. It is an outmoded instance of colonialism for the minister to have the power to appoint two commissioners to ATSIC. It would be just as bad for the New South Wales government to say to the people of Coffs Harbour, `You can elect seven of your councillors, but we are going to appoint two more'. Why should Aboriginal people be treated differently? I appeal to the minister: next time he is looking at amendments, he might take this on board and give to the Aboriginal and Islander people of Australia the right to elect the people that they want to run their particular affairs. Let us give some more teeth and some more real power to regional councils. </PARA>

The buck stops here. I do not doubt the intentions of my colleague the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and speakers on the other side of the House when they say that we can go to Aboriginal communities and get different views. We hear some who say that they are dissatisfied with ATSIC; some will say that they have not been fully informed about these amendments. That is true. One cannot go to Aboriginal communities, many of which are in the most remote parts of Australia, without getting that sort of advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing for this parliament is this: do we accept the views and the attempts that have been made by ATSIC to recommend these changes to the parliament and to their Aboriginal constituency? Can anybody say that there have not been attempts by ATSIC to do that? Does anybody suggest that ATSIC has not had workshops; that it has not corresponded with Aboriginal communities? Unfortunately, yet again we hear from the opposition that there has not been enough consultation and it now wants to have a review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without meaning to give offence, let me say this: one of the things I have found worrying in the general position of the coalition&mdash;and I speak of its overall political conclusions rather than what I regard as the very legitimate concerns that exist in many members of the opposition&mdash;is that, ever since the election of the Hawke government, I do not remember a single proposition coming before this parliament in respect of Aboriginal people that has not been opposed or subject to attempted amendment by the coalition. It might well be that, as with any government, mistakes have been made, but I do not remember a single occasion where there has been a warm and positive response. There has always been a negative response. Of course, not all Aboriginal people are happy with these amendments. Not all Australian people are happy with this parliament. </PARA>

The opposition is always concerned about health&mdash;if only we would fix up their health and their housing, it would be all right. The deep cry from the heart of Aboriginal Australians, the deep cry from the soul of the Aboriginal people, is for recognition of them as Aboriginal Australians&mdash;recognition of their culture and their relationship to the land and to have that land, in many areas, restored to them. </PARA>

Take the two principal exponents; the two people who have attacked the Mabo decision, without any semblance of conscience, without any real regard for the truth and without any regard for its legal nature. I am talking about the Premier of Victoria and the Premier of Western Australia. Both men are on the permanent record as being opposed to any form of land rights under any circumstances. That is their political record. As far as they are concerned, there is no part of their states that can be handed back to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, a Labor government tried to give back the last piece of reserve land following a precedent set by the Bolte government. We are talking about an area of land that would not be a decent sized farm. But that was knocked over in the Legislative Council. We had to put that legislation through this parliament in its original form, and of course it was opposed by the coalition. When it was passed by this parliament, the now Premier of Victoria, who was then state Leader of the Opposition, set off on a holy crusade through the western districts of Victoria talking about the enormity of this act. The grazing community, which is fairly conservative in that part of Victoria, told him to go away and not talk nonsense because it knew about the relationship Aboriginal people had with their land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, this coalition has to make up its mind as to how it will address the very important and fundamental cultural and physical needs of Aboriginal people. There is no argument about the inadequacy of health care. In many areas, the breakdown in health is often related to the fact that we are dealing with a dispossessed people whose culture has been broken. We are looking at people who, in many instances, in inner urban areas have been living as third and fourth generation slum families. In the regional centres of Australia, they have been regarded as second-class citizens for much of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must never forget that there are Aboriginal people who are walking around this institution who were taken from their mothers, without any rights, in the 1960s.

That is a matter of conscience, and not merely for this side of the House; it is a matter of conscience for all members of this parliament. We must face the fact that, at the heart of the dominant white attitude that has been adopted towards Aboriginal people since this country was developed by white settlers, there is a view which is founded in racism that they are not real people; that they have no rights. </PARA>

Obviously I am more comfortable with the contributions of those on this side than I am with all of the contributions from the coalition. However, there are some exceptions to that that I will refer to in the remarks that I would like to briefly make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I should put on the record is that the coalition has come an extraordinary distance in its understanding of Aboriginal aspirations and particularly Aboriginal aspirations for self-determination. Those of us who have been in the parliament for a while will remember that, when the government moved to establish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the government and indeed the then minister, Gerry Hand, were subjected to the most extraordinary vilification. There was a most extraordinary campaign against the then minister and the ideas that he was trying to advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it is to the credit of the opposition and to the shift in Australian public opinion that ATSIC now enjoys a very large degree of cross-party support in the parliament. In fact, the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), said in this chamber on 13 May that he agreed with me&mdash;that is, the minister&mdash;that `support for ATSIC by both sides of the House is largely attributable to the quality, commitment, expertise and performance of ATSIC commissioners and their staff'. He went on to say that the opposition was particularly keen to see the continuation of the present high commitment to accountability by ATSIC. He is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC is one of if not the most accountable public sector organisations at Commonwealth, state, territory or, for that matter, local level of government in Australia. It is not only subject to the normal constraints and constrictions relating to accountability involving the Auditor-General, the parliament and the attendant committees of the parliament but also subject to a great deal of scrutiny by the Office of Evaluation and Audit, whose powers are to be further enhanced in the legislation that is coming before the parliament later this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also the case that because of the particular nature of Aboriginal affairs, because there are sections, regrettably, of the Australian community that are hostile to Aboriginal aspirations, there is no doubt that the media scrutiny of Aboriginal performance and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander accountability issues is dramatically higher than that given to non-indigenous organisations. Additionally, initiatives have been taken by government to subject ATSIC to further levels of public scrutiny and to further levels of accountability. They include the state of the nation report of the social justice commissioner, which I will refer to later in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are some very important things that should be put on the record about the achievements of ATSIC. First I emphasise the tremendous pride that we in the government have about the establishment of ATSIC and its performance because ATSIC is unique in the world. There is no other body in comparable countries or anywhere else that has been established and is responsible for a radical shift towards indigenous self-determination in the management, expenditure and control of government programs that impact on indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is true that countries such as New Zealand, Canada and, to an extent, the United States of America have shown the way to recognise indigenous rights by treaty making arrangements, there is no organisation like ATSIC anywhere else in the world. It is a great credit to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and all those who participated in its establishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of ATSIC has resulted in the shift of power from well intentioned ministers in Canberra, whether they be Fred Chaney, Peter Baume or people on the Labor side of politics&mdash;a radical shift in decision making&mdash;to the elected representatives of indigenous people in regional councils and a national board of commissioners. That shift in decision making is absolute. It is a credit to the parliament that there is an emerging understanding of the extent to which that shift has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some comparison should be made between the role of the minister responsible to the parliament for the ABC and my role in ATSIC because a very healthy ethos is developing and, provided ATSIC maintains its commitment to public accountability to the parliament, the maximum degree of self-determination ought to be manifested in ATSIC's policies. There ought not to be ministerial directions, however well intentioned, issued on a regular basis to constrain and restrict how ATSIC conducts its affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the best kept secrets of ATSIC is that it is a very lean and mean public administration machine. Only 14 per cent of its expenditure of $867 million in the current year will go on administration. That includes the entire cost of the ATSIC democratic processes. That figure is a great testimony to the extent to which dollars in the ATSIC program expenditure are not wasted on administration but are targeted towards programs on the ground to address issues of disadvantage in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the opposition will not be calling for a division on its amendment. I am pleased about that because, although the amendment is in a number of ways well intentioned, it fails to understand the nature of the problem. The bill does not seek to challenge the administration of ATSIC but rather to focus on the continuing disadvantages in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and to pose the question why change has not happened at the rate and to the extent that all of us in this parliament would want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) was right in saying that the last thing we need in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs at the moment is another inquiry. This country has had a landmark inquiry&mdash;namely, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody&mdash;which has charted the course for action by governments in indigenous affairs to address those very issues of disadvantage alluded to in the coalition amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The royal commission found that the disproportionate rate of Aboriginal imprisonment&mdash;resulting in the disproportionate rate of Aboriginal deaths in custody when compared with the wider community&mdash;was due to the underlying issues of health, housing, employment, education, lingering prejudice in the non-indigenous community and the lack of commitment by governments to principles of self-determination. We should be self-critical as a parliament&mdash;especially those of us on the government side&mdash;and leave ourselves open to public scrutiny to the maximum possible extent in determining whether or not we have given effect to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the next month, an interim report on the Commonwealth government's action in giving effect to the royal commission's recommendations will be made public. Without pre-empting what will be in that document, I can say that it is a document of which the government can be very proud, because not only will it minutely detail each and every program that is funded as a result of the royal commission and talk about the impact of those programs but also it will record the names of the public servants who are responsible for the programs, together with their phone numbers. Not only Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but also others in the community will have immediate access to further information about the progress of those programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the major accountability mechanism is not the interim report but an annual report that is to be produced by every state and territory government. We have agreement from officials of all those governments that the report should be in the form of a detailed response to each and every one of the royal commission's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have repeatedly said that the report of the royal commission must not be allowed to gather dust on the shelf. Governments must be held accountable for the implementation of its recommendations. An annual report will be the principal public accountability mechanism. It will be further reinforced by an annual state of the nation report produced by Commissioner Dodson of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental point that I want to make to the opposition is that it misunderstands the nature of the problem when it singles out ATSIC for scrutiny in respect of performance in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs programs. It is not just ATSIC that is responsible for addressing issues of disadvantage in Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons we have produced a whole of government report to the royal commission is that ATSIC expenditure is really totally inadequate to meet the tremendous needs of indigenous communities and the disadvantage of which the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) spoke. It is the role of other government departments and those state and territory governments to which the honourable member referred who have the pivotal role in addressing issues of Aboriginal disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give a couple of examples. Education would be seen by everyone in the chamber to be the linchpin of social change in Aboriginal communities, but that is simply not an ATSIC function. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has programs that boost efforts by state and territory governments, but it is government that has the clear responsibility for delivering educational services to Aboriginal people. The pressure, the spotlight and the scrutiny cannot be on ATSIC alone; it must be on the whole Commonwealth government together with the state and territory governments whose combined resources are vast&mdash;significantly greater than ATSIC&mdash;and who have a crucial role to play in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the sentiment of the opposition that we cannot be satisfied with the delivery of programs to communities; that we must scrutinise the effectiveness of these programs. We have to measure their impact and the extent to which they are addressing the issues of disadvantage. To that extent, the government and the opposition are on common ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitment of ATSIC to public accountability is not just accountability to parliament. Accountability is a two-way street. Governments and ATSIC must be accountable to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for their programs. That aspect of accountability has not been sufficiently emphasised by all of us in relation to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particular matter raised by the honourable member for Cowper was one that this side of the House was very pleased to hear him highlight, and that was the need for ATSIC to become a totally elected body. The history of this matter is that that is exactly the proposition that the government advocated in the last amendments to come before the parliament concerning ATSIC. To the credit of the opposition, it did not divide on that matter in the House of Representatives, although opposition to it was expressed. Regrettably, however, when the matter went to the Senate not only was there a division but there was a division that saw a very disappointing alliance of the Australian Democrats and the coalition to defeat the government's proposals to make ATSIC a totally elected body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time I did not seek, and I do not seek now, to score political points. I do not seek to make some vitriolic or angry speech on the matter. However, I should say that the regional council of ATSIC to which the honourable member for Cowper referred&mdash;the Sydney regional council&mdash;came to this parliament yesterday and today to urge the opposition and the Democrats to think again on this question of ATSIC being a totally elected body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to appeal to the opposition to use the opportunity presented by the amendments going before the Senate on this piece of legislation to reconsider the issue of whether ATSIC should be a totally elected body. As I said before, the ATSIC genie is out of the bottle and it will not go back in. There is no prospect of the parliament supporting any constraints that would erode the dramatic advances in self-determination that have been achieved by the establishment of ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that the power of decision making is now vested in Aboriginal hands. It matters not one jot whether or not the minister appoints the chairperson of the commission or any of the other appointed positions on ATSIC. I urge members of the coalition to look at the ATSIC act and at the powers of the chairperson under the act because they are negligible to non-existent. Why not have the confidence in Aboriginal people that we profess to have as members of parliament? If self-determination is to mean more than rhetoric and a comfortable turn of phrase in a parliamentary debate, we should give effect to our convictions. I would be the first to praise the opposition and the Australian Democrats if they were to embrace the opportunity presented by the Senate amendments to include an additional amendment to make ATSIC a totally elected body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude with a reference to the place of the process of reconciliation in this debate, particularly in the context of the opposition amendment. There are some essential elements of the process of reconciliation which have enjoyed the unanimous support of this parliament. One of those elements is a commitment, I believe, by all political parties and independents represented in the Australian parliament, to put social justice issues and the reconciliation process on the national agenda as one of the central elements to be addressed by our nation as we head towards the centenary of the Australian Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That deliberate strategy of putting the reconciliation process in place was to give us, as a nation, time to work through these issues. We do have some time, but the need is critical. No-one should underestimate the extent of the suffering still occurring in Aboriginal communities, but if we are going to address that suffering and disadvantage, it can only happen by sufficiently resourcing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs, by supporting self-determination by Aboriginal people and their control of those programs as the key to addressing those social justice objectives of the reconciliation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I note that both coalition members present in the House, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and the honourable member for Cowper, are people with a very deep commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I urge them to play the greatest constructive role possible on their side of politics to make the coming time of public and parliamentary debate about the Mabo issue as constructive as possible. It is going to be extremely difficult in the coming debate to achieve continuing cross-party cooperation in other areas of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, but I hope there are enough of us in this place who realise the tremendous damage done to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people when Aboriginal affairs becomes an embittered party political football and who can at least strive for common ground, based on a firm foundation of commitment to the principles that I have spoken of in the course of my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Does the Treasury analysis of the budget that the Treasurer released yesterday allow for the fact that the pick-up in wage inflation generated by this budget will, through bracket creep, increase the tax burden on Australians by around $4 billion over the four-year budget period? If the Treasury analysis does not allow for that, is it not true that the Treasurer has tried to hide the fact that budget mark 2 makes most Australians worse off and hits the poor the hardest?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 August I received a letter from the honourable member for Mayo. He asked me to subject the changes to the Prismod analysis. In his totally dispassionate way he said,</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem appropriate, therefore, that this budget be subjected to the same examination to establish just how the extra, regressive taxes will affect disadvantaged Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>The disappointment for the opposition lies in the fact that the analysis which was done does not reveal what the opposition hoped it would reveal. I will not try to imbue the Prismod model with any spurious precision because anyone should know that all of these analyses have their flaws. Those flaws have been pointed out in the explanatory documentation which the Treasury has provided on every occasion that the Prismod analysis has been used, either for the earlier analysis of the opposition's plans or in relation to this particular set of proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a total furphy to introduce the idea of bracket creep into this particular analysis. This analysis has been conducted on the basis that the price, cost, and distributional estimates may be interpreted as the change from the status quo if all the scheduled tax changes, out to the last tobacco increase in August 1995 but deflated to present values, took place in July 1993 with all the long run price effects occurring immediately. In other words, the analysis has been done on the basis of what the situation was on the day before the budget and what the situation was just after the budget if all of the changes had taken their effect overnight, which of course they do not. They take their effect over the course of the next few years. Therefore, there are no assumptions about additional wages growth, because this is a point change&mdash;a point change from one day to another, effectively, on the basis of these changes. That is the only credible way in which to undertake these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also make the point, if the opposition wants to get into some of the particular details, that it should be pointed out that a number of the measures taken in this budget on the outlay side, particularly those which advantage lower income groups, have not been included in the model. For example, waiving the waiting period for jobsearch allowance, increasing the earned income allowance for JSA and NSA recipients, easing the assets test withdrawal for pensioners, introducing the seniors health card, introducing the initiatives to boost the provisions of affordable child care, and a number of other matters, have not been included. If they were, they would all be advantageous to lower income groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, there are a number of other measures on the revenue side which have also not been modelled; for instance, the changes to FBT and non-deductible expenditures, which overwhelmingly would not impact on lower income groups. In the event, what this analysis has done is underestimate the benefits going to lower income groups and exaggerate the benefits going to higher income groups. I leave it to those people who have a fascination with economic models to have out this debate. I do not intend to get involved in a dispute between economic models. We all know that the Leader of the Opposition has a fascination for these matters&mdash;a fascination I do not share.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a long time&mdash;indeed, until 1984&mdash;wine drinkers in Australia did enjoy a very privileged position. They drank wine which was not subject to excise and was not subject to sales tax, whereas other alcoholic drinks such as beer and spirits were subject to a taxation regime&mdash;primarily excise. This, the government concluded at the time, was clearly inequitable. Over the years we have moved to remove this inequity. In doing so, this is a demonstration of the kinds of decisions which we were prepared to take, and which the coalition squibbed for many years. If we are now to make a comparison on the basis of the changes which were announced in the budget to increase sales tax for wine, we find that somebody who is buying a four-litre cask of wine will be paying 17 1/2 per cent of the post-budget purchase price in the form of Commonwealth taxation. If we take another comparison of five 750-millilitre bottles of beer, we find that about 32 per cent of the purchase price would be taken in the form of Commonwealth taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This comparison is even more stark if we look at the dollars per litre of alcohol taken in Commonwealth taxation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member probably belongs to the chardonnay set and does not like beer much. But a lot of ordinary Australians have been taxed more heavily through drinking beer rather than wine. There is another point about consumption patterns of wine since the introduction of the 1986 increase in the sales tax on wine. People talking about reductions in wine sales forget to mention that the consumption of alcoholic drinks by the population as a whole has gone down since 1985-86 by 14 1/2 per cent in response to such things as random breath testing, more healthy lifestyles and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that period, consumption of wine per capita has decreased by 14 per cent&mdash;that is about average&mdash;whereas the reduction in beer has been much greater. For normal strength beer it has been 22.5 per cent. So it cannot be claimed, as some in the wine industry would have us believe, that these changes have resulted in a massive reduction in consumption. Reduced consumption has occurred across all alcoholic drinks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point is that some people are saying that increasing tax on wine will affect the export industry. Of course it will not. Since the last introduction of tax on wine, the export of wine has boomed; and I believe it will continue to do so.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, and by contrast, a family with two children and a single income earner on average weekly earnings received very little increase in real income at all over the period. So for the people on three-quarters of average weekly earnings there has been an increase of 18.7 per cent. For a sole parent with two children the increase has been 32 per cent. For a process worker, married with two children, the increase has been just on 15 per cent. But someone on average weekly earnings has received next to nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why this time the government wanted the tax cuts designed to help those people on incomes between $20,700 and $50,000 so that somebody on average weekly earnings would get an increase of about $8 a week.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has amply demonstrated the decline in real disposable income which occurred during the coalition's period of office. This government set about to remedy that when we came to office in 1983. We started with a program which gave affordable wage increases, which gave periodic large tax cuts and which introduced the family allowance supplement, which is now worth $43 a week per child. For a three-child family, it is about $130 a week. We also offered $42 a week rent assistance. That was $172 a week to somebody on $20,000 or $22,000. There was an enormous change to income support for low income families. There were supplementary payments for lower paid workers, mainly women, and there was occupational award superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every wage increase worked out under the accord was opposed by the coalition. The tax cuts were written off by the Leader of the Opposition as deals. Every second sentence he uttered last year was about deals between the government and the ACTU. That was a code for the tax cuts we gave to lower income earners. He is now crying about them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition opposed the changes to the supplementary payments to the lower paid. It opposed award superannuation. These are the same people, the hypocrites, who are up here talking about lower paid people. The hypocrisy is just shocking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why a process worker, who is at about the bottom of the income scale for a full-time employee, with two children, experienced an increase in real disposable income of 15 per cent over that period.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why a single income family with two children on three-quarters of AWE experienced a real increase of 18.7 per cent. It is because of these policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition opposes the great bulk of them; it opposes most of them. It is why the government now believes that middle Australia deserves a turn in terms of the focus of the tax cuts and why they are being opposed now by the coalition, as they were being opposed right the way through the 1980s in terms of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last question the Leader of the Opposition was saying to me, `The gap between us is widening, the gap between us is widening'. Mr Speaker, let me tell you this: it is going to widen to infinity as he peels off like the Mars probe, looking for a place in life&mdash;which will not be far away. It will be a big gap then, a very unbridgeable gap. We will need everything out at Pine Gap to get a signal from him. We will need the whole apparatus working to hear from him.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this budget, the government is continuing to focus on its task of dealing with the incomes of Australians at those low to medium levels, and then on median incomes, via the tax cuts. It ought to be made very clear that, in what is the most stark case of parliamentary vandalism of an opposition opposing the House of Representatives legislation for revenue in the Senate, the Leader of the Opposition is now seeking to deny those middle Australians the very benefits he sought to deny lower income Australians, whom he now claims to worry over and to represent, in the 1980s.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I was asked a question by the honourable member for Cowper&mdash;and I understand he wanted to ask a similar question today&mdash;regarding access by still photographers to question time. Towards the end of the last parliament photographers were allowed access to question time under strict conditions which were set down after consultation with party whips. One of the conditions is that the cameras focus on the member with the call. Those arrangements involved allowing up to four photographers who are members of the federal parliamentary press gallery or the government photographic service to have access to question time each day. Photographers who wish to have access on any particular day advise the Serjeant-at-Arms's office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access has been irregular in the current parliament but has continued so as to ensure that representative photographs are used. The question of long-term access will be considered as part of the present review of televising of proceedings of the House. As an interim measure, I have asked the Serjeant-at-Arms to advise the whips' offices when it is expected that there will be photographers in the galleries. This was the earlier practice.</PARA>

<PARA>The Qantas Sale Act 1992 received royal assent on 21 December 1992. At that time, it was expected that the sale of the Commonwealth's entire equity interest in Qantas would be completed in October-November 1993. In line with this expectation, and the requirement that all legislation should be proclaimed within a reasonable period after its passage by parliament, the Qantas Sale Act contained provision for any of its unproclaimed sections to be automatically repealed if they had not been enacted by 31 December 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's recent announcement that the proposed initial public offering of shares in Qantas would be deferred until 1994-95 means therefore that, in the absence of any legislation to remedy this situation, the provisions intended to commence on the dates on which 50 per cent and 100 per cent of the airline are sold will, in fact, lapse on 31 December 1993. Of most concern to the government in this regard, naturally, are the employee related provisions of the Qantas Sale Act&mdash;which are planned to come into effect on the day on which 50 per cent of the airline is sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions either `save', post-sale, certain existing employee entitlements and rights arising from presale service, or else they remove airline employees from the ambit of legislation applying only to employees of entities that are owned or controlled by the Commonwealth. The premature removal of airline employees from the ambit of such Commonwealth legislation while the Qantas group remains 75 per cent owned by the Commonwealth, and the failure to put amending legislation in place to retain those employees' already accrued benefits gained presale, would clearly be inequitable and could not be supported by the government. It is imperative that these provisions not be allowed to lapse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To prevent any such inadvertent removal of the rightful entitlements of the airline employees concerned, I propose that the date of automatic repeal in the Qantas Sale Act be altered to accord with the rescheduled timing for the sale of the remainder of the Commonwealth's shares in Qantas in 1994-95. Accordingly, the bill before the House amends the date of the automatic repeal of the unproclaimed sections of the Qantas Sale Act from 31 December 1993 to 30 June 1995.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The opportunity is also being taken in this bill to make a minor amendment to the Qantas Sale Act to remove any doubt about the intended operation of section 37 of that act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the states, Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory in 1993-94, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting on 5 July 1993. The bill will replace the State Grants (General Purposes) Act 1992 and its provisions closely follow those of that act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current estimate of general purpose funding for the states and the Northern Territory under the bill amounts to $14.7 billion, or about 13 per cent of estimated Commonwealth budget outlays in 1993-94. As such, these payments constitute a major element of the Commonwealth's budget. In combination with the Loan Council allocations agreed at the Loan Council meeting, they also have a major bearing on the spending and borrowing of the public sector and in particular state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the 1993 Premiers Conference, the Commonwealth, states and territories recognised that the economy is continuing to expand but the generally subdued growth of the international economy is hampering a more rapid domestic recovery. While recognising that 1993-94 is not the year to cut dramatically into budget deficits, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Fiscal Outlook</EMPHASIS> report identified that significant structural repair of both Commonwealth and state budgets is needed in order to lift national savings over the medium-term. Indeed, the government's medium-term budgetary objective is to reduce the Commonwealth's deficit to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, and the states will need to adopt a medium-term strategy of deficit restraint if the public sector is to make a significant contribution to savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the assistance to be provided under this bill is in the form of general revenue grants, which are currently estimated to be $14.4 billion in 1993-94. The level of financial assistance grants in 1993-94 has been set so as to fulfil the Commonwealth's three-year real terms guarantee that was agreed at the 1990 Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distribution of these grants is essentially determined by the Medicare adjusted relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its 1993 report, including a further adjustment for the alternative treatment of stamp duty revenues from corporate reconstructions. The Northern Territory and the ACT will receive special revenue assistance funded from the pool of financial assistance grants of $30 million and $20 million respectively in recognition of the adjustments they face in moving to state-like funding levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of the commission's Medicare adjusted relativities reflects understanding reached with the states as part of the new Medicare agreements. The health funding arrangements under the new Medicare agreement took account of a number of health factors which were also addressed by the commission's methodology. Therefore, to implement the new agreement without also amending the commission methodology to exclude these factors would have involved a significant element of double counting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of the new arrangements on the interstate distribution of Medicare funding was to increase significantly funding to the smaller states at the expense of New South Wales and Victoria. The adjustments to the commission's methodology were expected to have the opposite effect; that is, to redistribute financial assistance grants from the smaller states to New South Wales and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales and Victoria were given guarantees that this redistribution of financial assistance grants would benefit them by $131 million and $112 million respectively. In the event, New South Wales benefited from the new relativities, but by significantly less than expected, while Victoria actually lost. At the same time, the smaller states and Northern Territory lost significantly less from the Medicare adjustment to the financial assistance grants distribution than was expected. Against this background, it was decided at the Premiers Conference that the cost of the Medicare guarantee payments to New South Wales and Victoria would be shared between the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contribution from the smaller states is achieved by funding payments totalling $216.6 million&mdash;to New South Wales  $72.5 million and Victoria $144.1 million&mdash;out of the financial assistance grants and hospital funding grants pool. These payments are funded by each state according to its share of the financial assistance grants and hospital funding grants pool. Consequently, funding the payments out of the pool costs New South Wales $62.8 million, 29 per cent of $216.6 million, and Victoria $45.5 million, 21 per cent of $216.6 million. The Commonwealth will make payments of these amounts to New South Wales and Victoria totalling $108.3 million, thus ensuring that the net benefit to New South Wales and Victoria will be $72.5 million and $144.1 million respectively. The gross payments to New South Wales and Victoria are therefore $135 million and $190 million respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993-94 these arrangements ensure that the Commonwealth bears approximately half the cost of these guarantee payments and the smaller states the remainder. From 1994-95 until the end of the agreements, the Commonwealth share of the cost of these guarantees will be halved and the remainder borne by the smaller states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time, state-like funding for the ACT will be incorporated into this bill. In previous years the general revenue grants to the ACT have been funded directly by the Commonwealth rather than through the financial assistance grants pool. State-like funding for the ACT will be incorporated into the financial assistance grants pool for 1993-94 and the size of the pool has been increased to reflect that change in funding. Special revenue assistance to the ACT of $20 million in 1993-94 will also be funded from the financial assistance grants pool and is included in this bill. Other payments to the ACT, including transitional allowances and special fiscal needs totalling $64 million as well as a further $20 million special revenue assistance, will be paid directly by the Commonwealth under the annual appropriation bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As noted earlier, the Northern Territory is to be provided with special revenue assistance in 1993-94 of $30 million. In general, the relativities recommended by the commission take account of the particular circumstances facing individual states and territories. The high per capita relativity recommended for the Northern Territory recognises the higher costs it faces in providing government services to its population. In the medium term this level of funding should be sufficient to enable the Northern Territory to provide the same level of services to its population as are enjoyed by people in other states. The purpose of the special revenue assistance is to allow the Northern Territory to adjust to this level of funding from the more generous levels provided in earlier years. It compares with special revenue assistance of around $40 million provided for this purpose in 1992-93 and similar assistance having been provided each year to the Northern Territory since its inclusion in the pool of general revenue assistance for the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with arrangements in previous years, financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance will all be adjusted for the difference between the actual increase in the consumer price index in the year to the March quarter 1994 and the forecast at the time of the Premiers Conference so that the real level of assistance agreed at the Premiers Conference is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In accordance with its priorities and policies in the health education area, the government decided that, from 1985, nurse education should be progressively transferred from hospitals to higher education institutions. This move has helped to provide a better educated and more flexible nursing work force and to increase the educational and employment opportunities in the nursing profession, particularly for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transfer will be completed this year and from 1 January 1994 the Commonwealth will take over full responsibility for funding of nurse education. This bill gives legislative effect to the reduction in general purpose payments to the states reflecting this transfer in funding responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, from 1 January 1994, the Commonwealth will untie annual funding of $350 million of Commonwealth road funding for arterial roads. In 1993-94, payment will be $175 million, distributed on the average of the arterial roads allocation for the three years to 1992 inclusive. In 1995-96 and 1996-97, the aggregate level of funds will be indexed to the movements in financial assistance grants. In 1997-98, the funds will be absorbed into financial assistance grants. The bill also provides for the payment of $330.3 million for capital grants to the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill includes one additional feature to the act it replaces.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill makes various amendments to a number of provisions: firstly, modify a provision which has been used to cover productivity superannuation determinations, to reflect the fact that they are no longer `interim'; secondly, modify the right of appeal from conscientious objection tribunals to reflect more accurately the role of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; thirdly, streamline procedures covering command and discipline where forces of Australia and other countries are serving together; fourthly, enable trustees of four welfare funds to be appointed by a minister rather than by the Governor-General; fifthly, remove an unintended double benefit for a small number of members of the Defence Force who have transferred to the new military superannuation and benefits scheme; and sixthly, provide a special home loans benefit for members of the Defence Force allotted to warlike service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before dealing in more detail with the last two matters, which are of greater significance, I would like to make a few observations on the other amendments. The superannuation determination amendments are simply to ensure that there is proper authority for determinations dealing with ongoing superannuation benefits for members of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conscientious objection amendments would modify a right of appeal. Where a conscientious objection tribunal has determined an application, there is a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, AAT, then to the Federal Court. At present, the Federal Court could hear a conscientious objection appeal from the AAT on a question of law and, with the leave of the court, on any other ground. The amendments would eliminate the right of appeal on grounds other than questions of law, to accord with current administrative law policy whereby the AAT provides final merits review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add that, although these amendments are necessary to reflect administrative law policy, they are not expected to have any practical effect. This is because questions of conscientious objection arise only in the context of conscription, and there could be no conscription unless Australia was under direct threat of attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to streamline command and discipline procedures where forces of Australia and other countries serve together will avoid the requirement for a series of formal declarations where ongoing cooperation could be anticipated. A standing declaration, to cover a particular country, would invoke mutual powers of command and discipline whenever the forces of that country were serving together with ours. Of course, this facility would be used only for close allies where we could anticipate ongoing international cooperation, for example, in peacekeeping activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to enable a minister instead of the Governor-General to appoint trustees of welfare trust funds are part of an ongoing process of relieving the Governor-General from involvement in the detail of Defence Force administration. The trusts in question administer welfare funds for each service of the Defence Force and retirement units for ex-air force personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the two more significant matters in the bill. The amendments to remove a double benefit for a small number of members of the Defence Force who have transferred to the new military superannuation and benefits scheme will correct a drafting omission. The error would allow some members who elected to transfer from the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme to the military superannuation and benefits scheme to receive a double benefit. The amendments have retrospective effect to the commencement of the new scheme on 1 October 1991 to remove the liability for the double benefit for members who have retired since then. Recent changes to the military superannuation and benefits rules have removed the problem for affected members who retire after 21 April 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two groups of members eligible to receive double benefits: Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme members who had retired with a pension; and members who had separated from the Defence Force and transferred their benefits to another superannuation scheme. Where a member of either group re-entered the Defence Force and then transferred to the military superannuation and benefits scheme, the drafting error would allow the member to retain the benefit derived from contributions paid in the first period of service and also to be paid those contributions again with interest. The amendments would remove the entitlement to the unintended double benefit. Forty-three former members are affected. They have been advised in writing that any payment of the double benefit would be recoverable but, as no additional monies have been paid to date, it is hoped to avoid the need for recovery action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a more positive note, I come to the amendments to provide a special home loans benefit for members of the Defence Force who have been allotted to warlike service. In May of this year the government agreed to a framework for conditions of service where members of the Defence Force are deployed overseas. The government's aim is to ensure that members who are deployed overseas will be assured of consistent and timely benefits. An important element of the agreed conditions is an enhanced home loans benefit for personnel allotted to service declared as `warlike'. This benefit will apply to members involved in the recent operational service in Cambodia, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia. The same benefit will be available for members allotted for service in any future overseas operation of a comparable nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional benefit comprises waiver of the requirement for a qualifying period of six years service together with an additional subsidy period ranging from two to five years, depending on the length of warlike service. For example, members who have completed operational service in Somalia will now qualify for waiver of the six-year qualifying period and an additional subsidy period of three years. The maximum subsidy period is also increased from 20 to 25 years. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, these benefits will be available also to all personnel allotted for future service declared as warlike and represent an ongoing commitment by the government to see overseas service by Defence Force personnel appropriately recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kinds of operation in question are an essential element of Australia's determination to play a fitting role as a good international citizen. As the burden of that role often falls on members of the Defence Force who are deployed in extremely difficult circumstances, I am sure the House will support the government's measures to establish a suitable framework for the associated conditions of service. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, which we are debating, deals with five separate matters: first, to take into account certain employer fringe benefits in the income test for family payment and the parental income test for jobsearch allowance and sickness allowance recipients of claimants under 18 years of age; second, to take foreign income into account in the income test for the family payment; third, to introduce the government's election promise in relation to establishing a seniors health card; fourth, to make the foreign currency provisions in the Social Security Act more responsive to market exchange rates; and, finally, to extend the period for payment of the advance pharmaceutical allowance. The seniors card was an election commitment. The matters relating to employer provided fringe benefits were the subject of comment in the 1992-93 budget. The other three items are new initiatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, let me make it clear that, while I will be moving a second reading amendment, these are measures that we do not intend at this stage&mdash;I underline at this stage&mdash;to oppose. I make that point because certain matters will be referred to a Senate committee for further examination and inquiry, and that may give rise to possible amendments at a later stage on the issue of the employer provided fringe benefits. I will come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it very clear in the first instance that this is important legislation. It obviously has certain financial implications for the government. As far as the opposition is concerned, the family allowance, as it is known, and the supplementary benefits are important programs. In fact, it was the Menzies government which in 1941 introduced the initiative known as child endowment. Members of parliament from this side of the chamber take a great deal of pride in the initiatives that enabled those who had families to be advanced in the costs that they have to meet and to assist in family formation through the assistance originally of the child endowment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Forty years. It is an outstanding initiative by our predecessor Liberal governments. It is not an important welfare initiative by Labor, but an initiative of non-Labor parties. I take great pride in that. In 1976 the Fraser government brought in the family allowance arrangements to replace the child endowment and ensured that that payment could be made to all families. It was not subject to any income or assets test and it was to assist with family formation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Labor Party may say with great pride, `We were the people who then started to limit it so that some families would not be able to be eligible for that support for family formation'. If they want to remind us that they were the first people to introduce assets tests in relation to the benefits that limit family support, let them do it. But I was not proposing to remind people that they were the niggardly folk who introduced those sorts of limitations on the access to those important benefits. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do not let me bait you? I can never be baited in relation to these matters. It is important to look at the steps that the government took to introduce a form of income and assets testing of eligibility for family assistance. If we are to have a schema which is designed to limit payments in that way&mdash;it has been part of the government's philosophy to pursue that approach&mdash;then it needs to be effective. It is one of the matters that we noted in Fightback. This government had allowed a situation to arise where family payments could be limited to those who had a family income of up to about $65,000 and those beyond it would be excluded. But it allowed situations to persist where people might have had notional incomes of many hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some people were known to be taking their benefits in forms other than salary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made it very clear in Fightback that, if one was pledged to this sort of targeted approach, it needed to be effective. We believe the system in that sense&mdash;as the government allowed it to develop&mdash;had become inequitable and badly targeted. People with very substantial additional fringe benefits were obtaining access to family allowance. When others with smaller incomes&mdash;and only one source of income&mdash;were excluded it created serious problems of inequity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We highlighted that and the government, very properly, after giving it a good deal of thought, has come forward with a package that, in the end result, seems to us to be severely flawed. That is the result of the government's period of deliberation. I draw to the attention of the House the manner in which these provisions are flawed. The package was designed to take into account a family's total income rather than just its taxable income. It was designed to include very specific benefits for health insurance payments by an employer; the provision of a car by an employer; school fees, if they might have been paid by an employer; certain subsidised loans; and housing fringe benefits. Housing fringe benefits were intended to garner up those situations in which people might be established in a fairly substantial residence, where they either paid nothing for it or paid a rental that was considerably below market value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In endeavouring to put provisions of that sort in place, the government's proposals run very much further than one might have thought. The government tries to exclude relatively minor additional and supplementary payments. It excludes union fees where they might be paid by an employer. They might run to cover a whole lot of other things. It has been suggested to me that some unions even include payments of health benefits as part of their fee to enable people to escape the provisions of the fringe benefits tax. They are able to run it through union fees. If there are such rorts in place, it is obviously of concern to me that this legislation is deficient in not running to cover those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government drew the rental subsidy in such a way as to cover its own employees and also the defence forces. It drew it in such a way as to cover those people who may be living in rental accommodation in more remote parts of Australia, sometimes in situations where the provision of housing might be a very important condition of the very service that people have to give. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which the provisions are to operate provides some flexibility in terms of what will actually be deemed to be a market rent, so the subsidies may not necessarily be a real test in that sense. Nevertheless, it is clear that people who have very small incomes&mdash;and where there are fairly marginal benefits in the form of rental subsidies&mdash;could be affected by these proposals in relation to their supplementary benefits. Or, in the case of the defence forces, those people at officer level might perhaps be excluded from eligibility for family allowances in circumstances where they suffer a very considerable disadvantage in other senses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are some of the matters that we believe ought to be looked at by a parliamentary committee. We think it is important to establish whether the concerns that have been raised with us&mdash;by the RSL, some defence families in particular, and also by other people who are required to serve in remote places, such as police, teachers, and fairly low-paid public servants&mdash;about these provisions to assess rental subsidies may in fact be so unconscionable as to warrant reconsideration of the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take up the issue of the rental subsidy. It was drawn to my attention in a letter from a member of the defence forces that there have been certain policy statements by the government which might have some implications in this area. This lady wrote in her letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the inclusion of ADF rental subsidy as income is wrong. It is not part of the ADF salary package. That is shown by the fact that the subsidy ceases when a member has his own home in the posting locality.</PARA>
<PARA>So it was not part of the salary package; it was not paid to everybody who was living in that particular situation. When people own their own homes in that locality the subsidy is not paid. That would suggest that it is not a fringe benefit in the sense that we normally regard these matters as fringe benefits. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rental subsidy is compensation for the housing disadvantages suffered by ADF members through being moved frequently. You may recall a Task Force looked at ADF housing in 1984-85 and out of its study some Government policy goals for employee housing were adopted.</PARA>
<PARA>She attached a copy of those goals. I had not seen them before, but I think it would be worth while for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) to look at them. It does suggest that other factors were taken into account in establishing this form of benefit. In other words, it was not seen as a salary substitute or as supplementing people's income; it was seen as a compensation for the particular service that they are rendering to the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote the basic goal of the government's policy in relation to housing for the Australian Public Service and the Defence Force because it said that it needed to be fair and cost effective. Within that basic goal, the specific goals were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) compensate personnel for housing-related disabilities consequent upon frequent re-location where this is required as a condition of service;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) provide adequate accommodation for personnel required in the course of duty to reside in locations where suitable alternative accommodation is not available, or required for essential operational reasons to reside at Defence Force or APS premises;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) minimise financial disabilities, of personnel required to re-locate frequently, which are due to inter-regional differences in housing costs;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) provide that an APS or Defence Force member not be out of pocket from reasonable expenses incurred in changing houses . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v)  facilitate term transfers, by APS officers for administrative or staff development purposes;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(vi) minimise housing-related detriment to morale of personnel and families when personnel are required to re-locate frequently . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These were not seen as fringe benefits; they were seen as quite separate matters. We think it appropriate that these matters be the subject of further inquiry and report. It is for that reason that I move this amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)condemns the Government for not protecting the interests of low income families, the elderly and the disadvantaged; and</PARA>

<PARA>I am sure that amendment will be willingly seconded by my colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who will speak later on this matter. When the matter goes to the Senate, we will be seeking to have it referred to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs for report on whether this bill was intended to include defence benefits and allowances, whether conditions of service are intended to make up for disadvantages and difficulties inherent in service life, and the wider implications of employers providing fringe benefits as part of conditions of service to compensate for remoteness and other employment related difficulties. This is a major question that needs to be looked at in this context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the fact that in relation to the testing for family payments the government now intends to take into account foreign income. My colleague Senator Calvert was one of the first to draw attention to the fact that people who had been resident in Australia were able to move overseas and draw very considerable incomes overseas, leaving their wives and children at home and continuing to receive benefits. These people were in a position to remit to their families very substantial income that was not taken into account for assessment under the income test. Having drawn attention to that, we believe that this is an appropriate response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise also the issue of making foreign currency provisions more responsive to market exchange fluctuations. I recently had the opportunity to visit Western Australia. I know the Department of Social Security is familiar with the case. A lady there had had what is often referred to as a `complex assessment' of the pension benefits that she was eligible to receive. This lady was subjected to review because she had a small amount of overseas income, some shares and some annuities, but not so large as to exclude her from eligibility for a pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the department did in her circumstances was remarkable. The first advice date was 19 November 1991, effective from 29 August, and there was a change in the payment of pension. There was a further advice date effective at 5 December 1991, one at 9 December 1991, one at 22 January 1992, one at 7 February 1992, one at 27 February 1992, one at 12 March 1992, one at 26 March 1992, one at 7 May 1992, one at 18 June, one at 2 July, one at 13 August, one at 29 September one at 8 October, one at 19 November, one at 3 December, one at 28 January, one at 11 March, two at 25 March, two at 8 April, one at 6 May, one at 20 May and one at 3 June. What will the government do when it starts adjusting pension eligibility more frequently for currency fluctuations? And the government expects its departmental officials to be able to manage those sorts of cases!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, I read a report of the Auditor-General which commented on complex assessments and the difficulty officers were having in managing those matters. It also pointed out the large number of errors that were occurring. It did not quantify the extent of those errors&mdash;a matter that I would like to see clarified by the estimates committee&mdash;but it is obviously a matter of concern when there are such frequent variations that adjustments are required as often as I have indicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter to which I wish to draw attention, and the reason I have proposed this amendment, is the impact that the government's budget is having on the most vulnerable people in Australia, the people generally reliant upon welfare for their support. While there has been a lot of discussion to date about the government's budget and its regressive nature, yesterday the Treasury tabled a model which illustrated the number of people affected by the government's budget measures, particularly with relation to taxation changes. It is a very interesting table and it clearly establishes that pensioners are the most vulnerable of all those affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Neil Warren, an economist at the University of New South Wales, substantially criticised the model because of the extent to which the data was flawed and because matters affecting the most vulnerable were ignored. Even if one accepts those criticisms, as I do, the model discloses that the lowest income quintile&mdash;pensioners&mdash;are the third most disadvantaged group. The second quintile, married pensioners, are the second most disadvantaged group. The income effect upon them is negative, as it is for those in the fourth quintile, who, as the government's own analysis establishes, are the most disadvantaged of any group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Warren also criticises the Treasury analysis for not taking the following into account: the extent to which people might be using leaded fuel&mdash;the model assumes that all petrol used is unleaded fuel; the impact on the cost of cars&mdash;people in disadvantaged situations very often need to use motor vehicles; and the extent to which even pensioners can have supplementary income which might be taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know about taxation and pensioners receiving supplementary income. It had been government policy to exclude pensioners from the taxation system, but, as a result of the Treasurer's announcement, they still have to pay tax even though they are in receipt of pensions. They are also affected by bracket creep, which is another matter not taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget changes are regressive because those on higher incomes are the real net beneficiaries of the government's budget. In other words, the government gave tax cuts to those who are well off but not to those who are most in need. One of the points that need to be made is that the government has introduced very significant increases in indirect taxation which will impact very significantly on the most disadvantaged people in the community, particularly those with little or no supplementary income and who are reliant on welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the opposition proposed a broadly based consumption tax which would have provided an eight per cent increase in the pension level and a six per cent increase for all other beneficiaries against a gross impact on their cost of living of around two per cent. In the main, they would have been between four and six per cent better off. That was the compensation package that the opposition proposed. This government proposes no compensation package at all to those people reliant on welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some very simple points particularly in relation to the sales tax issue. The way in which the government's sales tax changes have been structured affect the most vulnerable. How does that occur? It occurs in this way: the government increases all rates of sales tax by one per cent. If a person is paying 10 per cent wholesales sales tax on products he might be consuming, then a 10 per cent tax increase has occurred. If it is a 20 per cent wholesale sales taxed item, a one per cent increase in fact is a five per cent increase in the tax payable on those products. If it is at the 30 per cent rate, the one per cent rise is only a 3.3 per cent increase. It is very important that we understand those differences. If we then go and look at what items are taxed at 10 per cent, what do we find they are? They include biscuits, snack foods, ice-cream, iceblocks, confectionery, fruit juice, non-alcoholic wines and beverages, cordial, flavoured milk; a number of homeware items such as garbage cans and bags, compost bins, incinerators, brooms&mdash;very basic items&mdash;buckets, doormats&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) brings about one election promise of 1993&mdash;in particular, the seniors health card. I am interested to note that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) is not the slightest bit interested in health cards. The opposition is much more involved in the whole issue of private health care. What does the health care card mean? It means that 200,000 Australians will have a health care card which will enable them to have access to doctors, to pharmaceutical benefits, to hearing benefits, and later to the dentistry benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>What is important in this is the range of benefits. It is particularly important for us, as Australians, to look at that whole issue of hearing benefits. No other country has the kind of hearing testing facilities that we have in Australia at the National Acoustics Laboratory. Australians are very well served by that particular agency. It is important as people age that they have access to those services without having problems in relation to money. The extension of the seniors health card is a delivery of an election promise. It also means that people now have access to a whole range of services for which previously they had to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 200,000 people include a whole range of people who because of assets or their residency requirements have traditionally been precluded from receiving benefits. The government is delivering on this election promise for these people. When we hear honourable members opposite talking about the poor, talking about people on low incomes, we should remember that they somehow forget the range of services that are available and the kinds of factors which make up the social wage. They have very little understanding of what a social wage is. We understand that that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same can also be said about the family payments and the whole issue of wages verses income. As a government, we believe in prior right. It is a prior right of people who are most in need and who are most deserving. How do you say to someone who earns wages and who is on pay as you earn, `I am terribly sorry you can't have the family income supplement, but the person next door who is living in subsidised housing, who is driving a subsidised car, who is having subsidised holidays, and a whole range of other subsidised services is entitled because technically that is not wages'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member is suggesting that there should be no upper limit on family income payments. He has said that we were miserly and niggardly for suggesting that families with an income of $60,000 should not be entitled to family payments. That is in fact the case. Under this budget those families which have an income of $60,000 will not be eligible for family allowance payments. More importantly, families which have a whole range of fringe benefits which are not classified as wages will now have to declare them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very interested to hear the concerns of the honourable members opposite on a range of factors when they look at the issue of wholesales sales tax. I remind honourable members opposite that Australians own more colour televisions per person and more video recorders than any other country yet they are most found in lower socioeconomic groupings within Australia. One may ask: why is this so? Why? Because the area where they live, as the honourable member for Berowra has so clearly designated, has very few services. The whole issue and question of access to those services are at the very heart of disadvantage&mdash;disadvantages certainly on a level of income but also on a level of accessibility. When we look at a whole range of products which are available, the people in our community who find those things very useful and, in particular, a very important part of their life, think that those products are much more important than, perhaps, biscuits or ice-cream, which the honourable member for Berowra seems to find necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the whole issue of unleaded and leaded petrol, it is certainly true that many of our people do have cars that use leaded petrol. But why? I can cite an example from my very own electorate of Forde&mdash;a city of 160,000 people with the worst public transport in Australia which is recognised and acknowledged in a national report. That is why people have to have cars&mdash;cars that they find difficult to own. The local council there has failed to take up the challenge, and it has failed to address the needs of the people. I say to honourable members opposite that it is not a Labor council. Why should our children be subjected to a lead content in the air which is worse than parts of Sydney where we have heard that lead emissions are less? Why should children who come from poorer socioeconomic areas live in an environment where the lead content is heavier and, therefore, the damage to their health is stronger? We have to ask the honourable member for Berowra: is this what he wants? Does he want all those people who live in lower socioeconomic areas to have their children subjected to higher lead levels?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of when I was a very young child and a child down the road was dying from eating paint off the railings of a house because leaded paint was used. The same kinds of arguments were used then against a change from leaded to unleaded paint in that the poor were unable to afford to repaint their houses so their children could die because they had leaded paint. The same is true now. Are we saying now that the children of those people who are poor can continue to live in an atmosphere where lead content is unacceptably high and where their children are in danger? The target for this matter must be the delivery of public transport to those areas to ensure that people, who often do not want to own cars but who find through necessity that they own cars, are at a total disadvantage. That is one of the areas which we must address and look at. We must also look at ways in which people's lives can be made more meaningful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear from the honourable member for Berowra about the whole issue of families, family payments and women and children in relation to the budget. We did not hear one word of support or encouragement for this government which delivered to the women and children of Australia. I find it quite extraordinary. We acknowledge that families are entitled to expect high quality, affordable child care and to receive support for their decisions on balancing work and family responsibilities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite extraordinary that when we talk about child care and women's health issues the members of the opposition never want to hear. Why? Because this government has a record in child care that is unparalleled. We have delivered since 1983, when there were a mere 46,000 places in child care. Now there are 208,000 places, with an expected growth this year of 29,000 places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government acknowledges that it is the right of people to make choices and to take the opportunities that are available. We have a range of child care available: long day care, occasional child care, outside hours school care and family day care. This range of child care is offered to people in the work force, people in training, people who may have particular needs, children with disability and a whole range of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 230,000 families, with 358,000 children, currently not receiving rebates or money for child care. The honourable member for Berowra pretends that that situation does not exist. As part of a response to the demands and needs of the women of Australia, on consultation this government decided to provide a cash rebate of $28.20 per week. The honourable member for Berowra finds this a difficulty. We do not because we acknowledge that child care is an integral part of costs of education, training and work. It is important. We are also interested in an emergency care program for sick children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has discussed interminably the demands and the needs of the woman who chooses to remain at home and look after her family. This government has now done something about that. Yet the opposition is still carping. We will have a home child-care allowance of $60 per fortnight for those women who choose to stay at home. This is addressing the needs of women who have very particular needs and who want to be able to make a choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kind of hypocrisy demonstrated by honourable members opposite is extraordinary. We have heard them talk about the demands of the women who wish to make a choice about staying at home. This government has responded to those needs and demands by acting in a certain way and still the opposition is unhappy. The opposition talks about demands for an expansion of child care but still they are unhappy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also heard discussions recently on the whole question of women's health and health needs. Through this budget we intend to expand the national women's health program by $30 million. This very clearly is a commitment by this government to the needs of women in Australia. To ensure that those needs are better met, we are looking at a longitudinal study of women's health which will guide planning for future health services for women. I mentioned earlier the seniors card giving access to the emergency dental scheme and the general dental scheme which will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at a whole range of services in which health is the focus and in which people's opportunity to make choices is important. It is also important that we provide a way in which people can have access to those services through the health card, through a range of child-care programs, through women's health centres or through the dental program. In the same way we concern ourselves with the needs and demands of those families who are looking at wages versus incomes, which we have already discussed here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find the whole concern for low income families somewhat paradoxical coming from a group who were prepared to tax these people at a rate of 15 per cent on everything they bought and wore and owned, who would deny them access to a whole range of Medicare services and who would expect child-care arrangements to be taxed at 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, listening to the people in the community, has remained committed to a range of targeted programs. I suppose that is what particularly galls the honourable member for Berowra. The budget highlights the fact that we are listening to the women and children in our community and responding to their needs. There can be no question of that. This government asked the women of Australia what they wanted. They told us their main concerns were child care, women's health and violence against women. This budget delivers on all of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the very important issue of violence against women, this government has contributed $56 million towards women's refuges and shelters, to counselling services and to services for young women. We will continue to proceed along that path. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stood up and said that violence against women in our society was not acceptable. We must all stand up and say the same thing. More importantly, as a government, we have to emphasise that women's equality and participation in Australian society must not have the obstacles of violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not acceptable for one in three or one in four of our families to suffer from domestic violence. We must provide structures through counselling, other services and different sorts of programs to ensure that women are able to participate equally in Australian society. At the very heart of this requirement are services which ensure that people have access to child care and health services. The family income supplement and family allowance ensure that they can make a choice about staying at home or going out to work. They can access education services which they may need for training or retraining to enter the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This society is very much about structural change and our differing roles in the community. As a government, it is imperative that we constantly ensure that the choices, opportunities and chances which we offer to everybody are enhanced. An article only yesterday in a local Brisbane newspaper welcomed a new principal to a girls school in Brisbane. The principal was shown in a photograph with some of the young women there who are very competent and clever in the computer area. The article made the comment that it was only 100 years ago that most women in our community were unable to read and write or access schooling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking back on this century, we can see the sorts of opportunities and choices women have been able to make about whether they will stay at home or remain in the workplace. We can see whether they have had access to child care, health and the other programs which are an integral part of this government's commitment to the creation of a fairer society.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is concerned that the use of taxable income alone might not be a reliable basis upon which to determine entitlement to certain social security payments.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to the parliamentary secretary and to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous), who is in the House at the moment, that this side of the House has no difficulty with that as a general objective and that under that social security umbrella there are irregularities and rorts&mdash;I am reluctant to use the word `rorts'&mdash;in some of the allowances that this legislation seeks to overcome and redress, particularly in the fringe benefits area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Berowra said in his speech, there are differences between fringe benefits and specific conditions of service. That is the area on which I want to concentrate in my contribution to this debate. Let us look at what has been said about fringe benefits. I refer the House to a comment made in this place in 1986 by the then Treasurer, now&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). On 2 May he said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has over the years been a very strong movement towards the remuneration of employees especially higher income earners&mdash;by fringe benefits packages which allowed income tax to be avoided on substantial parts of the overall remuneration. So-called tax-free perks came to dominate salary package negotiations and packages were openly advertised in the market place.</PARA>
<PARA>In his usual, even-handed and objective way he finished by saying that fringe benefits are `the most rutted-in tax shelter and the most untouchable income of all'. We have to look at this legislation in light of what the present Prime Minister had to say about seven years ago at one end of the spectrum and relate that to the impact of this legislation, if we accept it as it has been drafted, in certain areas&mdash;particularly the Australian Defence Force, the police forces and, in some circumstances, certain public servants and so on. I remind the House of subparagraph (2) of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra. In part it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . calls on the Government to review its proposal to include as employer provided fringe benefits in the enhanced income test for family payments, those benefits, which are provided as a condition of service . . . having particular regard to the circumstances faced by members of the defence forces and their families.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very important to draw the line between fringe benefits and conditions of service and to highlight that differential. I refer the House to a very well-received and respectable report into personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force, the 1989 Cross report, named after a previous honourable member for the seat of Brisbane. In part it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conditions of service&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is talking about the Defence Force&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are the elements of ADF remuneration that recognise in a tangible way, that the profession of arms is a unique profession. Specialist allowances recognise special skills, and other allowances make up for the disadvantages or difficulties inherent in service life, most of them clustered around the operational need for postings.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conditions of service thus should encompass not only pay and allowances but also a comprehensive range of compensations relating to family and social issues, superannuation, hours of work, housing and organisational privileges.</PARA>
<PARA>Many of those fundamental conditions of service are under threat if the legislation unamended is approved in this parliament. Conditions of service within the Defence Force are compensation for those unique demands. Whilst the sharpness of that sort of comment might lose some of its thrust in a time of peace, it is very important that we not lose sight of the fact that those conditions are there to attract and retain uniformed people in the Defence Force. That same report went on to talk about the unique nature of the military and, in part, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence Force members are required to serve, when, where and as required, often in the most hazardous circumstances. They must follow without question the directions of government, while at the same time demonstrating initiative and originality of thought in the execution of their duties. Hours can be long and irregular. There is no recourse to industrial action, and compensation for overtime is limited to a small, fixed-sum `disability' allowance. Family moves are regular, sometimes seemingly random and frequently stressful. Demands made on members of the ADF are not limited to the contribution the Force makes to regional stability, the law and order of the nation and the maintenance of national prosperity and trade.</PARA>
<PARA>It finished by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During emergencies such as bushfires, cyclones and similar national disasters, it is the ADF to whom the community turns for a vital proportion of the support effort. The ethos of service&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">remains paramount.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important that we highlight that in the context of this debate. I noticed a message that the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, now the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), put out at his personal direction in June last year which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsidised rent through DHA will therefore continue to be a very attractive condition of service to individual ADF members.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely that in itself is telling as to what we mean by conditions of service as distinct from the fringe benefit consideration which is implicit and explicit within this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn specifically to this legislation. As a result of that, on 27 August a general message went out within the military which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government announced in the context of the 1992 budget that, from 1 Jan 94, the income test for family payment, additional family payment, job search allowance for those under 18 years, childcare assistance and Austudy/Abstudy will include the value of some employer provided fringe benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implications of these decisions for ADF conditions of service were taken up at ministerial level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis of the approach was that ADF conditions of service are a recognition of the nature of employment and the requirement for personnel to move at the employer's initiative frequently, and often at short notice.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After giving the matter special consideration, cabinet decided that ADF members should not be exempt from arrangements affecting the wider Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision regarding additional family payment is anticipated to have a wide impact on ADF members. Until the various quanta for the benefits are determined, particularly that relating to housing subsidy, it is not possible to indicate salary levels that might still qualify for AFP. It would appear that all but trainees might be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The full implications of these new provisions are being examined. We will be seeking urgent talks with the Department of Social Security to clarify arrangements as there are many practical aspects . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Surely there are two things that stick out as a result of that message that went out to the Defence Force. The first is confusion. The second, which is of very deep concern, is what is actually happening to conditions of service which have been established over many years and, as I said before, are there not only to attract but to retain people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people do not seem to want to understand that the Defence Force environment is unique. People who receive those payments do not seek to have them paid. They receive them as recompense for their regular movements and the way they are moved around this country and overseas. They are a couple of points in the context of this legislation that I think need to be made very strongly to the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall), who is at the table, and I hope to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security and, indeed, to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner). I hope that they will be taking notice of what is said and of what the RSL and the Armed Forces Federation of Australia have said and are continuing to say on this very vexing question of what might be seen, and is being seen increasingly, as a very serious infringement of conditions of service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Garland, the National President of the RSL, has addressed these issues in some depth in comments to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), other ministers and, indeed, some senators.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The RSL is concerned for the welfare of the families of young Service personnel. We have been advised that a plan was launched to include some Service entitlements when calculating income for the purpose of Social Security benefits, particularly "Additional Family Payment".

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This scheme being considered also flies in the acknowledged Government position that the people of the Defence Force are unique.</PARA>
<PARA>He also talked about the area of rent subsidy and we have heard something of that from the honourable member for Berowra. He continued:</PARA>

<PARA>Having extracted some of those comments from a number of people and organisations, I make three points.

There is, however, another dimension to the problem that concerns me which I place on the public record. I was informed yesterday that certain directions within the defence hierarchy have told people to use the phrase `clam up on these issues within the Department of Defence'. In fact, I am also told that a particular article in a service newspaper was directed to be withdrawn. So, surely, those relatively small occurrences in themselves are an indictment of what this government is trying to do. </PARA>

That was in August. It took me until December to get the minister for the environment and the then minister for land transport to make a joint statement. Categorically, they said that this was a beat-up, that people need not worry and, specifically, that there would not be a differential in terms of petrol pricing. What do we find? Of course there is a differential. Why? Because this government is strapped for money. This is nothing but a crass revenue raising exercise without any regard for the social conscience and social awareness which those on the other side of the House think they have the reserve on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is a further step along this government's road to greater social justice in Australia. It is a concrete example of the care and commitment that the Keating government has for those Australians who are in need. This bill is the second part of a two-pronged policy of the government. Legislation has already been passed which will improve the position of low income retirees by easing the pensions asset test. This benefit takes effect from 20 September 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that we are considering today is the second prong in our policy of easing the lot of low income retirees. It is to introduce a seniors health card, effective from 1 April 1994. The principal help which this card will give is that it will provide for certain older, low income, non-pensioner retirees to have access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits and hearing aid concessions. Even if they are entitled to only $1 of pension, they will be able to get this seniors card. The department estimates that this initiative will help approximately 200,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure is part of a mosaic of assistance to Australian families that has been a central part of the Labor Party's philosophy for over 100 years. This pursuit of social justice has been a central theme for every Labor government&mdash;state and federal&mdash;since 1891. Indeed, at its most recent federal conference in 1991 the Australian Labor Party reaffirmed this commitment in its platform resolution and rules:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social justice is the ALP's reason for existence. It is a common goal that unites all Party members. Through its objectives, policies and programs, the ALP works to create a fairer society for all.</PARA>
<PARA>This view of people, and Australia as a community, is not shared by the coalition conservatives opposite. The coalition's concept of social justice places emphasis almost solely on the notion of opportunity. This ideal of individual opportunity appears attractive, but the hidden advantages of some amount to a complete negation of opportunity being free competition for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there anyone in this chamber who would attest that the freedom of individual opportunity applies equally to the son of a judge and an Aboriginal girl? Of course there is no equality of opportunity. This lack of equality, brought about by economic and social structures, is exactly what motivates the ALP in public life. The coalition conservatives opposite are not concerned at all with this lack of equality. That is exactly what motivates them in public life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Advocates of the coalition conservatives' position view wealth and power as ultimately individual in character. They advocate that society should be organised in such a way as to give individuals the maximum amount of choice and licence in attaining it. In their view, the best way to achieve social justice under such a model is to let an unrestrained market have its way with resources and with people's lives. The role of government in such a set-up is very small. That is the view of the coalition conservatives opposite, and especially that of their most effective campaigner, Senator Bronwyn Bishop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia this approach to life and society is given support by certain media and academic circles. Their insistence that Australia follow a path of ever decreasing concern for real people in pursuit of the mythical land of the world-beating economy was rejected by the people of Australia on 13 March. An economic system that actively promotes a widening gap between the rich and the poor is one that verges on barbarism. This government will not follow this course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that had the coalition conservatives won the last election we would not now be debating this measure. To its credit, the coalition never disguised its hostile intentions towards those in Australia less fortunate than itself. Had it won, the 200,000 Australians who benefit from this measure would not be getting this access to pharmaceutical benefits and hearing aid concessions. Soon we will be presented with a health bill which will also incorporate the dental changes for senior citizens, making this a very worthwhile card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's hostile framework is the very opposite to the social norm that prevails in Australia today. Legislation, such as this bill, is expected and appreciated by Australians. We want a cooperative Australia where the weak are not victimised by their circumstances and the strong. The coalition wants an Australia where the weak, the less well placed and the poor are all flesh for the Frankenstein monster of its ideology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in the community, outside of parliament, should be constantly aware of the serious differences that exist between this Labor government and the conservative coalition opposite. These differences are not the ordinary day-to-day political ups and downs. I mean the major differences that affect all Australians who see the need for a restraining hand to be used towards those who abuse their wealth or position and a helping hand to be used to help those who are in genuine need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that each and every one of the 200,000 Australians who will benefit from this seniors health card will be delighted to receive it. Yet I am also sure that many of those people are voters for the conservative coalition. These people will enjoy the use of this card, see it as a right and a proper measure of good government activity, and yet in 1996 perhaps go out and vote for a conservative coalition which will take this away from them at the first opportunity. This lack of clarity in seeing the true colours of the coalition conservatives is a very dangerous situation for these people to put themselves into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How much better for Australians to look carefully at the real differences between this government and the conservative coalition opposite and then decide whether they want an Australia which is divided in competition or an Australia which is united in cooperation. In making this decision, people should remember that the rich and powerful always win every competition. Those who are not rich and powerful always do well out of social cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Besides the seniors health card, this legislation seeks to remove an anomaly associated with a small number of families receiving income from overseas in foreign currency. The purpose of these particular amendments is to ensure that families with a foreign income are not unfairly advantaged compared with other families with a similar level of income. Social justice requires that the government be constantly looking to see that its resources, which help the needy, do reach the needy. This bill will not affect families receiving income support payments because such payments are not subject to the family payment income test. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important at this point to be clear about a very necessary distinction. There are two vital social security groupings: income assistance payment and income support payment. Assistance payments are given to help parents and others meet the cost of raising children. The family payment is the principal example of an assistance payment. Support payment, on the other hand, is generally a person's sole source of income. The pension is the principal example of a support payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to reasons of administrative practicality, taxable income has been the traditional method for determining family payment income testing. Thus, payment of this assistance money has been subject to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Due to anomalies, some foreign income is not assessable as `income' for the purposes of the 1936 act. Thus, this bill seeks to take into account this foreign money in assessing what assistance money can be paid to families in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one in this House would be keen to see the government misuse its resources to spend money where it is not needed. This bill empowers the department to target more accurately the real needs of the community. This targeting is entirely consistent with the Labor Party philosophy of social justice and equity. This bill seeks to extend to 31 December 1994 the advance payments of the pharmaceutical allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This payment was introduced in November 1990 to offset the introduction of a charge for pharmaceutical benefits for people who have previously received prescriptions free under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. At that time, as an interim measure, advance payments of the allowance were introduced to assist pensioners of limited means, with high pharmaceutical requirements, to adjust to the changes in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Those pensioners eligible were then able to receive lump sum advances of the pharmaceutical allowance, rather than receive it fortnightly with their pension. This compassionate arrangement will now continue until 31 December 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the outset that the Keating government was one of `care and commitment'. This truth was accepted during the last election, and is the guiding truth which leads this government. We are all aware of the many problems, social and economic, which affect our country, and the problems of other countries with which we can reasonably compare ourselves. In the face of these problems, the Australian people can be confident that we in the Labor Party will not panic and will not throw the nation onto a social scrap heap in pursuit of a phoney economic solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final analysis, we are a society of living and breathing human beings. We are not things; we are not mere resources. We have lives, and we have hopes for our future. The Australian people expect to be treated with care, commitment and respect by their government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) has some commendable features. As the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has said, the opposition is not opposed to the general thrust of the bill. However, we have moved an amendment which I will strongly support. I emphasise that the opposition is quite happy about the fact that the government is taking some fringe benefits into account in the income test for family payments, the parental income test for jobsearch allowance, and sickness allowance claimants under the age of 18. As our amendment indicates, there are some people who are particularly adversely affected by these changes, and we are asking the government to review those particular aspects. On a number of occasions I have encountered difficulties where taxable income has not been adequate in determining the eligibility for a number of benefits&mdash;Austudy is one that comes to mind&mdash;because of the various opportunities that particularly self-employed people have of circumventing that requirement by taking income in fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a positive step to take foreign income into account in the income tests for family payments.

I have had many pensioners who are getting benefits from overseas, and who have been adversely affected by the way those calculations are done.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family payment is now regarded as welfare. It was never intended to be welfare. When child endowment was introduced, which is what it was originally called, it was a recognition of the importance of children to our society. It was an encouragement for people to have children.

I did not want to think too much about it as I have three young children. That is a horrifying thought to anyone, especially to those with young children. The point is that it does cost a lot of money. As originally implemented, child endowment was a recognition of that fact. It seems that the government has totally lost sight of that fact. The family payment is now being regarded as welfare and, in that sense, targeted on the same criterion as welfare is, and ought to be, targeted. I believe that we are losing sight of what family assistance really ought to be about. </PARA>

That is not overlooking the fact that there are single parent families. Whether that has occurred inadvertently or unfortunately, they all need recognition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am homing in on the issue of child support. I believe that the tax system should be used to support families. We should recognise that children are worth while. They are not chattels, they are not things; they are intrinsically worth while and have benefits for our society. We ought to encourage people to have children in traditional relationships. In my view we ought to encourage people to get married in the first place. It has been recognised that the spate of violent child murders and the amount of violence that generally exists almost all occur in the context of de facto relationships or in the broader context of a dysfunctional family. The connection is so obvious that it probably does not need to be stated, but it is a fact, and we need to recognise it. This government should be recognising it. </PARA>

There could not be a more important question asked about any piece of legislation. </PARA>

But the electorate did not want that and will not want it in the future. The opposition needs to find itself some policies, otherwise its vandalism of the government's legislative program will become clear to the electorate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) mentioned the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson). The honourable member for Lowe came into this chamber and indicated that she had concerns about the changes to the social security legislation that would bring about the deeming of unrealised capital gain on shares owned by pensioners for the purposes of the income test. Yet, did she cross the floor? Did she follow her conscience? Of course she did not. In the end, she did not have the strength of purpose to cross the floor and support the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) which would have effectively withdrawn those provisions that are so badly affecting those people who find that, after making sacrifices during their working lives to save for retirement&mdash;being in the position of owning shares and also receiving a pension income&mdash;the unrealised capital gain on their shares is being assessed for the purposes of the income test for the age pension. My understanding is that that is one of the first times we have ever seen an unrealised capital gain being assessed as being of value for the purpose of reducing the age pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Capricornia, who has left the chamber, mentioned the polls. I was tempted by the provocative way in which she mentioned the polls to rush out and get a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. If one looks at the AGB McNair poll in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, one sees that the coalition has risen in the polls to 46 per cent as opposed to the Labor government's 39 per cent. In fact, the positions of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as preferred Prime Minister are more or less the same. To my way of thinking, if that is not an indication of the great change that has occurred as a result of this ad hoc budget making on the run, then I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Capricornia talked about the polls reflecting what has been occurring. If she were to look at her copy of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> which would have arrived in her office, she would know only too well that in fact these polls indicate very clearly the problems that have been associated with the Labor government's lack of policy direction. The increase in the standing of the coalition reflects the enormous concern in the community about the apparent lack of policy direction of the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She also talked about NEIS, the new enterprise incentive scheme. I campaigned very vigorously in Western Australia to have NEIS enlarged because of the enormous concern being felt by those participants in the new enterprise incentive scheme conducted in Western Australia. Many of those participants were proposing to take out quite substantial loans and make substantial commitments to those business ideas that they were using as part of the new enterprise incentive scheme. At that stage, all the indications were that the number of places available under NEIS was going to be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was thanks to the vigorous campaign that was undertaken by those people in the new enterprise scheme in Western Australia&mdash;and, I might add, the state Liberal government that supported them&mdash;that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) obviously managed to find those extra places and provide for an increase in places. But this was achieved with some changes to the assessment of the business programs that are to be submitted by those participating in the new enterprise scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the legislation and the amendment which we are debating this afternoon, and I would like to commend once again the honourable member for Berowra for taking a very vigorous opposition stand in relation to the bill. His amendment is quite clear. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the government for not protecting the interests of low income families, the elderly and the disadvantaged; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) calls on the government to review its proposal to include as employer provided fringe benefits in the enhanced income test for family payments, those benefits, which are provided as a condition of service or employment in non-metropolitan and special areas in particular, having particular regard to the circumstances faced by members of the defence forces and their families.</PARA>
<PARA>As a person who comes from the largest state in the Commonwealth, I have very serious concerns about those changes and the likely effects on the eligibility for the family additional payment. This concern relates to those people who are in remote areas and to those people who are employed as personnel in the Australian Defence Force whether they reside in my electorate, or throughout Western Australia and elsewhere in the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring to the attention of the House the changes that are likely to be brought about by this legislation. The opposition's concerns about this legislation relate to whether the bill was intended to include defence benefits and allowances; whether the conditions of service are intended to make up for the difficulties or disadvantages inherent in service life; and the wider implications of employers providing fringe benefits as part of conditions of service to compensate for remoteness and other employment related difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income is to include non-monetary income, such as employer-provided, low interest loans and subsidised health insurance. If rental subsidy is included in the test, it will effectively push most lower income Defence Force families over the income tax threshold. It is my sincere belief that rental subsidies should not be seen as part of the Defence Force salary package. This subsidy of course ceases when members obtain their own house in the posting locality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has long been realised that Defence Force families suffer disabilities because of their residential mobility. Rental subsidies should not be seen as hidden income but as compensation where frequent relocation is a required condition of service. As somebody who grew up in a service family, I know only too well of the problems of this constant relocation and the mobility required of those members and their families of the Australian Defence Force. Of course, whether or not it was intended, the threat to the family additional payment to those members of the ADF who may be affected is a matter of serious concern, because the geographic mobility required in Defence Force employment can have significant effects on family life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most notable of those is that children may be forced to change schools regularly. Spouses who are also employed may have difficulty gaining transfers or finding alternative employment. I will give an example of a posting cycle that is mentioned in the case of a major in the ADF. At one stage, he had lived in 11 houses in 16 years. One of his children in seven years had attended five primary schools in five states as well as in PNG, and the second child had attended four schools in four states in five years. As I have mentioned, from my experience as a member of an ADF family, that is a serious concern for those members of the ADF. There are very substantial sacrifices required on the part of ADF members as part of their duties, which of course include being able to be deployed throughout the Commonwealth and throughout those areas where the ADF is in fact stationed. The Cross report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force</EMPHASIS>, found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ADF salaries must remain fiercely competitive if the all-volunteer force is to attract and retain suitable personnel.</PARA>
<PARA>But the measure being proposed by the government would substantially affect the remuneration which ADF members receive. What must be realised in this case is the specialisation of military employment. There is the need to be on call at all times and to work long and irregular hours; the need to live and work in uncomfortable conditions, short of those situations for which separate provision has been made; and the general turbulence in postings to the extent that such disruptions are not compensated in current allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a letter that was published by the National President of the Returned Services League of Australia. The RSL said that it was concerned for the welfare of the families of young service personnel. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have been advised that a plan was launched to include some Service entitlements when calculating income for the purpose of Social Security benefits, particularly "Additional Family Payment".</PARA>
<PARA>The letter went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government already recoups from the Department of Defence Fringe Benefits Tax on Rental and Home Purchase assistance allowances; the scheme would be unfair "double dipping". Any change to housing loans could be a reduction of entitlements from War Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allowances to assist in the education of children of Defence personnel are also apparently being considered. These allowances should not be considered as income in calculating "Additional family Payments" (AFP).</PARA>
<PARA>The president concluded in the penultimate paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scheme being considered also flies in the acknowledged Government position that the people of the Defence Force are unique.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say that, as a person who has a number of defence ADF personnel resident in my electorate, I take great exception to any provisions in the legislation that may reduce what are already acknowledged as being pretty paltry conditions of salary as a result of service in the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the opposition's approach to this particular legislation, it is going to move in the Senate that the matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs for inquiry and report. The terms of reference state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`All aspects of the Social Security Legislation Bill (No. 2) 1993 taking certain employer provided fringe benefits into account in the income test for family payment and the parental income test for job search allowance and sickness allowance recipients of claimants under 18, and in particular:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the wider implications of employers providing fringe benefits as part of conditions of service to compensate for remoteness and other employment related difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>I commend that particular action as being a quite sensible way of looking at the implications of this abhorrent legislation. As I have mentioned earlier, as someone who has a number of ADF personnel resident in my electorate, this would give the opportunity for those who are affected to have their say.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you refer to the first part of the amendment, it condemns the government for not protecting the interests of low income families, the elderly and the disadvantaged. To be honest with you, I cannot see that the comments I have made are irrelevant. The overall impact of the budget provisions clearly disadvantage low income earners, particularly families, the elderly and the disadvantaged. The budget changes are regressive because those on higher incomes are the net beneficiaries of the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a truth that since 1983 a single income family with children has effectively had its tax burden doubled. On the demographic information recently released from the Bureau of Statistics, my electorate would have to have the highest concentration of families with children. I find the budget provisions not only abhorrent but immoral. If it is not the role of this parliament to protect the interests of low income earners with families, those who are raising children at a substantial financial disadvantage in many cases, then I do not know what our role is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the second reading amendment argued so ably by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), and the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. Last week I visited two of the Army bases in my electorate of Indi&mdash;Bandiana and Bonegilla&mdash;and spoke with many serving army personnel. On any other visit, or in my association with the defence forces throughout Australia over many years, I have never seen or witnessed such concern, anguish and anger from the members of the Defence Force as a result of the budget and the way in which the economy has been adversely affecting them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They told me there was an incredible and increasing number of members of the defence forces who were relying more and more on social security support. That is a matter that has to be evaluated. I think it bears scrutiny. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, it is a matter that I intend to pursue in the interests of good government in Australia. It is remarkable that people who take up careers in the defence forces of this nation are becoming increasingly reliant on social security to make ends meet, to provide for their families and to try to make up to their families for the substantial disruption that occurs because of the nature of their careers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the members have to undertake shifts throughout Australia and other parts of the world. It is not uncommon to find an ordinary soldier who has already had 13 or 14 shifts with his family and may have another four or five before he leaves the army. The disruption to families is substantial and has a huge impact. There are many hidden factors that are not recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these enlightened days of people being treated equally and without discrimination in employment and other important elements of our society, if a spouse of a permanent member of the Defence Force applies for a job in Albury-Wodonga and she is as equally qualified as other applicants, when it is discovered that the spouse belongs to a member of the defence forces it is more likely than not that that person will not get the job. It is not that the person is not suitable or well qualified; it is simply that the employer knows that the nature of the job assumes that the family might be moving on in three or four years time, sometimes less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess it is human nature that an employer who is looking for someone to fit into the organisation, perhaps to undergo training and take part in the enterprise, will give an edge to someone who is more likely to remain in the community for a longer period. That is just one example of the sorts of problems Defence Force families have. This legislation is an attempt to impose fringe benefits tax on some of the small but very important incentive payments available to Defence Force personnel. So rent subsidies that help families cope with transfers from one part of Australia to another or to overseas postings will attract the vigour of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have grave concerns about the government's lack of recognition of the problems of Defence Force people and their families. I ask the government to embrace the principles of the amendment and review the proposal that the shadow minister for social security, the honourable member for Berowra, so ably put forward:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to include as employer provided fringe benefits in the enhanced income test for family payments, those benefits, which are provided as a condition of service . . . in non-metropolitan and special areas in particular . . .  regard to the circumstances faced by members of the defence forces and their families.</PARA>
<PARA>I am quite confident that if all those factors are properly evaluated and if Defence Force families are consulted, the government will have no difficulty in accepting the thrust and message of the shadow minister's amendment. When I visited the army bases and talked with Defence Force personnel, they were shocked and angered to think that their accrued long service leave and annual leave were going to be subject to retrospective taxation under the so-called great budget of the Keating government. Defence Force people are pretty disciplined, as they have to be, but that was an experience that I do not want to repeat; to witness the depth of anger, disappointment, hurt and revulsion towards this government&mdash;and towards the way the budget would retrospectively affect them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect, the amendment expresses concern at the effects on low income families. I think it is clear that the content of my contribution establishes that there are low income families in the Defence Force. The government is attacking low income families&mdash;not protecting them at all. I am illustrating the fact that the retrospective grab at accrued long service and annual leave of defence service personnel is immoral and not acceptable. The government has had to back off partially, as a result of doing a deal with the Australian Democrats. This has arisen only because the coalition has shown the courage to reject those sorts of taxes in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The battle is not yet over. Anyone who thinks it is over has another think coming. I understand that a couple of senators from the Democrats, and perhaps the Greens, are considering voting with the coalition's 36 senators to block the four taxes that are affecting low income families&mdash;the petrol tax, the retrospective tax that I just spoke about, the wine tax and the wholesale sales tax. Blocking those measures requires 38 senators; we have 36. Those senators who are not privileged at the moment to be members of the coalition team&mdash;but I am sure in their hearts they would wish to be&mdash;will have their phones ringing across Australia</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to point out that the legislation providing benefits to pensioners and other families is not opposed by the coalition. As the amendment has clearly stated, we wish to have these additional items considered in the context of the legislation. I remind the House that the government has still not resolved the question of attacking pensioners who happen to own a few shares. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has created more confusion than he has done with Mabo by allowing the Democrats to indicate that there will be a review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Prime Minister and his colleagues have failed to understand is that pensioners who have a few shares have been going through a lot of anguish for many months now. They have to make decisions that affect their security and savings before the trigger date for the legislation in September. This shows that the Prime Minister is totally out of touch when he says in a vague and uncertain way that he is reviewing the legislation in respect of pensioners' shares when he ought to know damned well that the pensioners have to make decisions well before the trigger date this month as to what they will do with their shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table, will be able to exert his influence on his colleagues in the cabinet. I am sure the caucus room would be available tonight for another emergency caucus meeting. The coalition would accommodate the parliamentary secretary if he wanted to defer discussion on this debate whilst we awaited the outcome of another caucus meeting. It is not a matter of the government being further humiliated; it is totally humiliated now. It is simply a matter of trying to get something out of the tatters of its fiscal mismanagement and the shocking budget that we are now trying to deal with. I hope honourable members will support the amendment. We can then get on with trying to rectify the havoc being caused to people due to this government's mismanagement. </PARA>

I also want to thank the other honourable members who have contributed to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened on many occasions to the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) put forward in many cases quite reasoned arguments in this place. He was a professional lawyer before he came into this House. Today's speech was probably one of his very ordinary ones because he did not have much zest. The reason is that he looked at the bill and found that everything we were doing involved very good measures, and in some cases measures those opposite would have included in their Fightback document. That document said that a lot of people were getting social security benefits who were not in need, and that the system was not properly targeted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member went back to 1941&mdash;over 50 years ago&mdash;to find something which the Liberal Party of Australia had done for social justice. He talked about Menzies introducing child endowment in 1941. If we look through the opposition's record over all the years it was in government then we would probably have to go back 50 years to find an instance of it doing something equitable and looking after people in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra did not tell this House that in Fightback those opposite talked about reducing outlays in social security by $1 billion. There is no question whatsoever that had those opposite achieved government at the March election, they would have taken this measure themselves&mdash;there is no doubt about that. It would have been the same with a number of other measures that we have taken. Naturally, those opposite have to find something wrong with the legislation, so they have brought out this position with respect to the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question whatsoever that there is concern amongst the Australian Defence Force with respect to this measure. But I do not know whether the members of the Defence Force have looked at it and seen just how few of them will be affected. If we look first at the income test for the basic family payment and then the additional family payment, we find that, as of now&mdash;1993&mdash;before one loses entitlement to some form of basic family payment, the cut-off point is $64,938 per year. That is quite a high salary. In 1994 it is proposed by another legislation, which I introduced yesterday, to reduce that cut-off point to $60,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, in order to get the basic family payment a one-child family needs to be earning $64,938 a year. On top of that, the family can have its own home plus $600,000 worth of assets&mdash;I think that is what it is at the moment&mdash;before it loses entitlement under the income test for the basic family payment. As of now&mdash;and on top of the $64,938&mdash;the family can earn $3,249 for each additional child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the opposition that a person in the Australian Defence Force would have to be of fairly high rank to be earning more than that. We must be talking here of somebody of the rank of general; possibly higher ranks than majors. Those opposite are crying crocodile tears. They are trying to find some excuse to criticise the bill because they know it is not that bad a measure and it is one which they would have taken had they been the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the 1993 income test, a family can get the maximum rate of additional family payment if its income is below $20,950. The cut-out rate is about $25,494.80. I have not checked the figures, but I wonder how many of our Defence Force personnel would be on that sort of salary or less. I do not think that many of our Defence Force personnel would be earning a sufficiently low salary for them to be eligible for the additional family payment now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I want to make a few other points. I certainly have a concern for the Australian Defence Force. The cabinet did give special consideration to this matter. I understand that it talked about it at length and looked at the concerns that were expressed. The rationale for the change is that taxable income does not indicate fully the need for government assistance&mdash;at the moment, it is based on taxable income. Employees who receive non-taxable benefits from an employer are better off than those on the same taxable income who receive no extra benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government did consider separately the situation of families of Defence Force personnel and the impact on them of the inclusion of fringe benefits in income testing for government assistance. On equity grounds, however, the government affirmed the decision to apply to these families the same provisions as are to apply to the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, this initiative may affect some families on relatively low taxable incomes who currently receive a housing allowance or subsidy from an employer. In this regard, Defence Force personnel are not placed differently from employees in local government, the mining industry, and education and railway authorities that also provide accommodation to staff in rural and remote areas or in recognition that mobility is a condition of employment. Similarly, employees of organisations other than the defence forces may be compensated for mobility through the provision of allowances to assist in meeting the cost of maintaining continuity of their children's schooling in a particular education system where the family so decides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra expressed an interest in those living in non-metropolitan and remote areas. The approach taken in this bill to the assessing of the value of housing in country and remote areas is designed to avoid disadvantaging families who live in these areas. The maximum value which will be assigned to a three-bedroom house in a non-metropolitan area is $100 a week. In remote areas the maximum value of such a house is $80 a week. In metropolitan areas it is $140 a week. Only the difference between these maximum values and any lesser amount of rent paid is considered as an assessable fringe benefit. Then the first $1,000 of the fringe benefit value is disregarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give honourable members an example. A corporal living at Albury-Wodonga, which is classified as a country area, and contributing $65 a week&mdash;which I understand is about the usual amount&mdash;toward the rental of his or her three-bedroom house, would have a fringe benefit value of $1,820. The first $1,000 would be disregarded, so only $820 would be included as income. The maximum reduction in family payment would be about $7.50 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying we understand that a number of people in the Australian Defence Force will be affected by the additional family payment that they might lose&mdash;and I question the number of people so affected. But it is no different from the position of other members of the community&mdash;railway workers, teachers and so on&mdash;who are living in remote areas. And the bill provides that the first $1,000 is disregarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand, again, why the opposition is bringing up this matter. It is obviously for political reasons: it is trying to create some concern in the community. But on this occasion, once the measures are properly explained and when people look at the generous income limits for the basic family payment, I do not think there will be too many in the Defence Force, apart from those who really do not need to come to the social security system&mdash;those earning more than $64,000-odd a year; I would say, the fairly high ranking officers&mdash;who will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the Australian taxpayers really expect the government to be paying family allowance, or the basic family payment as it is now called, to people on those sorts of salaries. I think that is a reasonable proposition. Do not forget that the test adds another $3,249 for each additional child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of fringe benefits, I conclude by saying that I do not really think the opposition has much of a leg to stand on. As much as I know that people in the Defence Force who will be affected by this measure will be disappointed, we are not singling them out. It is not an attack on the defence forces&mdash;quite the contrary. It would have been wrong for the government to have excluded the defence forces from this measure and at the same time include, as I said before, teachers, railway workers and others who have to go out into the country and get special benefits as a result of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not forget that we are not trying in any way to take those benefits away from people. We are talking about those fringe benefits which are given to people in the context of accessing the social security system. I think that is the main point we need to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go through a couple of other measures that we are introducing because I think they are very important&mdash;in fact, I am very pleased that I am a member of a government that is prepared to look at these things. During the last term I spent a fair bit of time with the Association of Independent Retirees and self-funded retiree organisations. I admit that they have got stuck into me on many occasions. The first thing I say to them is that I have a thick skin so they can go for their life. In some cases, they have put up fairly good arguments as to why some of them, who are asset rich but income poor, do not get any assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what have we done? First of all, we have brought in&mdash;not by way of this bill but by way of another bill which has already been passed by this House&mdash;the assets withdrawal rate. We have eased that. That was the first measure. That was as a result of many of my colleagues and me receiving representations from self-funded retiree organisations&mdash;many of them, Mr Deputy Speaker, live in your electorate&mdash;who have said to us, `Sure we have assets, but because of the way interest rates have gone down and so forth we are not getting as much income as we were getting'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now introducing a seniors health card. Those opposite know just how much value our senior citizen community places on these sorts of fringe benefits. They want security and they want to be able to know that if they get sick they can get reasonable, cheap medical assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By introducing the seniors health card, we pick up 200,000 senior citizens who at the moment, because of the assets test, cannot access it. That is, in my view, an enormous measure and I am glad members of the opposition are not voting against it. They are supporting it, and so they should. The honourable member for Berowra says in his amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . condemns the Government for not protecting the interests of low income families, the elderly and the disadvantaged . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Who brought in the family allowance supplement? Who brought in things such as the seniors health card? Who has been indexing social security payments? It certainly was not the opposition; it was us. So how the opposition condemns us I will never know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other measures is to ensure that the income test for family payments takes account of foreign income. At the moment there are people who earn income from overseas sources. For instance, an airline pilot could be a resident of Australia but could be working for, say, Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong and earning fairly good money, which would normally bring him or her over and above the income test. The point is that we have now included that foreign income in the income test for family payment. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">disallows the declaration by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA>As is evident from its terms, this motion relates to a declaration made by the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), under section 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act&mdash;the HREOC Act&mdash;with respect to the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. The effect of the ministerial declaration was, subject to it not being disallowed by the Senate or this House, to bring the rights and freedoms recognised in the UN declaration within the definition of human rights in the HREOC Act and the general functions of the commission with respect to human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me state at the outset that the general objectives of the UN declaration are laudable. They recognise that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and that no-one should be subject to discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief. However, the action of the former Attorney-General has given rise to grave concerns among a wide range of religious groups and members of the public. Those who have written to honourable members and senators include archbishops and bishops and representatives of a range of Christian and non-Christian groups. The main concern expressed is that the effect of incorporation of the UN declaration into the definition of human rights in the HREOC Act will be not to protect religious freedom in Australia but to limit it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition accepts that the ministerial declaration does not of itself make the UN declaration part of Australia's domestic law. The UN declaration does not impose obligations on citizens as a statute does. The opposition also recognises that the powers of the Human Rights Commissioner contained in the HREOC Act in relation to investigating conduct that constitutes a breach of human rights are, in practical terms, confined to the actions of the Commonwealth and its agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, it is accepted that some of the more extreme fears that have been voiced, and in particular those which suggest that the UN declaration operates to curtail the religious freedom of individuals, are difficult to sustain. Nonetheless, there are compelling reasons why the former Attorney-General's declaration should be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN declaration must be seen in context. On 7 December 1962 the General Assembly of the United Nations initiated the preparation of a draft declaration and a draft convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance. However, it was not until 1981, after 19 years of tortuous drafting and negotiation, that the declaration was finally adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In UN practice, a declaration by the General Assembly is usually a step in the process of settling a convention or treaty. The convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance has yet to be finalised, even though it is now almost 31 years since its drafting was initiated. The delay in finalising the declaration and the apparent inability of the United Nations to agree upon the terms of a convention reflect not only political struggles within the United Nations but also the controversy inherent in the subject matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the circumstances under which the former Attorney-General put his signature to his declaration under the HREOC Act. The UN declaration was adopted by a resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 25 November 1981. Although Australia supported the resolution in 1981, it was not until 1993, nearly 12 years later, that the former Attorney-General declared it under the HREOC Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actual date on which he did so is also significant: it was 8 February this year, the day after the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the federal election. Some months before, the former Attorney-General had consulted state governments. Attorney-General Hannaford of New South Wales advised that the New South Wales Liberal government opposed the incorporation of the UN declaration in the HREOC Act. So did Attorney-General Berinson QC of the Western Australian Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question must be asked: what prompted the former Attorney-General to sign his declaration 10 years after the matter had come before his government and on the day after a federal election was announced, an election which the government was generally expected to lose? In looking at the incorporation of the UN declaration in the HREOC Act, the first point to be made is that the UN declaration is not a treaty. Australia is not bound at international law to comply with the terms of the UN declaration, nor is it bound to incorporate its provisions into Australian domestic law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its adoption in 1981 means little more than that the principles sought to be stated in the declaration were accepted by Australia as a step in the process of endeavouring to reach a formal international consensus on the subject of religious intolerance and discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point to be made is that within the existing definition of human rights in the HREOC Act, the commission has ample power to promote the concept of religious freedom and to investigate infringements of that freedom by the Commonwealth or its agencies. There are significant statements about the right to freedom of religion and belief in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which is already incorporated into the definition of human rights in the HREOC Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 18(1), (2) and (3) of the international covenant state that everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and belief and the right to manifest that religion or belief and that no-one shall be subject to coercion which would impair those freedoms. This is virtually identical to article 1 of the UN declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the definition of human rights in the HREOC Act in relation to religious freedom does need extending, no justification for such extension has been offered by the government at any time. If a case were to be made, then the legislation effecting the extension should be done in the most clear and readily comprehensible language. The UN declaration does not have those qualities, as I will endeavour to demonstrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN declaration is a document in which clarity of meaning has been sacrificed for the sake of compromise. The result is a series of vague, ambiguous and potentially contradictory provisions. The declaration contains general provisions that state that everyone shall have the right to freedom of religion or belief and to manifest that religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching and that no-one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his or her freedom to have a religion or belief of his or her choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration goes further and in article 6 expressly states what those freedoms include. I will quote a few of these. One freedom is to establish and maintain appropriate charitable or humanitarian institutions. What constitutes `appropriate charitable institutions'? Another function is to make, acquire and use to an adequate extent the necessary articles and material related to the rites or customs of a religion or belief. What is `an adequate extent' and what, indeed, are necessary articles and materials as opposed to unnecessary ones? One could suggest a sacrificial dagger is, according to some rites, a necessary article. </PARA>

What are `relevant publications' in this context and what constitutes a `suitable place' in which a religion or belief may be taught? Another purported right is to train, appoint, elect or designate by succession appropriate leaders called for by the requirements and standards of any religion or belief. Who constitutes an `appropriate leader'? We have seen recent examples of totally inappropriate leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions are an attempt to codify to some degree religious rights and freedoms, but they give rise to a multitude of questions of interpretation. It is difficult to see how the commission could fulfil its functions of promoting understanding and acceptance of these alleged human rights. To give any meaning or content to them, the commission would have to engage in value judgments in respect of which the UN declaration offers no guidance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as being ambiguous and unclear, the provisions of the declaration probably conflict with the provisions of instruments already incorporated into the HREOC Act. There is probably also internal conflict between provisions of the UN declaration itself. An example is provided by provisions dealing with the religious education of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires that the state parties to the covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and legal guardians to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions. That is article 18(4). There is a similar principle stated in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child which is also incorporated in the HREOC Act in principle 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a similar vein, article 5(1) of the UN declaration provides that the parents and legal guardians of children have the right to organise the life within the family in accordance with their religion or belief and bearing in mind the moral education in which they believe the child should be brought up. However, article 5(3) of the UN declaration provides that the child shall be brought up in a spirit of understanding, tolerance, friendship among peoples, peace and universal brotherhood, respect for freedom of religion or belief of others and in full consciousness that his energy and talents should be devoted to the service of his fellow man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A parent concerned to educate his or her child in accordance with the parent's religious commitments could well find that the tenets of his or her religion are not in conformity with these requirements. In fact, article 5(3) of the UN declaration itself is almost an expression of a form of religious belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The apparently absolute rights given to parents to ensure the religious and moral education of their children is in conformity with their own convictions in the international covenant are also inconsistent with article 5(2) of the UN declaration. The latter states that whilst every child shall enjoy the right to have access to education in the matter of religion or belief in accordance with the wishes of his parents or legal guardian and shall not be compelled to receive teaching in religion or belief against their wishes, the best interests of the child are the guiding principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be suggested that the use of the term `the best interests of the child' opens the door for the overriding of parental wishes in relation to the religious education of their children. Apart from its specific terms, the declaration also raises the broader issue of governments legislating with respect to religious freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the most noble acts in history have been done in pursuit of an article of faith or a religious ideal. On the other hand, some of the most ghastly and inhuman chapters of mankind's history, even very recent history, have also been the result of uncompromising beliefs of a religious nature.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a fact that there are many religious practices and beliefs which are not acceptable to the vast majority in Australian society. In this respect, I do not refer to matters of diet, dress or hygiene. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Internationally, I suggest, the conflict between freedom of religion, on the one hand, and freedom from discrimination, on the other, is likely to become very contentious in the future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I make is that the hundreds of submissions received by opposition members and senators in relation to the UN declaration and the Attorney-General's declaration under the HREOC Act have disclosed a total lack of understanding among members of the public about the impact of Australia adopting United Nations declarations and the means by which UN declarations and conventions become part of the domestic law of Australia. Of even greater concern is that they have also disclosed an alarming lack of knowledge about the role and powers of the commission, a body which, under the proposed budget&mdash;the first version&mdash;has been allocated funds of over $17.7 million this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the coalition opposes the former Attorney-General's declaration for several reasons. The HREOC Act already incorporates significant statements on the issue of religious freedom. Another is unnecessary. Further, the history of the UN religious declaration demonstrates the difficulties inherent in its subject matter. As a result of these difficulties, the UN declaration is a vague, internally inconsistent document, the impact of which is unclear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It probably also conflicts with other instruments already incorporated under the HREOC Act, highlighting a flaw in the HREOC Act itself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should amend the HREOC Act to allow for examination of international instruments prior to their being declared in relation to the other functions of the commission.

The government should also seek to educate Australians about the functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I acknowledge the spirit in which the motion has been moved by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). He wishes there to be an opportunity, and I acknowledge that, for the parliament to be able to debate this particular instrument. It is certainly an important instrument which has been adopted by the government and which is now added to the armoury, if you like, of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It is appropriate that it be debated. Indeed, the very mechanism of this process allows a disallowance motion to occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point which the honourable member raised implied that there is something a little sinister about it all, that it was signed up in the last days of the previous government at a time when it was widely believed that the government may not be returned. Hence the implication no doubt is that it would be a bit of a shoofty, that we could slip it in early, and that it would be imposed on the incoming government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that we are debating this matter tonight and that it may be disallowed by this House, or disallowed later by the Senate&mdash;where I understand a similar disallowance motion has been put&mdash;rather puts the lie to the argument. Obviously it was not imposed on an incoming government. Had the coalition won government it could easily have disposed of this particular instrument, if it was of a mind to, and the House will vote on it tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member then went on to ask where all this came from and why, after such a long period of time, it was picked up by the government and added again to the HREOC armoury. Initial support for this declaration occurred in 1981 and came from the Fraser government, not a Labor government. The declaration was picked up in recent times because of a request by the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, who would be well known to honourable members of this House as a very distinguished Australian. He is a former justice of the High Court and a man who, I believe, would not be prone to embarking on enterprises which would somehow limit the rights and enjoyment of religious freedom in this country. He is also a man who has some knowledge of the law, both internationally and domestically, the operation of the United Nations and the impact a declaration such as the one we are debating will have on Australian law. Obviously, Sir Ronald Wilson did not see the evil which the honourable member for Tangney believes could be incorporated in this particular measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the request for the declaration was made, Australia and in fact the world was going through the Gulf War, when some concern was being directed in the Australian community at those of the Muslim faith. That was one of the major reasons that motivated the request from the human rights commission to the government to go down this path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also raised the question of consultation, implying that the whole thing was a bit rushed. He suggested that the Attorney-General of New South Wales, Mr Hannaford, and the then Attorney-General of Western Australia had expressed some concerns about the declaration and, as a result, we should have stepped back and said, `We should not proceed with it'. Of course, the honourable member did not go on to mention that that consultation was not confined to the Attorneys-General of New South Wales and Western Australia. Consultation occurred through all Attorneys-General and no objection at all was raised to the declaration by the other states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more substantive objection was raised by Attorney-General Hannaford and was based on a belief that this declaration may have an impact on some of the exemptions provided in New South Wales anti-discrimination laws to particular religious practices. Indeed, as the honourable member mentioned, it was a broader measure which means that at some time we will have to sit down and resolve the potential conflict between declarations of religious freedom like this one and anti-discrimination provisions where the actual religious belief may be discriminatory in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a matter which we should be particularly concerned about because, on the face of it, there could be conflict. They are matters of judgment and balance. But the particular point which the Attorney-General of New South Wales raised simply was not valid in that this declaration will have no impact on the laws of New South Wales. As the honourable member said, this declaration will empower the human rights commission to certainly examine the actions and practices of the Commonwealth and promote broad understanding and education in areas of religious freedom. It is certainly not an instrument which of itself can invalidate the laws of any state or any discrimination laws in New South Wales. I think that point was even acknowledged by the Attorney-General of Western Australia in his objection. I stress that the other states did not object to the declaration at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the human rights commission undertook wide consultations. As honourable members may know, Sir Ronald Wilson is well known as a senior official I think in the Uniting Church. He is also well known amongst churches generally. Obviously, in talking about things which touch on religious freedom, a first port of call must be church and religious groups in the country to get a view on the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly advised that the position related by Sir Ronald back to the government was that there is widespread support for the declaration amongst churches. That is not to say there has not been a certain amount of misinformation and misunderstanding about this declaration. Like opposition members and senators, before the election, as a backbench member, I also received letters about this matter expressing a whole range of concerns. It was similar to the campaign which was run regarding the rights of the child, and no doubt we will discuss that a little later tonight. It was also similar to a campaign which is often run about the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not deny that many right-minded people become concerned with the information or misinformation given to them and write in good faith to their members of parliament to express that concern. But I have also no doubt that a lot of this misinformation does come from some quite extreme and fringe groups in the community, from my experience at least within my home state. Often the League of Rights or kin organisations are rather prone to getting themselves involved with this issue, based on the idea that Australia is losing its sovereignty and that we are moving to a one world government. It is all tied up with the direction of the High Court in the dams case, the destruction of the legal system as we know it and Australia being brought to its knees. It used to have a communist undertone but with the collapse in Russia and eastern Europe, that undertone seems to have dropped out of the most recent letters I have seen. Nonetheless, the one-world conspiracy theory is often there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also accept a couple of points the honourable member raised: there is a great deal of ignorance in the Australian community about the United Nations. There is also a deal of ignorance about the operation of the human rights commission not only in this area but in regard to a whole lot of its responsibilities. Inasmuch as it is a government failure that this misunderstanding exists in the community, I have to accept the blame for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, these sorts of campaigns are run from time to time and do generate large volumes of mail coming into the offices of honourable members. People do have to take it for what it is. It is often driven by people believing these great conspiracy theories. One has to weigh up this sort of campaign in light of that. I have seen it in my six years in the parliament. It was very evident during the 1988 referendums and I know how very successful such campaigns can be in whipping up a lot of public fear and concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That should not distract us from looking at the issue on its merits. I do not believe that this declaration will harm us or hinder us in any way. With this instrument, HREOC has a more modern statement of basic religious rights and freedoms than that contained in the underlying document, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which also canvasses political freedoms. It enables the body to go out and promote the idea of religious freedom. I do not think that it will be trying to strike down anti-discrimination laws or questioning things&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . required additional reflection.

<PARA>because it was held in that context, and that is why I do not dispute the right to move that motion or to debate it. It went on:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the opposition moves to disallow the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, just as it has also moved to disallow the United Nations Declaration on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The National and Liberal parties have chosen this course of action because the two declarations are an insult to the Australian community, and an insult to the legal and constitutional traditions through which we conduct our affairs as an independent nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twelve years ago, it was deemed&mdash;I suspect for reason of diplomatic nicety&mdash;to endorse a set of abstract principles regarding the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. This was hardly perceived to be a problem as the principles were of no more significance than that, and they were quite some considerable distance from intruding into the domestic legal system. That is where they should have stayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current government we have seen an effort to give these principles some teeth; to pull them into the life of the community and allow them greater force in determining the shape of our own institutions. Effectively, what the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has done in respect of the declaration is to bring it within the ambit of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In other words, the ministerial declaration gazetted on 24 February this year, and tabled in both Houses in May, had the effect of drawing principles espoused in the original declaration, its variously phrased freedoms and rights in respect of religious activities, within the functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a bewildering course of action, especially as the government has already transferred the principles contained within the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights into the commission's act. I know that the government finds it exciting to trump up its little bureaucracies and flatter its political constituencies, but this really was an action akin to ministerial overkill, and it is a wholly unnecessary course to take. The declaration is a vague and imprecise instrument. It is the product of Geneva based committees and teams of UN bureaucrats with little more on their plates than to spend time confusing the obvious and needlessly interfering in the domestic affairs of nations whose observance of the principles they espouse is hardly in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we hand over a document like the Declaration of Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief to the human rights commission, we really are creating a rod for our own backs. We well know what that commission will do with an instrument like this. It will interpret it widely and raise a host of international legal concerns and unleash a whole new era of litigation upon the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the commission has no punitive powers in this instance&mdash;its powers are more declaratory than legally binding&mdash;but it does have the authority to open up a wholly new and needless bureaucracy in conciliating between parties who feel that they have been aggrieved in some way which runs counter to the spirit or intention of the declaration. We know that this will eventually open up a new and rich arena of activity for the legal profession, and gradually the international covenants and declarations, such as those under debate, will seep into the political and legal systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next we will have the courts bogged down with case loads laying claim to infringements of articles derived from UN instruments of all kinds. From documents such as this spring all kinds of implied rights and privileges which were overlooked at the time of adoption. No doubt, before long we will find the current government using the declaration as a precedent to obtain some legislative end that it could obtain anyway through recourse to our own legal and legislative channels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not simply a cynical suspicion. We all know where these seemingly harmless documents take us. It is a suspicion that a wide sway of the community shares all too well. It is not just a concern that the declaration, which is the subject of this disallowance motion, is an unnecessary encumbrance on the community. The matter goes a long way further than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter goes to the heart of the respect the community has for its own institutions and traditions. The community does not appreciate the preparedness of this government to endorse international protocols, declarations and covenants in a manner which rides roughshod over the parliament and, therefore, the electorate's own will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government might like to laugh this off&mdash;as the Attorney-General did during his contribution&mdash;and claim that this is a concern borne of ignorance or overreaction, but there is a very large slice of the community that believes that new instruments, such as this declaration, which can affect the established, legal and political and social traditions of the nation should be fully debated and reviewed and not left up to brief parliamentary debate or ministerial fiat or discretion.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This alone is one reason why the opposition parties have moved to disallow the declaration, because before the government enters into international agreements of this kind, or proposes to do so, it should not proceed without a full and open debate which elicits the cross-section of community feeling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the government can reserve for its own prerogative the important right of introducing alien legal conventions into the legal and political process without seeking prior consent or consultation. If this government is addicted to endorsing international principles such as that one contained in the declaration, then it might like to stand by this one for once: the principle of prior consultation of the parliament made up of elected representatives accountable to the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in the budget process the total disdain the government has for honesty and consultation. Now we are seeing those very same tendencies creep into the conduct of the legal system. The reasons for the coalition's disallowance motion go even deeper than this. The declaration has as its key principles such concerns as guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience and religion, the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, the right of parents to organise their family lives around religious principles, the freedom for individuals to worship as they are so inclined, and the right of individuals and groups to manifest their faiths through attending churches, organising charitable institutions and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder why the federal government has suddenly found it necessary to embrace all of these principles. I would have thought we enjoyed a strong western European tradition flowing especially from the 17th to the 19th and 20th centuries which embodied these very principles which have influenced our legal system and have set the very cultural traditions which make us an independent nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My point is that if the Attorney-General finds it necessary to reimpose these principles in the form of a foreign instrument on Australia, he should first tell the community in what way its existing conduct is deficient or defective or in what way our legal processes or prevailing customs have failed to the extent that they need to be buttressed by a contrived statement by a group of anonymous United Nations bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, of course, do not pretend that our conduct as a community has reached a point where we are free of blemishes of conduct on matters such as racial discrimination and so forth. But if there is a problem in the community which is of such severity that it requires recourse to extraterritorial laws, I am sure the public want to know what precisely the extent of this problem might be and what are its sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, even if there were a problem of the magnitude which required legislative action in some form, why would it not be possible to address this problem from within our own indigenous legal and social institutions instead of running off to employ an international instrument?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the Attorney-General really believe Australia needs and requires an artificial, borrowed, derivative statement of religious freedoms in this country in order to ensure these freedoms are observed? When contentious issues arise, be they religious in nature or concerning other civil and human rights, they should be addressed here in Australia and resolved here in Australia with recourse to our own domestic courts and traditions. There is no need, practical or otherwise, to impose a bureaucratic overlay on the local, legal and political systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a government that pretends so much to value domestic political independence and mocks any evidence of dependence on other nations, the fact that the government through these declarations is actively seeking to adopt this very course of action is untenable and inconsistent and it reveals the fundamental hypocrisies which underlie so many of its public positions on national affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a government parading its nationalist credentials while simultaneously eroding the integrity of Australian's own institutions. I would add that there is more than a little of the old Australian cringe mentality at work in all of this. The local product is obviously not good enough for the government and, in this case, the product is nothing less than the basic institutional life of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many in the community, that is what this whole issue of the government's recourse to international covenants and declarations is about. It is nothing more than an attack on the nation's sovereignty and an undermining of the electorate's ultimate authority in the political system. This is not the lament of the extremist; this is a simple fear held by many people who no longer trust anything this government does and rightly sees in its every action duplicity and guile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make one closing comment on this disallowance motion. I am perturbed, as are others in this parliament and in the wider community, that we are becoming increasingly preoccupied with finding solutions to alleged problems through legal recourse or remedies. We are becoming a society of litigants whose conduct is observed by way of contract. That is, the essential traditions and character of the nation are increasingly falling into the hands of bureaucrats and lawyers who arbitrate and conciliate on all manner of concerns. The capacity of the community to regulate its own conduct, to set its own standards and be guided by the leadership of public figures is waning as a result. That says a great deal about a lot of forces operating across society. But it also says a great deal about the role of this parliament in national life and the decline of public leadership in setting the temper of the times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than using declarations such as that we are debating tonight to pursue some internationalist dogma which has always been pumping away within the Labor movement since its formation, if this government were genuinely serious about reaffirming the basic qualities of citizenship in this country, then it should firstly and properly look to its own standards of conduct and leadership. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Following on from the point of order raised by the honourable member for Moore, I would like to add that the honourable member for Banks did refer to the honourable member for Gippsland as a throwback and that does have a pejorative and nugatory sense.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I am happy to withdraw if people take that as a reflection. I think a few facts need to be brought into this debate. I had a number of letters written to me both before and after the election. I represent a fairly conservative Labor electorate. A high percentage of people in that electorate are from a Christian background. There are a number of conservative churches in that electorate and they wrote to me because this campaign was running hot at the time. I made some inquiries of the Attorney-General's Department and checked out a few facts. I wrote a letter to each of the constituents involved and I have not had a follow-up letter from them yet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do the facts reveal? The facts reveal the following: that the original declaration was adopted and proclaimed unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly on 25 November 1981. I would have thought that if there were any division or prevarication, there would have been opposition to it; there was not. The information I have received is that it was adopted unanimously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international community is firmly behind the implementation of the religious declaration. The information I have obtained again reveals that at this year's meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, under its agenda item on the implementation of the declaration, a resolution was passed calling on states to ensure that their legal systems provide adequate guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and to take all appropriate measures to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of violence, including those motivated by religious extremism, and to encourage understanding, tolerance and respect in matters relating to freedom of religion or belief. </PARA>
<PARA>What happened? The resolution was co-sponsored by 38 countries and adopted without a vote. Those co-sponsors included Australia, Canada, Ireland&mdash;which introduced the resolution&mdash;France, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, as well as the United States of America. The facts speak for themselves. Who introduced the resolution? It was Ireland. There are not many reds under the bed in Ireland. What are we to believe from the honourable member for Gippsland? Are we to believe that Australia is such an isolated nation that we should put up the barriers? Let us erect the barricades&mdash;an eight-foot brick fence all around Australia. Is that the opposition's solution to unemployment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the history of how this resolution came into being. Where did it originate? Where did the government's action come from? The proposal to declare the religion declaration was initiated by&mdash;guess who?&mdash;Sir Ronald Wilson when he wrote a letter to the then Attorney-General on 4 March 1991. He wrote following the passage of a unanimous resolution of a meeting at the world conference for religion and peace consultation which took place in Melbourne in 1991. Guess what? It took place shortly after the Gulf War. That is significant because it was the conduct of some individuals within this country during the Gulf War that prompted Sir Ronald Wilson to write. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was an interesting sequel to the presentation of my paper on human rights from a religious viewpoint. During question time I was asked from the floor whether I thought it might be possible for the Commonwealth Government to give consideration to include the 1981 UN Declaration on the  Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief in the Commission's jurisdiction by making a declaration under section 47 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. I answered in the affirmative, whereupon there was spontaneous applause. The meeting then resolved unanimously to that effect and I was asked to bring the suggestion to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>What did Sir Ronald Wilson do? He wrote off to the then Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy). The then Attorney-General, after obviously giving Sir Ronald Wilson's proposal serious consideration, then commenced the consultation processes specified under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. He consulted with state ministers before signing the declaration. The level of consultation was obviously appropriate having regard to the commission's responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1992&mdash;this is how long it lay on the table&mdash;he wrote to all state and territory attorneys-general informing them of his intention to declare the religion declaration and invited them to raise any issues concerning the intended declaration. The attorneys-general for South Australia, ACT, Northern Territory&mdash;it appears that people from the Northern Territory are more progressive than some of the honourable members on the other side of the House&mdash;Queensland, Tasmania, and Victoria either supported the declaration or had no issues to raise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attorneys-general of Western Australian and New South Wales raised a number of concerns. The Western Australian Attorney-General was concerned about the effect of the declaration on the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Act 1984 and the exemptions provided for in that act&mdash;in particular, the exemptions granted to religious bodies in section 72. However, he recognised that this would not pose a legal problem unless the religion declaration itself was enacted by the Commonwealth. There is no intention to do this. The New South Wales Attorney-General was of the opinion that the law and practice of New South Wales did not currently comply with the requirements of the religion declaration. However, the issue of any inconsistency between state legislation and the religion declaration does not arise in the context of making the declaration under the HREOC Act. Obviously, the objections raised during the consultation period to making that declaration lacked substance. Given the attitude of the majority of state attorneys-general, I understand that the then Attorney-General decided to proceed with the declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have this letter writing campaign. What does a declaration allow the HREOC to do? It allows the commission to promote the understanding, acceptance and public discussion of the rights described in the UN declaration. The HREOC will also be able to inquire into acts or practices of the Commonwealth which are inconsistent with the rights contained in the UN declaration. What is wrong with that? Does the opposition want us to withdraw from the UN? Does it want us to be one out in the world? Why are we in the UN? The HREOC will also be able to examine Commonwealth legislation to determine whether it is consistent with the rights in the UN declaration, and it can report to the Commonwealth Attorney-General on action that should be taken by the Commonwealth on matters relating to the human rights. That is part of the answer that I gave to my constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also said&mdash;and this is important because this is where there is a misinformation that people are feeding off&mdash;that the reality is that the more they inquire or the more that it is explained to them, they will find that there is no substance to the fear or to the misinformation. The UN declaration does not restrict or limit Christians or members of other religions in the practice of their religion. The declaration and the rights recognised in it are aimed at ensuring the protection of freedom of religion. This intention is clearly reflected in two paragraphs in the preamble which states in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Considering that religion or belief for anyone who professes either is one of the fundamental elements of his conception of life and that freedom of religion or belief should be fully respected and guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that that would have been motherhood stuff, even for the opposition. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . concerned by manifestations of intolerance and by the existence of discrimination in matters of religion or belief still in evidence in some areas of the world.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, what is the objection with that? Article 1 of the UN declaration says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.</PARA>
<PARA>It says further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have a religion or belief of his choice . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is written there. It is a manifesto that we should be abiding by. The ALP has a manifesto; it has beliefs that we work to. I would have thought that the Liberal Party and the National Party also have beliefs and manifestos that they work and aspire to. The interesting thing is that those who should and do know at each stage of the process at the United Nations have let the matters go through unanimously; no votes were recorded against it. But what happens here? The politicians have to be involved, arguing the politics of the matter. They think that there might be something in it for them, that there is something else behind it. The reality is that there is nothing behind it. The declaration itself is motherhood stuff. </PARA>

On Monday of this week Sir Ronald Wilson attended a seminar conducted by the Australian Human Rights Council, which looked at human rights complaints mechanisms; why use them and how to use them. In the course of answering questions from the audience he made reference to the current disallowance motions by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) and he urged members of the audience to write to both the Attorney-General and the shadow Attorney-General protesting the disallowance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want government members to know that I am not a person that imagines a red under the bed but I am a person who has had the opportunity and the privilege of working with many people in the community. I have been brought up to take the view that we should consult widely on important issues like this and that we should take account of the views of people even if we do not necessarily always regard their views as being right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an issue which the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) himself says is going to have no legal effect at all but which is designed to act as an educational tool that is to shape the minds and the attitudes of people in the future&mdash;and that means future parliamentarians, future policy makers, future legislators, future members of tribunals appointed, for example, for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the states and the Commonwealth. It is designed to influence the thoughts and the attitudes of Australians, both this present generation and future decision makers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, I know from my experience in state parliament, as a minister and shadow minister, and now as a member of the House of Representatives that once people have had their attitudes moulded, shaped and educated, if they are given the opportunity to influence laws they naturally put into the formation of the laws the views that they have developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst of course I agree with Sir Ronald Wilson&mdash;I know of his eminence and respect him very much&mdash;I must say that I do not believe Sir Ronald would ever want anyone to think that he is saying to Australians and to this parliament that what we decide tonight in respect of what should become an educational tool could not at any time influence the shape and the formation of the law in the future. Of course he would not want to be associated with that because education is part of the shaping of policy makers and law makers. Obviously it influences the people who are in the courts, the judges and the magistrates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that we ought to have a look at this motion of disallowance by taking a different view from that which has been advanced, unfortunately, by the honourable member for Banks. I have approached this with an open mind, and decided that I would consult with people in my electorate to get their views. I wrote to all of the church groups in Indi and surrounding areas, and I am glad to say I received quite a few replies. Some people said they did not see anything wrong with it; others had quite strong views and felt that it unwittingly&mdash;not deliberately&mdash;transgressed on something that they felt was pretty important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example of that, I received a letter dated 9 July 1993&mdash;a copy of which I am happy to make available to members&mdash;from Bishop Daly, the Bishop of Sandhurst, who is very highly respected in Australia. After the introduction, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I like other constituents have concerns regarding the above Declaration, and I forward the following brief comments for your perusal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article One</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his/her freedom to have a religion or belief of his/her choice. Non Catholic Students attend Catholic Schools, and under this article they could maintain that their Religious beliefs are not catered for, also they could maintain that they will not abide by that Schools regulations with regard to Christian principles, and could maintain they are being coerced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Freedom to manifest one's religion or belief may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. This article allows for Governments (secular persons) to intervene on Religious matters and arbitrate for the individual, which might not necessarily be to the benefit of the community as a whole. Minority religious groups could claim discrimination by larger Religious Groups e.g. Government Assistance by way of grants etc.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a very important point. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article Two</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Religious Schools generally will employ people with Christian values, for the most part having the same beliefs. This article will cause concern to the Principals, parents and students of religious schools, given that currently under the Equal Opportunity Act an exemption for religious bodies under the Act (section 38) implies religious schools can find a person unsuitable because he/she leads an obvious lifestyle or has publicly held beliefs which are in conflict with the Religious Teachings of said religious schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Religious Schools will not be able to say who attends their schools, be it teachers/students regardless of their beliefs. This article could eventually&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise `eventually'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have religion banned as part of the curriculum given that minority teacher/students believe they can be coerced by weight of numbers into conforming to the Religious teachings of said school.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article Four</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All States shall take effective measures to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion. Effectively Governments could make State/Church education systems one&mdash;with no religion taught in schools. Possible reason given that no one religion covers all beliefs. Religion therefore has no place in school's curriculum. For the most part Catholic Schools have been built by the donations of Catholics believing that their children's education will not be complete unless christian values are taught at the school level as well as in the home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this Declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bishop Daly</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bishop of Sandhurst.</PARA>
<PARA>His comments and the comments on my file from the Wodonga District Baptist Church, the Wangaratta Baptist Church, the Wodonga Ministers Fraternal, St Cuthbert's Rectory at Yarrawonga, the Assemblies of God in Australia, the Grace Presbyterian Church in Wodonga, the Salvation Army Benalla Corps, the Wangaratta Church of Christ and the Wangaratta parish of the Uniting Church have also, in various ways, expressed concern about the wording of the declaration. Members of the Beechworth Community Church, Our Lady's Parish Wangaratta and Glenrowan, the Uniting Church of Benalla, the Anglican Church of All Saints in Bright, the Uniting Church in Wangaratta and the Anglican Church of Yackandandah have told me that they have no problem with the declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am trying to be even-handed. The Attorney-General says, `Relax, it will not have the effect of law; do not worry about it'. I am quite sure that he is sincere in what he is saying. Equally, it is important to say, `Why do we not accept the disallowance motion of the shadow Attorney-General and allow further consultation and allow such groups to be brought in to discuss the matter and perhaps make some changes?'. That is the basis on which I support the motion of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). It is worthy of further discussion and we have to take account of these views. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will reply briefly to comments by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). The honourable member for Banks seems to think that, if he replies to a letter from a constituent rejecting what the constituent has asserted, the constituent accepts it because the constituent does not do anything more about it. That is not a reason for suggesting that the concerns of those people who write letters to honourable members and senators on this subject are not genuine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Banks pointed to the fact that the original declaration was adopted unanimously in the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1981. He neglected to point out that the negotiation and drafting of that document by then had taken 19 years. The similarity between that and the current budget proposal, with its tortuous negotiation and flexible terms, is apparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Banks also mentioned the original request from Sir Ronald Wilson regarding the declaration. For the record, his correct name is Sir Ronald Wilson, not Sir Roland Wilson, as he has been called tonight on a number of occasions. One would not doubt his integrity or intentions in making his request. The dramatic circumstances which prompted him to make that request for the declaration highlight that the push for this declaration does not come from within Australia. He was responding to the request of a world congress for religion and peace. Internationally, there is justification for an inadequate document being promoted for the purposes for which it is used. Within Australia, there is no similar need. We do not have a problem with child prostitution or child slavery as there is in some other countries. An international request for domestic law can be responded to only by reference to domestic requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Banks read passages from the declaration as if they constituted an argument in favour of the incorporation of the declaration in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. The passages he read, except for the preamble, are in identical terms in the ICCPR. They are not the passages to which I have objected in my comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the comments of the Attorney-General, the reason for the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), signing the declaration to enable its operation under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act was identified as being the circumstances at the time of the Gulf War. At that time incidents were reported of individuals of non-Muslim faith interfering with women, particularly of Muslim faith, wearing purdah, the Muslim dress. The promulgation of the declaration under the HREOC Act has no effect on that. That is one of the points made by the Attorney-General himself. In order to meet the express need, all we need to do is rely on the provisions of the ICCPR which promote religious tolerance in general terms. We do not need to go to the further detail, because it has no relevance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ICCPR gives HREOC as much as it needs to promote an acceptance and understanding in general terms of religious tolerance. We do not need provisions about necessary materials for appropriate rights to an adequate extent and other verbiage contained in the rest of the declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General mentioned that the declaration had no impact on the laws of New South Wales, as addressed by Attorney-General Hannaford and the then Western Australian Attorney-General, Mr Berinson. It is not asserted by us that it does. But it has to be remembered that two functions of the commission are relevant: the promotion of an acceptance and understanding of human rights and a function of investigating complaints of breaches or infringements of human rights by Commonwealth authorities and agencies. If the Commonwealth, through its agency, the commission, is to promote an understanding and acceptance of human rights and religious freedom and tolerance in particular, it should not be doing it in a way that gives rise to a conflict with state legislation. That is the point made by the two Attorneys-General. That point has not been answered in any way by the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General mentioned, as I did not, that there has been a lot of misinformation from extreme and fringe groups. That is accepted. But the argument does not rely upon arguments put by those groups in the community. The arguments are based on substance and not on fear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General also suggested that under the declaration the commission will not be pushing onto people social philosophy of its own invention. But the point must be made again that one of the functions of the commission is to promote an acceptance and understanding of religious tolerance and freedom. It does that by reference to whatever instruments are declared under the act. Prior to the declaration on 8 February, it did it by reference to the ICCPR; now it does it by reference to the declaration. What is being promoted is not the commission's version of social philosophy but that which is set out in the declaration. That is why it is so important to have regard to the terms of the declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General passed off as if it were of no moment that there may be conflicts between the instruments already declared under the act. The opposition's view is that that should be resolved before a declaration is made. It would be a simple matter if the government did its job rather than wait to let the commission do the job by promoting inconsistent policies within the Australian community. In nothing that has been said by the government is there an answer to the arguments put by the opposition in favour of this motion. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">disallows the declaration by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA>Like the previous motion, this motion relates to a declaration made by the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), under subsection 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, the HREOC Act, in this case with respect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The effect of this declaration was to bring the rights and freedoms recognised in the UN convention within the definition of `human rights' for the purposes of that act and the general functions of the commission with respect to human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, I wish to make it clear that the coalition is not opposed to the convention itself. This has always been the case. In this regard, I refer to the speech made by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) in this House on 21 February 1991, just after ratification of the convention by Australia. In that speech it was made clear that the coalition, had it been in government, would have ratified the convention, but would have done so with reservations to particular articles of the convention so as to make its interpretation crystal clear. The coalition, therefore, in bringing this motion is not attacking the convention, but is rather questioning its incorporation into the HREOC Act in light of its ratification by Australia without any reservations as to its interpretation. It should also be understood that the coalition is not seeking by this motion to criticise the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The origins of the convention can be traced back to the Declaration of Geneva on the rights of the child, which was adopted by the League of Nations in 1924 in response to the needs of children after World War I. That declaration contained five principles which were general but to the point. For example, one was that children should be the first to receive relief in an emergency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations adopted its own Declaration of the Rights of the Child in 1959, which enunciates 10 principles to guide parents, governments and voluntary organisations in their treatment of children. These principles include: non-discrimination on grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion or political opinion; enjoyment of special treatment under the law; entitlement to a name and nationality at birth; enjoyment of social security benefits; provision of education; and protection against neglect, cruelty and exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1979 the United Nations Human Rights Committee commenced drafting a convention dealing with children's rights. The resulting convention on the rights of the child was unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 November 1989 and came into force internationally upon receiving its 20th ratification on 2 September 1990. Prior to the ratification of this convention by Australia, there was great concern in Australia about the potential effect of the convention on family life in this country. There was particular concern about its potential to undermine parental rights and responsibilities, particularly in so far as these rights concern education, religion, association with others and privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The articles in the convention relevant to these issues, being articles 12 to 16 inclusive and article 28, contain no express recognition of the primary rights and responsibilities of parents, but appear to give absolute rights to the child. The Holy See, when it ratified the convention, made a reservation to the effect that it would interpret the articles of the convention in a way that safeguards the primary and inalienable rights of parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 7 November 1990, prior to ratification of the convention by Australia, the then Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, referring to the reservations to the convention made by the Holy See, advised the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Australian Government ratifies the convention, should it do so, one would find that those same understandings as to the pre-eminent role of the family would be acknowledged. It would be surprising were that not the case . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contrary to this statement, on 17 December 1990 the government ratified the convention with no such reservation. I note that ratification took place whilst there was a motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> to be moved by the honourable member for Kooyong calling on the government to undertake that, in the event that the convention was ratified by Australia, reservations would be lodged to protect the inalienable rights of the parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actions of the government in ratifying the treaty prior to that motion being debated ensured that there was no discussion of the convention in this House prior to its ratification. It was simply presented as a fait accompli. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns regarding those key articles of the convention and how they affect parental rights have resurfaced with the incorporation of the convention into the HREOC Act. Prior to ratification of the convention by Australia, Senator Evans responded to those concerns by dismissing them as `lunatic misapprehensions'. This did absolutely nothing to set the minds of the public at rest. The only concession to these concerns in this House were references by government representatives to the preamble and article 5 of the convention and to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which sets out rules for the interpretation of international treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preamble contains a general statement about the family, stating that, as the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and particularly children, it should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the community. Article 5 states that the parties to the convention shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or persons legally responsible for the child to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognised in the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, these provisions fall short of providing the clear-cut interpretation of the convention that an express reservation as to the rights of parents would have provided. What appear to be absolute rights of children set out in articles 12 to 16 and 28 are arguably not sufficiently qualified by the vague reference to the family in the preamble. Nor are they by article 5, which recognises the rights of parents to guide their children in the exercise of the rights recognised under the convention but does not, in its terms, qualify the rights themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lawyers specialising in international law in the Attorney-General's Department may be aware of, and have access to, the Vienna convention. But the simple fact is that those in the community who will be looking at the convention and attempting to interpret it, such as social workers, law enforcement officers and parents, are likely never to have heard of the Vienna convention, much less to have the skills required to interpret it and apply it to the convention on the rights of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of ratification, Australia is now bound at international law by the terms of this convention. The convention on the rights of the child obliges Australia to `respect and ensure' the rights recognised in the convention and to do so `without discrimination of any kind'. Specifically article 4 requires that states `undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative, and other measures for the implementation of the rights recognised'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, the subject matter of the convention on the rights of the child is already the subject of wide-ranging legislation in Australia. According to an April 1989 paper prepared by a working group on behalf of the Australian Council of Social Service, existing government law and policies appeared generally consistent with the articles of the convention. That report also pointed out that, because there is no specification of what is meant by terms such as social security, nor any detailing of other requirements, it is difficult to determine clearly the question of compliance in relation to particular issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1989, Justice Elizabeth Evatt of the Australian Law Reform Commission indicated that in order to bring Australian laws into basic conformity with the convention it might be necessary for legislative action to be taken in many areas, including family law, marriage, children's legal services, social security and adoption. Despite these observations, ratification of the convention took place without the passage of enabling legislation either at the state or territory level or the Commonwealth level. When questioned by Senator Durack on 22 November 1989 as to whether the government had examined state child welfare laws in relation to many of the matters covered by the convention and made any judgment about their adequacy to protect the rights of Australian children, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) stated that in the government's judgment no Australian law was in contravention of the provisions of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of announcing ratification of the convention, Senator Gareth Evans and the Attorney-General again confidentially stated that state and territory laws already enable Australia to meet all the obligations that the convention would impose, subject to one exception which was the subject of a reservation, namely that child and adult criminal offenders be imprisoned separately. It seems that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Australian Council of Social Service were not convinced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 they engaged the Public Interest Advocacy Centre to conduct a six-month review into the implications of the convention for Australian law and practice relating to children. I understand that this review has yet to be finished and has been put on the backburner for the time being, reflecting the difficulties involved in actually interpreting the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has therefore bound Australia to a convention where it is unclear whether Australian laws comply with it or what legislative changes are needed to enable Australia to comply with it at Commonwealth, state and territory levels. These are issues which should have been fully explored prior to ratification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one should argue with the general objectives of the UN convention, namely, to prevent the exploitation of children and to ensure their rights are recognised. The convention is directed towards preventing such dreadful practices as child prostitution and slavery and towards ensuring adequate representation of children in legal proceedings and for other desirable objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, given the lack of clarity of the terms of the convention and the acknowledged difficulties in interpreting it, given the government's failure to make an express reservation at the time of ratification that would have clarified the meaning of crucial articles of the convention, and given the widespread concern that this has generated in the community, its wholesale incorporation into the HREOC Act is highly undesirable. As with the UN religious declaration, the incorporation of the convention under the HREOC Act also illustrates the unsatisfactory structure of the HREOC Act alluded to earlier this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The functions of the commission are set out in section 11 of that act and include the examination of a relevant international instrument in order to ascertain whether there are any inconsistencies between that instrument and any other international instruments already incorporated into the definition of human rights in that act. Relevant international instruments are defined to be those declared under section 47 of the act. In so declaring an instrument under the act, it also brings the rights and freedoms recognised in the instrument within the other functions of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those functions include inquiring into any act or practice of the Commonwealth or its agencies which may be contrary to the rights and freedoms recognised in the instrument, promoting an understanding and acceptance of those rights in Australia and reporting to the minister as to what laws should be made by the Commonwealth or action that should be taken by the Commonwealth in relation to those rights. Thus, by declaring an instrument under the HREOC Act, the commission is given the function of promoting rights and freedoms which may&mdash;and on my analysis almost certainly do&mdash;conflict with rights in other instruments already under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anomaly is that the act creates a situation where the commission does not have the power to examine an international instrument to see whether it is inconsistent with an instrument already incorporated in the act unless the commission is put in the position of having to promote both instruments. Given the uncertainty that presently exists as to whether Australian laws are in compliance with the convention, the commission may be obliged to promote rights and freedoms recognised in the convention which are in fact inconsistent with existing Australian laws&mdash;a ludicrous situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with the United Nations religious declaration, the submissions received by the opposition in relation to this convention have revealed a serious lack of understanding amongst hundreds of members of the public about the impact of Australia ratifying United Nations conventions, the means by which they become part of the domestic law of Australia, the role and powers of the commission and the effect of declaring international instruments under the HREOC Act. The government has failed to educate and inform the community about how the convention will impact upon family life in Australia and is consequently responsible for causing deep and widespread concern in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What should occur is that the ministerial declaration under the HREOC Act should be disallowed pursuant to this motion. The government should then do what it should have done years ago. It should carefully review the convention and ascertain whether Australian laws&mdash;Commonwealth, state or territory&mdash;are consistent with its provisions when correctly interpreted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should enact any legislation required pursuant to that review and request the states or territories to do the same. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) should give careful consideration to whether, in light of the relevant legislation, any declaration under the HREOC Act is necessary. If the prior steps are appropriately implemented, he should be able to conclude that such a declaration is unnecessary. The government should support this motion and then do its job properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for McPherson is quite mistaken. If he had been listening to the shadow Attorney-General, he would have heard him refer to a debate in this chamber. In fact, it was a speech by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). So the honourable member should not contradict his own spokesman on the matter. It has been debated in this House, it has been debated in the Senate and it has been debated in Senate estimates committees at some length. In fact, it was raised at Senate estimates committees quite recently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean that it should not be debated, but I do not believe that at this stage we should be trying to disallow the whole instrument. The honourable member for Tangney has stated as a starting point that, firstly, the coalition does not oppose the convention but does oppose certain aspects of it&mdash;most particularly the fact that there is not a reservation to a number of the articles. The idea of a reservation would be to make it clear that the rights of the children canvassed in these particular articles must be read in light of the pre-eminence to be given to the family in the role of parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two lines were advanced in support of this argument. The first line was that former Senator Tate, when questioned about this matter in the Senate, basically gave an undertaking that there would be such a reservation and that reservation was not made. The honourable member quoted Senator Tate, but he did not finish the quote&mdash;in fact he finished halfway through the sentence. The honourable member quoted Senator Tate as saying, `It would be surprising were that not the case'&mdash;implying that there was a full stop. In fact, that was a comma. Senator Tate then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . given the fact that Australia inserted article 5, meaning that for the first time in the international community a document was open to ratification which recognised that pre-eminent role of the family, parents or legal guardians in giving guidance and direction to children in accordance with their evolving capacities.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate was saying that the government recognised the pre-eminent importance of parents in the family. Indeed, Australia was instrumental in inserting article 5, which inserted this requirement into the convention in the first place, and it would be surprising if Australia were not completely and totally supportive of it. I think it is a little bit misleading to attribute that to former Senator Tate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go on from that point, the next line of argument was that the Holy See had made such a reservation and this was evidence that Australia should likewise have had such a reservation. As much as I have been able to ascertain from the checks my department has been able to do&mdash;I do not pretend that this may be absolutely gospel&mdash;no other country has made a reservation along the lines being proposed by the honourable member tonight and by the coalition over the last couple of years. The Holy See has, but none of the well over 100 or so countries which have ratified this convention has made a similar reservation. Despite the honourable member saying it was only arguable whether the convention has to be interpreted in light of the preamble in article 5, no-one else seems to have the same difficulty in interpreting the preamble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not be so timid and meek about the ability of the human rights commission or governments&mdash;or courts, if it came down to that&mdash;to actually interpret this document properly. It is quite clear that the document has to be read as a whole, and that article 5 does mean that those specific articles referring to education, religion, privacy and what-have-you, as the honourable member mentioned, are to be read in accordance with that particular article. As best as I have been able to determine, other countries have not considered it necessary to put such a motion. I have enough confidence in Australians, in our institutions and in the human rights commission to believe also that such a reservation is not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other line of argument that the honourable member advanced was that the correct procedure which should be followed with ratifications and when adding instruments to the armoury of the human rights commission is to undergo a check to see whether all Australian laws comply with the test which will be set down by this particular convention. Only if all the laws did in fact comply would we then add the convention to the human rights commission's armoury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that, the honourable member skirted rather quickly around the fact that Australia is a federation. Obviously the Commonwealth has control over its own laws and actions, but it has far less control&mdash;nor should it have control&mdash;over the laws and actions of state governments. While it may well be sound practice for an examination to be undertaken of the existing law of the country to check whether the convention is complied with, I do not believe it is any argument at all to say that we think a law in Tasmania or a law operating in Queensland may not comply and therefore we will not ratify or take any further action on this convention until the parliament of that state amends its laws accordingly. If that were the case, honestly, the Commonwealth would never do anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and time again we have found in this country that it is somewhat difficult to get all the states to agree on a particular course of action at any particular time. Surely that is the very reason why we have a body like the human rights commission, with the power to undertake broad investigations and examinations of the state of Australian laws, so that such deficiencies which may exist can be identified and brought to public attention and so that scrutiny can be brought to bear on laws when they are inadequate. Surely that is one of the reasons why the commission is there in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For us, at this stage, to go down the path which is being proposed tonight I believe would subject this country to some ridicule. I have to say that that is not just my opinion. I would like to read to the House a letter I received today from the Law Council of Australia&mdash;a body with which the shadow Attorney-General would be quite familiar and, I have no doubt, for which he has high regard and respect. This letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Attorney-General</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will be aware of the notice of motion&mdash;which I understand is to be debated later today&mdash;given by the Shadow Attorney-General, Mr Williams, calling for disallowance of a declaration by the Attorney-General that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is an international instrument relating to human rights and freedoms for the purposes of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Law Council is concerned that the motion, if adopted, may prevent the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission from fully carrying out its responsibilities under the Convention, or at least may limit the Commission's role in relation to the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Law Council believes adoption of the motion would be embarrassing to Australia. Further, it would cut across and undermine much of what was achieved and agreed upon at the recent World Congress on Family Law and Children's Rights, held in Sydney, which the Law Council and LAWASIA sponsored.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Congress called upon all governments which have not yet done so to give immediate and serious consideration to the ratification and implementation of the Convention. It also called on all governments to establish, develop and support at the national, regional and international levels effective, independent machinery to monitor compliance with the rights prescribed in the Convention, and to provide adequate resources to enable that machinery to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Australia to take the step contemplated in Mr Williams' motion would, the Law Council believes, be most unfortunate and would be likely to hold Australia up to ridicule in the international community. We believe the Convention sets out the rights of children in a proper and commendable way, and we do not believe it holds any threat to the rights of parents to fulfil their obligations to their children, or any threat to the family, as alleged in the motion. Indeed, in several specific provisions particular weight is given to the central role of parents in guiding and supporting children in the exercise and protection of those rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We understand that the Convention is supported by a wide range of organisations in Australia, including the Uniting Church Social Responsibility Committee, the Australian Early Childhood Association, the Youth Affairs Council, and others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With best wishes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Mansfield</PARA>
<PARA>John Mansfield QC is the Acting President of the Law Council. I commend the views of the Law Council to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important convention. The actions of the government have been appropriate. Indeed, a response is currently being prepared, as the honourable member alluded to, in terms of Australia's compliance with the convention. It has not, as the honourable member suggested, been placed on the backburner or been found to be too hard due to problems of interpretation or anything of the sort. The government's response is currently with state governments in order that the response be a truly representative response of the governments of this nation. Other responses have been prepared, one by non-government organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, some laws have been identified that&mdash;in the views of some of these non-government organisations&mdash;need to be changed. Those laws I think relate in particular to provisions dealing with wards of the state, care and control orders which come under state laws and, indeed, the actions of governments&mdash;state governments in particular&mdash;in protecting and enhancing the rights of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not deny the honourable member's genuine belief that the document may be imprecisely drafted in some way, or interpreted in contrast with some other instruments also before HREOC. But, for goodness sake, I do not believe that is a ground for saying that we should disallow the instrument and go down the path which the honourable member is suggesting. I do not believe that is a practical course for us to be adopting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not support the motion for the disallowance of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child because, obviously, I support the inclusion of the definition of `human rights' concerning the declaration of the rights of the child in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. I do so because it is very important indeed that we have the right signals in relation to the protection of children both inside and outside Australia. We should join the international community in sending those signals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In opposing this motion I refer to a reservation that the originator of the motion said might have been contemplated when the treaty was ratified by the Australian government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a reservation was not made acknowledging the pre-eminent role of the family so that in effect the Articles of the Convention would be interpreted in a way that safeguarded the primary and inalienable rights of parents;</PARA>
<PARA>A very significant change was made and included in article 5 at the request of the Australian government. However, I go back to the definition of what would be the `primary and inalienable rights of parents'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose we could come to some sort of broad definition of `primary' but what would be `inalienable'? Parents have rights that are not inalienable. A parent may not deny a child an education; a parent may not injure a child. If a parent does either of those things, those children can be taken away by the state. It is not an inalienable right to injure children, and so it would be very difficult to insert those definitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the Human Rights Commissioner said? I quote from a communication that he sent to members in the latter part of last month:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, the family generally provides the best protection for the rights of children. However, families often need assistance to help them fulfil their responsibilities. Tragically, tens of thousands of children in Australia lack the protection of a family at all. For these reasons this Commission strongly supports the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</PARA>
<PARA>Why would he do that? We should read the convention if we ask that question. From the preamble to the convention I selected this paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding.</PARA>
<PARA>Another paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising that, in all countries in the world, there are children living in exceptionally difficult conditions, and that such children need special consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 2 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status, activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs of the child's parents, legal guardians, or family members.</PARA>
<PARA>However, article 5 covers the question of a reservation. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or, where applicable, the members of the extended family or community as provided for by local custom, legal guardians or other persons legally responsible for the child, to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognised in the present Convention.</PARA>
<PARA>That is as clear a definition of family responsibility for children as one can consistently and sensibly put in there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I obtained from the library a research paper which goes through the various aspects applying the convention to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It is worth reading this matter into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> because it simplifies something which has been very much complicated by members of the public&mdash;often out of fear and at the instigation of people who know nothing of what they write in protest&mdash;and by some members of parliament. The research paper says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These words `human rights' are used in the Act in order to define the functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission . . . they include the function of examining enactments or bills for the purposes of ascertaining whether they are inconsistent with any human right, and inquiring into and endeavouring to conciliate complaints where the Commission considers that an act or practice may be inconsistent with any human right. The Commission may report to the Minister upon any action which the Commission considers needs to be taken by Australia in order to comply with the provisions of any `international instrument' and it may prepare and publish guidelines for the avoidance of acts or practices which are inconsistent with or contrary to any human right. The Commission is also granted educative, research and promotional functions in relation to human rights, and the right, with the leave of the court, to intervene in any proceedings that involve human rights issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be stressed that the declaration of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Convention on the Rights of the Child</EMPHASIS> or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Declaration on Religious Discrimination</EMPHASIS> as `international instruments' for the purposes of the Act does not make them part of Australian domestic law&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . does not make them part of Australian domestic law . . . The only redress that an individual may have for the breach of his or her human rights as identified in these documents is to complain to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>So we are not dealing with law as passed by this parliament. Any action to be taken once this is included in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act will have to be taken by Australian legislators in this place. What are we talking about? From where has this fog generated? Why has it been generated?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had long, wide, constructive public argument about the dangers of this measure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A constituent came into my office in Bendigo today. His name is Mr Andrew. He lives in Bendigo and is married. He has one child. His wife works in a government job earning about $27,000 a year. Mr Andrew is unemployed and has been for some time. He qualified for the jobstart allowance, having been out of work for six months. He finally got a job and the employer collected the jobstart subsidy. When the subsidy ran out after the 16-week period, Mr Andrew says that he lost his job because the employer could not afford to pay the full wage, although Mr Andrew was kept on for a further two weeks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer tonight to two historians. Firstly, I refer to the recent controversy with respect to the Australian historian Manning Clark that was initiated by an article by Peter Ryan in that well-known journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS>. I would like to say that that particular attack was essentially a politically motivated attack which comes from what I would describe as the old Right within the Australian community, which has for a long time felt very keenly the lack of intellectuals in the literary and historical arena on the right of the political spectrum. That part of the community has been keen to ensure that people such as Manning Clark, who has been seen to have essentially Left-oriented perspectives on Australian history in society, should be denigrated and torn down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly one can put forward evidence that Manning Clark made some inaccurate references in some of his volumes. His style was a bit florid, but there is no doubt that there have been many Australians who have been inspired to an interest and a love of Australian history by Manning Clark's works. I, like numerous other people in this House, studied some of his works as a student. They have certainly been an inspiration to people who, in earlier days, had been brought up on history that essentially regarded Australia as a footnote to the British empire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time, we had a historian who was pursuing an independent and nationally identifiable orientation with Australian history. So I would like to place on record my deep disappointment at Mr Peter Ryan's attack, and to indicate that it is in keeping with his previously expressed political views in a number of other areas. It is essentially a politically motivated attack with limited substance. I suggest to the House the fact that Manning Clark may have, on one or two occasions, actually committed the severe crime of being a bit drunk before a lecture is hardly the basis to impugn his reputation as a historian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other historian that I would like to refer to is somebody whom honourable members opposite have probably never heard of, but never mind, and that is E.P. Thompson. Edward Palmer Thompson, amongst other achievements, was vice-president of the campaign for nuclear disarmament in England. He was also a founding member of the European nuclear disarmament movement, and the author of the seminal work <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Making of the English Working Class</EMPHASIS>, which was published in 1963. He was also a lecturer at the University of Warwick in England. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">E.P. Thompson inspired and influenced a whole generation of historians, not only in England but in other countries, including Australia. I feel it is appropriate that his passing on the weekend be noted in this way because he has made a substantial contribution to intellectual debate, not only in his own country but in Europe and in this country as well. He was also a leading figure in a great international cause&mdash;nuclear disarmament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last few months, what has been overlooked in the debate that we have had on Mabo&mdash;the claims and counterclaims&mdash;is the future and the plight of 20,000 Australians who are of South Sea Islander descent. I mention this because it has been in only the recent five to six years that these people have been segregated further still, falling outside the limb of any assistance they might have had available under ATSIC in the past. Not being indigenous people, they have now been sidelined, and they are probably the most deprived of the ethnic groups in Australia. As I have said, I understand that there are about 15,000 to 20,000 of these Australians in this situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the last couple of months, and in amongst the Mabo dispute, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission has published the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The call for recognition</EMPHASIS>. The main points of that report are set out in a statement <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human rights report on South Sea Islanders</EMPHASIS>, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . recognise Australian South Sea Islanders as a unique minority group severely disadvantaged by racial discrimination, according to that report . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .           . . .          . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the report concludes that Australia's South Sea Islanders have suffered from a century of racial discrimination and harsh treatment. This has contributed to their being one of the most disadvantaged groups in Australia. School retention, employment skills, home ownership and health are identified as areas of particular need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report also notes that governments have denied South Sea Islanders recognition as a distinct black minority group. Until recently it was common for South Sea Islanders to access government programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. However this access is now being denied and the South Sea Islanders are being forced into mainstream programs which are culturally inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>This report calls for action&mdash;and awaits the action&mdash;by both state and federal governments. The Queensland government also has a responsibility in this regard. In my own area, there are an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 people who are descendants of what used to be known as a proud Kanaka race. Their history is a very proud one as far as the development of the sugar industry and their community are concerned, and the means by which they have accepted Christianity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have kept their heritage and have kept their traditions, yet they are being denied any access to what had been mainstream programs. Certainly their traditions and culture are there. I would like to put on record that probably one of the greatest contributors from the South Sea Islander community presently captains the Australian Kangaroos. I think that is a mark of respect to the man himself, and also his acknowledgment of the people he represents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of discrimination against these people by older Australians is not a proud one. If honourable members look back to the  blackbirding from the islands from 1875 onwards, they might recall the savage repatriation of these people to the islands when there was a tremendous and indiscriminate loss of life. That was the first discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because they are not indigenous people, they have no entitlement under ATSIC. There is a discrimination, as the report indicates, in housing, health, legal affairs and education. I mention legal affairs particularly because they do not have access to ATSIC legal services. Another point is that there is no recognition of these people as a significant ethnic group as there is with many others within the community. So I say without a doubt that the South Sea Islanders are a most disadvantaged group within our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a particularly good friend of South Sea Islander extraction&mdash;Mr Noel Fatnowna, who died early in 1991. He was one of the recognised citizens of Mackay. I do not say `black citizens'; I say `recognised citizens'. He was recognised for his voluntary work, his help within the ambulance service and everything else that was associated with things we like to call good in Australia. He had a book written, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fragments of a Lost Heritage</EMPHASIS>, which details the history of South Sea Islanders in Australia&mdash;how they came here and what has been their lot since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had the one common theme that if we live in Australia we are all Australians. But in fact these people are not being treated as we are treated, although he was proud to be an Australian. I think it is very important that the six recommendations in the report be acted upon quickly in order that we can end this discrimination and bring these people into mainstream Australia so that they can confidently be called proper and proud Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the most memorable and inspiring events I have attended since becoming the member for Leichhardt occurred one afternoon last April on Thursday Island in the Torres Strait, in my electorate. On that day I represented the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and presented the government's position and sat in on several workshops to develop a Torres Strait health strategy. It was an inspiring occasion for me because of the dedication and determination that I sensed in the participants. There was a sense of new opportunities opening up and a resolve to turn around unacceptable health statistics by adopting local control at the community level. To be frank, the statistics are totally unacceptable by any standards. The current life expectancy of the people of the Torres Strait region is some 23 years less than for people in the rest of Australia and Torres Strait women have a life expectancy that is 30 years less.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three-day workshop in April was a forum for presenting and discussing the requirements and priorities of the Torres Strait community. There were representatives from community and government organisations, health workers, island council chairmen and individuals concerned with the current health status and facilities provided in the region. The primary aim was to gather information from individuals on exactly what health issues need to be addressed and to determine the most effective and culturally appropriate manner in which to address them. This information was gathered together and presented in one document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the pleasure on Thursday Island to represent both the Queensland Minister for Health, the Hon. Ken Hayward, and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) in accepting this strategy on behalf of the Commonwealth and state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Congratulations for this document are in order, especially to Mr Alan Mosby, a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, who more or less launched the policy, and Elle Gafney, who spoke ably of her long fight for adequate health services in the Torres Strait. A special mention also goes to Mrs Flo Kennedy and Mr Phillip Mills, the executive officer of the Torres sector of the regional area health authority, who was the driving force behind this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local people taking control and responsibility was a strong focus of the workshop and is therefore essential to this strategy. It is a principle which I wholeheartedly support. I was delighted to hear that the Torres Strait Health Council is already developing proposals that implement this idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eight areas were addressed in the workshop, including environment, housing and infrastructure which is a vitally important matter in the Torres Strait. We cannot have proper health facilities if we do not have proper housing, if we have overcrowded housing and if we do not have sewerage services. The other areas discussed were nutrition, access to health services, community involvement and traditional culture, alcohol and substance abuse, women's health, infectious diseases and mental health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the people of the Torres Strait for putting together this strategy. It is part of the Commonwealth government's national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health strategy. It is vitally important, because of the statistics that I have referred to earlier, that the government give total support to this strategy. I will be doing everything I can to urge both state and federal governments to support the people of the Torres Strait so that we can do something about the appalling health statistics to which I referred earlier. </PARA>

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is an issue about which I have had great concern for a long time. My concerns are not for the generality of the convention, which I absolutely and heartily support. The convention is a document which was long years in the making and long years later than it should have held birth. Unfortunately, in a great rush at the end, I believe that those fine gentlemen, the bureaucrats who put together the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, made a few mistakes in English. Those mistakes in English have created great concern in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have files in my office over 12 inches thick consisting of letters from concerned parents and individuals, church groups and others within the community&mdash;not right wing ideologues&mdash;who want to make sure that they will continue to be able to exercise their rights as parents to give direction, comfort and succour to their children without overt action by the state. There are a number of articles, being specifically 12 to 16, which if read in isolation from either the preamble or article 5 could give cause to their rise for concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) tonight stated that this was an issue that was well canvassed and debated in this House. The convention itself was ratified by the government without recourse to this House in December 1990. Subsequently, the then shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), raised the issue in private members time on Thursday morning and two speakers from each side were allowed to debate the issue briefly. It has not had wide canvass or debate in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have in my possession 12 inches of files of concern by constituents in my electorate and I am unable to address the issues in this parliament. Those concerns are real. We have too frequently seen parents disappointed by actions taken by state communities. Many parents seem not to trust the convention because their intuition tells them that the document is likely to exacerbate the day-to-day development of conflict between parents and children and engender a feeling in children that their rights exceed their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention fails to make logical connection between the rights of children as a philosophy and protection of children in need. Significant community concerns have been expressed regarding those articles. If read in isolation, they have the potential to deny parents their rights and responsibilities for protection, development and direction of their children. I believe a mistake has been made in this place tonight and that democracy has been seriously curtailed in gagging once again the right of representatives to debate important issues. We have to do something to straighten this place out because, honest to goodness, we might as well not have a parliament the way it is going. </PARA>

The Bradshaw family has worked this area for many years, pulling sawlogs and transporting them along the Raglan Range Road to mill them in their mills. When this area achieved World Heritage status several years ago the road was closed off. The road had a gate put across it and it was left for walkers and traditional users. Two months ago the state division of parks, wildlife and heritage decided to rehabilitate the road. This is the essence of my concern tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state division of parks, wildlife and heritage took on a value system which I believe has affected us in Tasmania for the past 10 or 15 years. It is of great concern to many of us. Its position is that traditional uses of land and cultural values from our history should be done away with. Areas of land which have been used for logging, hunting and fishing for many years have now been world heritage listed&mdash;and so these traditional things can no longer be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If world heritage status is to mean anything, it should also give recognition to the cultural values of areas, not just their scenic or spiritual value&mdash;or whatever someone else feels is its value. The value system which has enraged many Tasmanians&mdash;probably it is one of the issues on which I was elected to parliament&mdash;has been imposed on the Raglan Range Road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two months ago, under the Tasmanian minister, John Cleary, parks and wildlife, as part of the management plan for the area, decided to rehabilitate the road. The road is made of gravel, with drains on each side, and incorporated along the road are several landings for logging trucks to load up. Over time, they have been taken back by the bush. The road gives a view of the history of the area and of the logging people that worked in a very traditional and hard way over many years. Somebody decided that the road could be seen from the Frenchmans Cap national park walking track and had to be removed; it interfered with somebody's values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning the road to its natural state of prior to the 1930s meant putting some natural cover back on it, at a cost of $20,000. That should not have happened. A heck of a mess has been created along this road, with broken trees and great disruption to the old track. Nothing useful has been achieved. In recent years in Tasmania we have undertaken a forest practices code. I believe that if the people who had imposed this work were subject to that code, they would shortly be going to court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that honourable members would be aware that recent land use arguments between people on the Greens side and those with traditional work values and ways of doing things have taken up a lot of time. Some of the animosity has subsided. I certainly do not wish to revisit the damming of the Franklin or to advocate the pulling of the plug on Lake Pedder. But we must be sensitive to everybody's needs in Tasmania. The west coasters, who have always stood up strongly for their beliefs and traditions, are finding the attitude being applied totally indefensible. The state government spent another $20,000 just down the road at Nelson Falls to create a track into the wilderness area so that somebody could have a natural walking track, when Raglan Range Road could have been used. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An issue arose between the Treasurer and me during question time. I sought the call on the basis of wishing to raise a point of order. In the heat of the moment I sat down without ever stating it. I noticed in checking the greens that you, Mr Speaker, were kind enough to assume that I was clarifying something that happened during the debate. My point of order was under standing order 145&mdash;concerning relevance. I wanted to put that on the record for your sake, Mr Speaker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have spoken on the adjournment last night about some statements that were made in this House yesterday, but I was too late in the door and the House rose at 10.30 p.m. However, things that have happened today have continued the issue&mdash;and I am pleased that I did not speak on the matter then. Events today have underlined what I was going to raise last night. When the 1993-94 budget mark 1 was issued, Treasury analysis showed its very regressive nature. It showed, for example, that certain items were left out of the calculations of how people would be affected. The Treasury analysis did not take into account the impact of the 1 July 1995 increase in sales tax and the effect that would have particularly on low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the analysis did show a number of startling things which have been very disturbing to the opposition, at least to the backbench of the government, and to the Australian community at large. Essentially, it showed that the budget we were given at the beginning of this session was extremely regressive. Low income people would be very adversely affected and single income couples with two children would be worse off than they were 10 years ago. There were certain other assumptions, such as that all pensioners and the unemployed would receive rent assistance&mdash;and on it went. Treasury had used a very flawed model and the analysis that flowed from it was very generous towards the budget. Nevertheless, it still showed that the budget was extremely regressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Budget mark 2 was formulated at an impromptu meeting of caucus on Monday night. My question to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) yesterday was directed towards the outcome and modifications that we have been led to expect will happen; but, even after those changes, the poorer people would be worse off. For example, without taking account of bracket creep, the poorest 20 per cent of single-income families and the poorest 10 per cent of two-income families with children and most independent retiree couples would be worse off. The Treasurer in his answer referred to what was then a not released analysis of the budget, an analysis which he said was going to be released later that day. He made the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . 90 per cent of wage and salary earner household types on average will be shown to be better off.</PARA>
<PARA>But the greens apparently were subsequently amended because they are slightly different from today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> version. The words `full-time' were inserted in front of `wage and salary earners'. It is a fact of the recession we are now enduring that a substantial percentage of people in employment are underemployed. The unemployment figures do not show the effect of underemployment. So the insertion of the words `full-time' in that context is significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went on to talk about `self-employed and farm income household types'. None of these groups that he referred to are the groups that I had questioned him about. So it was the old business: when you are asked a question that you do not like, answer a different question. He raised, in his answer, categories of people different from the ones that I had questioned him about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday afternoon, after question time, the so-called Prismod results were released. They showed that certain things were excluded. This analysis, which at question time the Treasurer was saying showed what a whacko budget it was, contained certain omissions: the income tax broadening issues; increases in the effect of fringe benefits tax and the retrospective taxation of unused annual leave; and the effect of bracket creep. They had not been taken into account, because no projections had been made past 1994-95. The government claims credit for cuts after 1994-95, but it cuts out that area when the inflationary effects of this budget are yet to be felt.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will resume. The exclusion of such basic issues as the effect of inflation, particularly on low income people, is very significant. The issue I raised in question time today was the assumption that all motorists will use the cheaper unleaded petrol as from the time that this budget is passed. The fact is that approximately 60 per cent of Australians drive cars that require leaded petrol&mdash;which is to be significantly more expensive than unleaded petrol. The extra impact is on the very low income people, as the opposition has been saying, who are more likely to drive the older cars requiring the more expensive leaded petrol.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 requires that contributions must be made to a fund which complies with the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 for Superannuation Guarantee Charge purposes.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No. The sum depends on the level of administrative charges, returns on investment and net tax paid, all of which can vary considerably from fund to fund. Nevertheless, funds typically impose an administrative charge of around $1 per week per account to which must be added, in some cases, fund management fees (often of the order of 0.5 per cent of the value of the fund), premiums for death and disability cover, and entry and exit fees.</PARA>
