<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of the undersigned parents and friends of Stockton Child Care Centre draws attention to the House that the Federal Government is seeking to link accreditation to eligibility for Childcare Assistance and in the opinion of your petitioners this link will only lead to higher fees for parents and no guarantee for improvement in quality of care for children.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia opposes the reduction of octane quality of leaded petrol from January 1994, resulting from the Government's `Lead Roundtable' meeting. The petitioners note particularly that this reduction in petrol quality:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)Jeopardises the use of vehicles made prior to 1986 for operation on high octane petrol and could lead to many of those vehicles suffering serious engine damage;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)Will result in worse vehicle operation, higher emissions and greater fuel consumption for up to three million vehicles;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the schedule fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I present the committee's report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's international health programs</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FI4">Mr ALLAN MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report is the result of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into Australia's international health program. The inquiry was originally referred to the committee in the previous parliament and was readopted by this committee with its current membership in June this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Australia's overseas aid program has been the subject of detailed scrutiny in the last 20 years this inquiry is the first parliamentary investigation specifically into Australia's bilateral and multilateral health related aid programs, and into Australia's participation in multilateral health related organisations. It forms part of a wide-ranging revision of the policy and administration of international health programs, and the report's recommendations will, we believe, improve their efficiency and effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has long recognised its obligation and responsibilities to the international community to assist in alleviating the problems of the developing world by providing humanitarian aid and sustainable development assistance. This assistance has predominantly focused on the agricultural sector, with health receiving a low priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992-93 AIDAB and the Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services between them spent approximately $37 million on direct health programs, or around 2.7 per cent of the total aid budget. Additionally, AIDAB spent $10 million on population programs, and $25 million on water supply and sanitation programs. In total, AIDAB and the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services spent $73 million or 5.2 per cent of overseas development aid on health and health related programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This represents an improvement on previous years. For example, in 1991-92 direct health and health related aid constituted only 2.84 per cent of total overseas aid. AIDAB expects the upward trend to continue in 1993-94, especially since budget support to Papua New Guinea is being replaced with program aid and a new four-year $130 million population initiative is under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, many witnesses told the committee that AIDAB does not spend enough of its budget on health or health related projects. For example, the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders told the committee that health care has been the cinderella with AIDAB, and the Public Health Association stated that the health sector programs are incredibly poorly resourced and pathetically poor compared to western European countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AIDAB itself acknowledges that, historically, health aid has taken a low priority in the aid budget. In 1977 it noted that expenditure in the agriculture sector exceeded that in the health sector by a factor of eight, and that only seven per cent of AIDAB sponsored students were in health fields, while those taking agriculture outnumbered students in health by nearly three to one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From an international perspective, the World Bank in its development report for 1993 comments that the share of aid going to health should rise to the equivalent of seven per cent of total development assistance immediately and should then rise substantially over the next five years. Despite the danger of special pleading, the committee believes that there are sufficient grounds to endorse the bank's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to develop coherent health policies and programs, AIDAB requires both generalist in-house health services and access to specialist experts in the wider community. It contracts a wide range of health professionals from academic institutions, non-government organisations and private consultancies to run projects and conduct pre- and post-project evaluations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three themes have emerged in our discussions with witnesses about AIDAB's current program implementation methods and use of contractors. The first is that the current competitive bidding system for AIDAB contracts discourages vital cooperation between the limited number of international health experts in Australia. The second is that AIDAB funding is spread too thinly over many health projects, and the third is that aid projects have an unduly long start-up time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe it is possible to address these three concerns by a modification to the existing system of contracting health experts by focusing on the areas of Australia's greatest health expertise. This would be achieved by determining five or six major health priorities in developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region that could become the focus of AIDAB's health sector aid. The health areas or health subsectors identified should take into account regional priorities and the levels of Australian expertise. Possible subsectors could be malaria, diarrhoeal diseases, rational drug use, micro-nutrition, immunology and HIV/AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends that AIDAB then call for period contracts in each priority health subsector. The successful contracting groups would be drawn upon for all necessary project design and implementation consultancy work in each country where aid projects in that health subsector are undertaken. These evolutionary changes to the current AIDAB procedures should satisfy AIDAB's contractual requirements, encourage cooperation in the health sector and improve the continuity of personnel on AIDAB projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also recommended that AIDAB continue to fund health projects not classed as subsector priorities, although as secondary priorities. While AIDAB is primarily responsible for the administration of the official aid program, the international branch of the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services also delivers some health aid. This department fulfils Australia's international obligations by contributing assessed core funds to the general operation of the World Health Organisation and several specific WHO programs. It also manages Australia's participation in WHO administration and in the activities of its associated agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Health also funds a public health education and research program, known as PHERP. Under PHERP, nine tertiary institutions around Australia are funded to provide public health postgraduate training. Several of the centres offer residential and distance learning public health courses tailored for health professionals and students from developing countries, in particular from the Asia-Pacific region. The centres have developed exchange and partnership arrangements with medical schools in neighbouring countries to encourage institutional strengthening, indigenous research and teaching capabilities. Staff at the centres are also involved in conducting public health related research and consultancies, often in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international activities of these centres play an important role in strengthening the health services of developing countries, many of which receive other forms of Australian health aid. Such training reduces the reliance of developing countries on aid donors and overseas expertise to develop primary health programs. These activities also provide a commercial return for Australia by providing a cash inflow to these institutions and in the long run by encouraging trainees to continue to use Australian expertise and develop links with our professionals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To provide these kinds of international health facilities, Australian institutions need to maintain their own staff and research programs, and this requires a long-term funding commitment by the government. We believe the current review of PHERP provides a good opportunity for the department to demonstrate its commitment. We recommend that the international PHERP funding be guaranteed for a period of at least six years, and then on a triennial basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aspect of Australian aid in respect of political, strategic and economic returns is an important part of our inquiry. AIDAB estimates that 87 per cent of the value of its aid program is made up of goods and services sourced from Australia. This is much less in the health sector. While the health sector does not lend itself readily to commercial exploitation because of the nature of primary health care, it does in fact offer some potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case, it relates to multilateral and health related organisations and the various multilateral development banks. These organisations tender international consultancies and equipment worth many hundreds of millions of dollars each year. In this context, we were told by UNICEF that our participation in these programs is disappointingly low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that in recent years the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Austrade and AIDAB have been endeavouring to provide Australian companies with advice on multilateral contracts. It is important that integration of the commercially oriented activities of the organisations continue to develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One important principle of aid funding is that it is most effective when funded on a secure, long-term basis. Long-term expenditure commitments provide stability, which assists developing countries to strengthen their own support structures and assists Australian individuals and institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is concerned about the government decision in October 1993 to freeze expenditure of all non-committed  funds in the population program pending an independent inquiry into the relationship between rapid population growth and economic development. Such short-term action destroys Australia's reputation for providing justified and well planned aid programs and, in this case, flies in the face of internationally recognised policy directions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That decision also creates a potential precedent for other aid programs which could also be disrupted at short notice. These views were reinforced by the Chairman of the World Bank, who told us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family planning is a key, and cost-effective, component of maternal and child health and its vigorous promotion is justified on that ground alone. Smaller and better spaced families are much more healthy . . . in addition, the eradication of illegal abortion would reduce the number of maternal deaths per year by about 30 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the subcommittee of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs which examined Australia's international health programs, I am pleased to comment on its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's international health programs</EMPHASIS>. As the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), mentioned, it was my first inquiry and I certainly found it most interesting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the witnesses for their evidence and also for their very detailed submissions. As the inquiry proceeded I was left in no doubt that Australia has experts who are able to provide world-class health programs to countries less fortunate than ours. Many witnesses left me with the impression that they certainly cared a great deal about what they were doing. However, AIDAB was strongly criticised by many witnesses. It could be argued that the report should have been written in stronger language, but the committee sought to be constructive. The recommendations, if implemented, should overcome many of the problems that we have found to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993-94, AIDAB will spend $1,402 million on aid to other countries, and $90 million of that will be spent on health projects. I mention that to highlight the real need to do things in a coordinated way and to get our best value for the dollar. The evidence to date suggests that we have not been well coordinated, and we have also neglected to follow aid opportunities with trade in the way many other countries do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard, for instance, from Professor Eastman, Chairman of the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders at Westmead Hospital. He put it in perspective when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps there needs to be an independent advisory committee to AIDAB and the health department that is not set up by those bureaucracies, but constituted in some other way&mdash;by Parliament or in some other manner&mdash;that can provide independent advice upon what we as a country have got to offer. We have got to respond to the needs of developing countries in our region. I am the first to argue that we must respond, and it must be humanitarian based. But we have got to be more pragmatic. There are enormous commercial opportunities, and we are just ignoring them. I do not think you should divorce aid and trade. I think they are linked. In the real world, we have not only to supply humanitarian assistance to developing countries in our region, but we have to be a lot smarter in terms of how this country can capitalise on some of those advantages. We have got to be much more pragmatic.</PARA>
<PARA>He is quite emphatic in his criticisms of the advice that committees comprised of only bureaucrats give. There must be greater cooperation between AIDAB and the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services. AIDAB was concerned that the use of too many advisory groups would lead `to an amazing load of clutter at the end of the day', but the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services saw the benefits of having input from outside experts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many important recommendations as a result of the inquiry, but I believe those recommending that additional experts should be called in where necessary to provide advice are crucial, because, as I mentioned earlier, there is a huge budget involved with our overseas health projects. We must get the best value for our dollar. The advice from the witnesses was that there was no real collection of the experience these projects were gathering to hand on to others&mdash;what was learnt in one country was not being used in another. They felt that we tended to completely ignore the advantage to our own country of research data which could be gathered from the health projects in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Australia, for instance, we have the example of the craniofacial unit which uses the whole of South-East Asia as a catchment area. While providing aid and assistance to people from those countries, it gathers research that will be put to the best benefit for our road accident victims and those people who are now bashed on the streets. Good can come out of all this; we just have to be smarter. As many a witness said, we have to get our act together and use the best possible people to give advice so that our projects are well coordinated. The recommendations should solve these problems, and I hope the government implements them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee undertook this inquiry to determine whether access and equity strategy is meeting the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, or whether Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are still being denied access and equity in the range of government services available to all Australians. The title of the report&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access and equity&mdash;rhetoric or reality?</EMPHASIS>&mdash;sums up this choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In undertaking this inquiry into the implementation of the Commonwealth's access and equity strategy, the committee examined the comprehensiveness of the strategy, the extent to which it had been implemented and the outcomes that had been achieved for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1992 the Office of Multicultural Affairs undertook an evaluation of the access and equity strategy. In general, it was found that the barriers to access and equity were more marked and more resistant to erosion for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders than for any other group of people. The inquiry confirmed these findings through discussions with a wide range of community groups. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rhetoric or reality?</EMPHASIS> points out that there is still a large proportion of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who are not getting appropriate access to, and equity in, the range of government services available to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government services should be available to all Australians who are entitled to them, regardless of race, religion, language or culture. This is one of the main principles of the Commonwealth's access and equity strategy. Access and equity policy recognises that while some services may be universally applicable, they may not be equally accessible if they are uniformly designed and delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This lack of access to mainstream programs and services is a problem that particularly affects Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. One of the major barriers that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people face in gaining access to a range of government services is that services do not cater for the needs and circumstances of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The committee is concerned that the access and equity strategy has been in existence since 1985, and has included Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as target groups since 1989, yet has still to achieve any significant outcomes for Australia's most disadvantaged and dispossessed groups of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes it is vital that the views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at the grassroots level are heard and responded to. The committee travelled across Australia, talking to a wide range of community organisations and regional councils, to hear of the problems their members face and to identify where improvements have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a consistent message delivered to the committee wherever we went that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should determine the priorities and strategies for programs aimed at tackling the causes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The discussions the committee held confirmed that there are still considerable barriers for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in gaining full access and equity in the range of government services available. These barriers include racism, language, culture, inappropriately designed and delivered services, and a lack of services in many areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be recognised that there are still a large number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who speak their own language or languages but who may have difficulty in speaking English. Government departments need to take these barriers into account when designing and delivering services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain groups of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people also face additional disadvantages. These groups include women, older people, people with disabilities and youth. The committee heard much evidence that these groups of people are extremely disadvantaged with respect to government services. They present real challenges for service deliverers to adequately address their special needs and circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ignorance among the wider community of the diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and traditions is still a major barrier facing these people. This ignorance is reflected in the political and government structures for service provision. The committee has placed considerable emphasis on the development of cross-cultural awareness courses within all departments and agencies to give an understanding of the different needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coordination of programs and services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is still very poor and it is contributing to the continuing disadvantage and inequities. A much greater effort is needed from all levels of government to improve coordination of services, especially in the light of the heads of government commitment in December 1992 to improve outcomes in the delivery of programs and services for indigenous people. Government agencies at all levels must also ensure that their programs and services are designed to take into account the different needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State, territory and local governments play an important role in the delivery of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In undertaking this inquiry the committee heard a great deal of evidence that there are a number of areas being funded by the Commonwealth, and in particular some projects being funded by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, that are essentially state, territory and local government responsibilities. These include areas of health, housing and infrastructure. State governments have access and equity responsibilities where they deliver Commonwealth funded programs. Awareness of their responsibilities varied markedly between states and territories. This is an area that needs corrective action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned before, the access and equity strategy is yet to have a significant impact on Aboriginal and Islander people. The committee is critical of the way in which the Office of Multicultural Affairs has handled the access and equity strategy in respect of Aboriginal and Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a strategy which is meant to identify and eliminate barriers facing minority groups, the Office of Multicultural Affairs has allowed migrant issues to swamp Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues. The committee found the Office of Multicultural Affairs to be unsuitable as the coordinating agency responsible for Aboriginal and Islander aspects of the strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the committee has recommended that the coordination of access and equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people be separated from the Office of Multicultural Affairs and be established as a separate unit, with appropriate resources, under the responsibility of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner would provide a more thorough and sensitive oversight of the access and equity strategy as it applies to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. While implementation of the strategy across government agencies has been patchy, one department has stood out as a true success story. The Department of Social Security has made considerable advances in access and equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The DSS has introduced a number of important measures to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people receive their correct entitlements. It was almost universally accepted by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities across Australia that there is a strong commitment by DSS to achieve access and equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range of programs established by DSS to improve access and equity to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples include the following: the support network for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interpreter service; remote visiting teams; and the community agent's program. I would urge other departments at all levels to take special note of these programs, and their effectiveness, and consider them when targeting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their own programs and services. This inquiry confirmed the finding of the evaluation of the access and equity strategy undertaken by the Office of Multicultural Affairs, that policy oriented departments such as Finance, Treasury, and Prime Minister and Cabinet are still to find meaningful applications for the access and equity strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the future of access and equity. In the formulation of policies and programs and in the delivery of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, departments and agencies need to take into account the special needs and circumstances of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The committee was seriously concerned about the inadequate provision of essential services such as water, electricity and sewerage to many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. In many instances, funding for Aboriginal affairs is being used to provide services that should have been provided by mainstream agencies instead of being used to address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage and to promote self-management. The committee is also determined to end the continuing myth concerning the levels of expenditure by the Commonwealth and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs and the amount of responsibility that ATSIC has in tackling areas of need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In chapter 4 on page 65 of the report, there are graphs which show that ATSIC is allocated only 0.6 of 1 per cent of the federal budget to fund its programs. This is only half the total Commonwealth outlays on specific Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs. Several other departments administer targeted programs. The total expenditure by the Commonwealth on the target of Aboriginal programs was $1.3 billion in 1992-93 or 1.18 per cent of the total budget. Yet Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people total 1.6 per cent of the Australian population. Many other government departments have mainstream responsibilities to provide services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but, as this report shows, there is a very patchy performance by these departments. Too often the committee heard government departments and Aboriginal people state that ATSIC was totally responsible for service delivery when it is clearly not funded to achieve this aim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to sincerely thank all of the people involved in the preparation of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rhetoric or reality?</EMPHASIS>; the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who gave their time to make submissions and to talk to the committee; and the members of the committee for their valuable input of ideas. We had a number of new members of this parliament on the committee and they worked very hard to bring this report to a conclusion. I also wish to thank the staff of the committee, Allan Kelly, Craig Dukes, Penne Humphries and Peter Ratas for their enormous effort in completing this report. The recommendations contained in this report will provide a framework for much better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the previous speaker, the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who is the chairman of the committee, I pay tribute to the staff members and also to the members of the committee who were assiduous in their enthusiasm. If one is going to single out any group of people for praise in the conduct of the inquiry, it has to be those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who appeared before the committee and provided evidence and insights. We could not have functioned, nor reached a result, nor arrived at any recommendations, without their enthusiastic cooperation. Without them, there would have been no report. The recommendations are very important and very significant. I would like to emphasise some of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One that most Australians would not be aware of, of course, is the need for interpreters. While we have a specific reference to the federal court system, it applies right throughout the whole range of government activities. Most non-Aboriginal or non-Torres Strait Islander Australians would not be aware that, for many of the people we were talking with, English was a second language. We have a concentration on migrants from non-English speaking countries for this sort of assistance in teaching English as a foreign language and also the interpreter service. It really is a most important factor. If we cannot communicate, if we cannot understand, if we cannot be understood, it means that our access and our equity are very limited indeed. I see this as perhaps the most important single recommendation. People have to be understood; there has to be communication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This also applies to the mass mail-outs, to individuals in communities, of correspondence from the Department of Social Security to remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities where we found evidence that, because of the method of distribution and, again, the language situation and perhaps the scarcity of mail deliveries, where a deadline was set, it was impossible within the time constraints for the appropriate forms to be completed and for the recipients to get the services they were entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also particularly concerned that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should work in hospitals to provide that human interface between the institution and people who may be regarded as perhaps a little unsophisticated in the ways of a city environment. Of course, for them to go into the standard, major hospital is a very traumatic experience indeed. It is one that tends to stop Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people seeking the medical care that they need and are entitled to. Other members of the committee will speak about other things, but I want to stress the need to have Aboriginal liaison people in a whole range of government activities but particularly in the area of health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have another concern that goes right across the community for me; it is not just something related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I am referring to care of the aged. Again, we find that aged care facilities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are virtually nonexistent. I will not go through the particular circumstances of one case in my electorate which the committee knows of in great detail, involving the Booroongen Djugun corporation, which is seeking to provide aged care in Kempsey. This is just symptomatic of another major area where access and equity virtually do not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community of Australia is the most disadvantaged community we have, with the possible&mdash;no, certain&mdash;exception of the descendants of the South Sea Islanders who need some assistance as well. I am delighted to see the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) present in the House. I would have been very surprised&mdash;amazed, in fact&mdash;if he had not been not here because he too is assiduous in performing his duties. If the minister and the government can pick up most, if not all, of these recommendations, access and equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians will be far more accessible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse the comments of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I support the report and acknowledge the work of my colleagues on the committee and particularly that of the secretariat, who have worked very hard to get this publication into the parliament on our behalf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a privilege, as the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) said, to meet with so many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in diverse communities across this country. In the short time that I have, I will confine my comments to women's issues. I quote from a quote of Maureen Kirk's from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal communities are built on a pyramid shape. At the base of the pyramid are the women. These women are the carers, the givers, the mothers and the wives. They support the whole community. If these women don't stay healthy, the community support system breaks down. If women get sick or die, the whole family structure collapses.</PARA>
<PARA>It is certainly true that the women that we met right across this country have a great commitment to attempting to deal with the health issues that are very important to the community. One of the issues in terms of access and equity was the great difficulties of providing culturally appropriate services for indigenous women in this country, particularly culturally appropriate birthing facilities. It is not widely understood and appreciated that where indigenous women give birth outside their own country this is a major impediment to the integration of that birth into the community. The same sort of thing can be said on providing appropriate breast and cervical cancer screening programs. We are not doing nearly enough in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of need for education of mainstream services. In all health services I believe we have got to look at integrating into mainstream services the specific services that have been developed by and with and for indigenous people. As well as providing effective liaison and policy makers within our mainstream services, there has got to be more effective integration, and we have suggested in the report contracting-out to specific service deliverers, because there is no doubt that a continuing theme throughout the inquiry was the confidence that indigenous people have in appropriate specifically designed services and the lack of confidence to approach mainstream services, where they often find implicit and explicit racism. We have made a recommendation 19 that I want to endorse in particular. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In implementing the access and equity strategy, departments and agencies pay particular attention to the roles and needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, including their effective representation on policy making and consultative bodies.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that one of the great experiences for me on this inquiry was to meet so many beautiful, intelligent, committed black women across this country who are shouldering a huge burden and are leading the way in provision of effective services. What we have to remember is that every day black women in this country confront racism and sexism, and I think that this is a burden that is not understood by the European community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to two cultural events that I have participated in. The first is the final performance of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bran Nue Dae</EMPHASIS> which took place in Rockhampton recently after a seven-month run. This was a celebration in song and dance of the real life experience of indigenous people in this country. It was wonderful to see both European and indigenous people enjoying that performance, and I was pleased to welcome into my family Josie Lawford, who is the partner of a cousin of mine, Richard Mellick, and their son Jaden. Family is important to indigenous people, and Josie is now part of my family. I want to refer also to a new play by Louis Nowra called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Radiance</EMPHASIS>, which also looks at the life experiences of indigenous women. It confronts the issues that I have referred to. This report once again shows that we have much to do if we are going to provide social justice for indigenous people. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the access and equity strategy rhetoric or reality? This report confirms that the access and equity strategy, with the possible exception of its implementation by the Department of Social Security, is almost totally a failure. It is rhetoric and definitely not reality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No other community in this country is as grossly disadvantaged as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. The report tabled today strengthens that observation. It emphasises that there is much to be done to ensure that indigenous Australians have full access and equity to government services. It expresses a wide range of concerns about the barriers to access and equity, including racism, language, culture, inappropriately designed and delivered services and an almost total lack of services in many areas. However, given the very limited time available to me, I want to focus my comments on a couple of the recommendations that I support regarding young people, the Office of Multicultural Affairs and health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 50 per cent of the indigenous population is under 20 years of age and over 70 per cent is under the age of 25. In the committee's inquiry it was made quite clear to me that we have a problem of massive proportions that is not being addressed adequately by the Labor government's access and equity strategy. The problems of drug and alcohol abuse, mental health problems and juvenile crime that are so prevalent amongst young Australians in these times of high unemployment are magnified in the indigenous communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Homelessness, with its associated difficulties of crime and drug and alcohol abuse, is a major problem among indigenous youth, particularly for those living in urban areas. The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service told the committee that eight out of 10 homeless indigenous young people would end up dead in youth training centres or in prison. Aboriginal juveniles are over-represented in the prison and juvenile detention systems compared to other community groups, a fact already highlighted by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully support the recommendation of the committee that a youth task force be established as quickly as possible to make a detailed examination of the best ways to develop strategies to tackle these problems. One of the reasons why the successful outcomes of the access and equity strategy have not been achieved in the indigenous population is the failure by the Office of Multicultural Affairs to effectively coordinate the strategy and monitor government departments and agencies in relation to access and equity for indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, the Office of Multicultural Affairs has not given any priority at all to indigenous affairs and has demonstrated a lack of expertise and commitment in dealing with access and equity issues in this area. The OMA is not the right agency to be dealing with access and equity issues for the indigenous communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the committee's recommendation that the most suitable agency to take over its function is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner is already focused on the way government agencies tackle the issues of disadvantage to indigenous Australians. The commissioner will be well placed to report on the adequacy of service delivery to individuals in the indigenous population with a greater level of expertise and commitment than is evident in the OMA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the greatest and most damaging aspect of lack of equity and access for the indigenous population is in the area of health service delivery. Our inquiry has shown that because mainstream health services do not provide equitable access or reasonable treatment to indigenous people, the burden of health care delivery has fallen increasingly on the community-based health care agencies which do not have the resources to cope adequately with a job they were not designed to do. The evidence that came out of the inquiry highlights the need for much greater cooperation between the mainstream health services and ATSIC organisations, as well as other government service providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that poor health in the indigenous community is the result of extreme deprivation, including poor housing, lack of essential services such as water, sewerage and electricity, and poor diet. Not only should there be greater input by local communities into the management and delivery of health services, as this report recommends, but there should also be a much greater level of consultation and cooperation with all government departments if the goals of the access and equity strategy are to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be a greater appreciation of the special needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the problems they face in gaining equal access to services. This understanding and acknowledgment has to come from the top and be reflected in all levels of policy and decision making in mainstream government departments. </PARA>

I compliment the chairman, the honourable member for Morton (Mr Gibson), the deputy chairman, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), and all members of the committee for the way in which they undertook the inquiry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment also people like Allan Kelly, Craig Dukes, Penne Humphries and Peter Ratas, people who gave more than they were paid to give in connection with acting as the committee secretariat for the inquiry. We appreciate the dedicated way in which they applied themselves because they also understood the importance of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry into whether Aboriginal people have the same access to, and equity in, government programs and services as other Australians, had to be undertaken. The fact that the report has 37 recommendations indicates clearly that access and equity for Aboriginal Australians have been very deficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might well ask, particularly those people in Australia who still unfortunately believe that there may be an imbalance in the services, facilities and funding provided for Aboriginal Australians relative to other Australians, why, in one of the most affluent countries in the world, do we have Aboriginal Australians who are amongst the most disadvantaged and deprived people anywhere in the world, including some of the worst Third World countries? In a country like Australia, that has comprehensive social, health, education, housing and unemployment programs, why is it that a group of Australians suffer Third World conditions? The early mortality rate of Aboriginal Australians is high, their health is seriously deficient, their educational standards are low, and their housing is often deplorable. That certainly does not indicate to me equal access and equitable treatment for all Australians. That is why the inquiry was undertaken and why we have made those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the government is going to respond to the recommendations. As far as education is concerned, I think, although I could be wrong, that Charlie Perkins was the first Australian Aboriginal graduate. Next year the first Australian Aboriginal graduate in medicine will start to practise. That is next year&mdash;200 years after the first European settlement in Australia. If Charlie Perkins was the first, since then there has been a growing number of Aboriginal people undertaking specialist professional training, including law and medicine&mdash;another 15 Aboriginals are currently in medical training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), the honourable member for Cowper, and the committee chairman, the honourable member for Moreton, referred to the fact that we were proud to meet and hear the Aboriginal people. They are proud, dignified, articulate and determined people, who know the sorts of directions that need to be taken. Their advice to us was of great value, and that is encompassed now in the committee report. </PARA>

Time and time again, the evidence showed the need for that to continue and for the maximum amount of cooperation to occur. Far too much best use of resources is currently lost in this process. As is said in the recommendation, what is needed is maximum coordination in the delivery of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as already agreed to at the December 1992 meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. I hope that that process can be instigated posthaste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) mentioned Aboriginal women.

Once again, cooperation between state and federal areas is important. I am involved in some of those initiatives in my electorate. Enterprise development is one of the great hopes for the future. Many of the communities that this committee spoke to during the last few months are positive examples and are great models for the future. </PARA>

It is something which many people have tried to do something about over many years. There are some positive solutions out there. The work that we have done in these last few months, combined with the work of the agencies and the other tools available to us, will help us to get on top of this huge problem.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Driving the road dollar further: inquiry into the efficiency of road construction and maintenance</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Building and maintaining roads is a big business. In Australia each year almost $6,000 million is spent on road construction and maintenance by the three levels of government: federal, state and local. Despite the difficulty in securing hard information on potential construction and maintenance savings to be made, I firmly believe that there are undoubtedly substantial benefits to be gained from improving the efficiency of road construction and maintenance practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me point to some examples. The New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority suggests that the implementation of maintenance management systems, MMS, could save up to $50 million per year. John Holland Constructions says that savings of up to 25 per cent are available in road rehabilitation if appropriate new technology is used. Vicroads states that administrative cost savings of up to 50 per cent are available if local councils share resources. The Department of Transport and Communications states that increasing project size can result in efficiency gains of up to 50 per cent. The Tasmanian government says that a recycling/cement stabilisation process can result in efficiencies of up to 75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this inquiry it was the committee's objective to identify as many savings as possible, so ensuring that the taxpayers' road dollar is driven as far as possible. The lack of hard evidence hindered the committee's investigations. The committee was supplied with mountains of information, but much of it was too general or could not be substantiated. For example, when pressed on the benefits available from the implementation of pavement and maintenance management systems most state road authorities could only offer vague estimates. In addition, the Department of Transport and Communications was unable to identify or quantify expected efficiency gains in roadworks from an administrative reorganisation designed to improve the project approval process. In short, never has so much public money been spent by so many people over so many years with so little information collected and so few analyses prepared on how well the money has been used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the committee has noticed an improvement in the collection of road management data. The federal government has probably done more than most in this area by requiring pavement management system, PMS, data collection on national highway projects and the adoption of quality assurance practices. Several of the committee's recommendations aimed to increase the information available to policy makers when they are making road planning decisions. The evidence presented to the committee indicated that there is a growing concern with the effectiveness of road planning decisions, as much as with the efficiency of the construction and maintenance task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This concern reflects a growing realisation of the futility of past political debates that have centred on the level of road funding rather than on how well road funds are spent. Increasingly, measures are being taken to ensure that the right road is built in the right location, for the right reasons and in the most efficient manner. To successfully achieve this, road programs need to have clear objectives, linked to strategies designed to achieve those objectives and an effective means of measuring progress towards those objectives. Consequently, the committee considers that a more strategic outlook needs to be adopted for the entire road network by each level of government. Road network managers need to have a sound means of establishing priorities for road works to ensure that road funding is being spent as effectively and efficiently as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the many construction and maintenance issues put forward for consideration, several issues stood out as being critical. These are the uncertainty or the stop-go nature of road funding; the poor timing of the availability of road funds; the untying of federal road funding; and the increasing importance of the maintenance of the road network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is suggested that the unpredictability of road funding levels was the cause of significant inefficiencies, as it robbed road authorities of the opportunity to plan with certainty for long-term works. In his proposal for the future administration of a national highway system, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) addresses this problem by proposing a guaranteed three-year funding program. The committee supports this proposal and recommends that the federal government maintain a three-year funding program. The committee believes that the earlier introduction of the federal budget will also improve the ability of road authorities to plan long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The untying of road funding to state governments and local councils by the Commonwealth government will add to the unpredictability of road funding levels, and already there is evidence that road funds have been syphoned off for other uses. For example, the New South Wales government has decided to transfer some $50 million of untied road grants to the state's rail network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognises the outcomes of the 1991 Special Premiers Conference and accepts the rights of governments to establish their own financial priorities. However, given the size of federal road grants and the importance of the road network to Australia's economic performance, the committee has recommended that future Commonwealth road funding to state governments and local councils be earmarked, and that those bodies be required to verify that the funds have, in fact, been spent on roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became evident during the inquiry that the maintenance of the road network will become the major task for managers. The continual development of pavement and maintenance systems will improve the effectiveness of maintenance programs. Recognising the importance of this development, the committee has made recommendations which support the implementation of pavement and maintenance management systems for road programs. The adoption of new road technology and road research is an area which needs improvement. Given that almost $6,000 million is spent on roads each year in this country, that lack of investment in research by the private sector is, indeed, disappointing. The committee's recommendations in this area are aimed at improving the take-up rate of new technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to emphasise to the House that the inquiry was not limited to the national highway system. There are identifiable benefits in examining the entire road network. Expenditure on the national highway system is a minor proportion of total road funding. The majority of road expenditure is directed to state and local roads. In the course of the inquiry, the committee was, therefore, able to take a national perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By looking at the entire road network, it became evident that state and local administrations have similar problems to those found to be prevalent in the administration of the national highway system. The effectiveness of the committee's recommendations will be diminished if all areas of the road network do not improve. In other words, if it is left simply to the Commonwealth to take action in this area of expenditure and responsibility, then this nation is not going to be able to get the benefits that are due to it from state road authorities and state road expenditure, particularly in the case of local government. Considering that state governments and councils spend the majority of road funds, it is especially important that they implement the committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An improvement in the efficiency of road authorities and the construction and maintenance of roads has been evidenced since the inquiry began. The committee expects that the report and its recommendations will enable road network managers to consolidate the improvements that they have already made. Importantly, the report will enable continual future improvement in road construction and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I began by saying that the committee's concern was to drive the taxpayers' road dollar further. I believe that the committee's recommendations will improve the value received for the road dollar and provide the basis for continual improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of road construction and maintenance. Overall, there is little doubt that the existing inefficiencies in road construction and maintenance activities across all levels of government are robbing this nation of up to almost $1 billion worth of road works each year. In other words, almost $1 billion worth of additional roadworks could be performed in this country without the expenditure of one additional dollar. The responsibility to embrace those improvements rests upon federal, state and local governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I wish to thank my committee colleagues of the 36th and 37th parliaments for their interest and assistance during the inquiry and in completing the report. I also thank the committee's advisers, Mr Nelson Waslin and Andy Hrast. Christopher Paterson, who was acting secretary of the committee for most of 1992, made a valuable contribution. I would also like to thank the committee secretariat for their valuable assistance during the inquiry and in completing the report. I commend the report to the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would certainly like to support the comments made by the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I take this opportunity to congratulate him on the work that he has done on this committee in guiding it to a reasonably successful conclusion. I also support his comments regarding the tremendous efforts put in by the support staff of this committee. I am sure that all previous and present members of the committee would agree with that sentiment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is a very useful addition to the ongoing debate about roads. Everyone is aware of the importance of roads, but in this parliament almost no other subject is discussed which has as many myths about it and as much misunderstanding of the real problem involved. Few people are aware of the virtually total anarchy that we have in the whole area of the construction and funding of roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the items in the report really brings home the nature of the problem in Australia, a problem which most people are unaware of. It is this: we have one of the largest countries in the world, but with the least number of people in it. Therefore, costs for roads are always going to be a problem for us. But the extent of that problem is quite amazing, if we look at the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a total in the report which shows that the Federal Republic of Germany has 19 kilometres of road per 1,000 passenger cars. Great Britain has 22 kilometres, and even the United States has only 49 kilometres. But Australia has 104 kilometres of road per 1,000 cars, so we have got very few vehicles but they are using an enormously extensive road system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The equation looks even worse&mdash;and I know I am digressing slightly, but I wish to emphasise the nature of our transport problem&mdash;when we start to look at rail figures. The figures I have from the Bureau of Transport Economics are in fact the international comparisons, the last available figures being for 1983. Of course, we all know that there have been a lot of closures since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at those figures, we see that Japan has one kilometre of railway per 10,000 head of population. The United Kingdom has three kilometres; France has six; and the United States has 11. Australia has 29 kilometres of railway per 10,000 head of population. So you can see the nature of the problem that we have got, and this report goes some way towards focusing on these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the committee considered that the real issues of the level of road funding and road pricing policies were outside its terms of reference. The committee's initial purpose was, as the chairman has indicated, to ensure that the right roads are constructed in the right way, in the right place, and in the most efficient manner. It soon became obvious that this is the one thing that the Australian road construction system cannot do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There simply are no real program objectives, no real performance indicators, and no criteria for consistency between national, state and local governments in the prioritising of new projects or even of maintenance works. We saw, in the 1960s and 1970s, tremendous overbuilding of new roads by local government, which completely ignored the future maintenance problems that we now see are starting to emerge. In the last decade, the real problem of the reconstruction of existing roads has arisen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not got time to go into the matter fully but, contrary to the assertions of many in this House, the trucking industry has been getting a massive subsidy, and in this manner: we are now having to build reinforced concrete roads that are 450 millimetres thick, at a cost of $6 million per kilometre. That figure does not even include any of the external costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, the trucking industry has been fed heroin in the form of massive subsidies in recent years. It is really quite mischief-making of people to come along here and claim that they are massively overtaxed, and pretend that the community is only spending $6 billion per annum on roads, when in fact the true costs of our road building program are more like three times that figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time left to me, I will focus on the toll road submissions that we received, which showed a pretty frightening picture. The private toll road system as it has started to develop in Australia is really one of the more insidious things that have happened in road planning. Instead of moving to rational road pricing policies, and instead of moving to a user-pays system, we have quite the opposite case. In the Sydney metropolitan area, we have seen that the toll road proposals are now basically to make money. They have got nothing to do with transport policy and nothing to do with planning, and they are causing massive distortions in our transport system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report, which traversed 18 months since the inquiry was originally advertised, comes on the heels of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>, a highly credible document, and will be followed by an inquiry into transport and communications for the Olympic Games. It is a committee with exciting times ahead of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The focused completion of such a diverse range of studies would not be possible without quality and empathetic leadership, and I compliment the honourable member for Shortland not only for his singular personal contribution but also for the even-handedness of his approach to his colleagues. The committee comprised members from three parties and an Independent&mdash;left and right leanings&mdash;and yet few matters, other than those required by the formalities of the committee, went to a vote. The bipartisan spirit of getting things right for Australia, and I do not mean that gratuitously, created an atmosphere of consensus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A former colleague of mine, who held a comparatively small electorate in geographic terms, undertook in the run-up to a state election a survey, through a highly professional consultancy, on issues which most worried his constituents. In a reasonably affluent long-established provincial city, he anticipated that there would be all sorts of reactions. To his surprise, the issue uppermost in the collective conscience of his electorate was roads&mdash;and this is a city long-established and with few civic infrastructure problems. This illustrates the point that Australians&mdash;who, by their very circumstances, have to be mobile&mdash;are conscious of the need for efficient and safe arteries of communication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in this country 790,000 kilometres of roads, varying in range from highly developed expressways in the capital cities to little more than tracks through desert and scrub. As the honourable member for North Sydney said, we have 104 kilometres per 1,000 vehicles in Australia, compared with 49 kilometres in the US, 22 in the UK and 19 in Germany. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of matters come through very clearly in this report. There is an absence of competent and comparable data in the national road construction industry. The committee found that there was a lack of information upon which an assessment could be made on the efficiency of road construction and maintenance in our country. Until this is done, one of the major expenditure items of every annual budget remains under a cloud. We spend in Australia $6 billion annually on roads. Imagine what a saving of 10 per cent would mean to the annual budget. Imagine an extra 10 per cent being available for additional roadworks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most disappointing features was, in many cases, the poor quality of information which might, in other circumstances, have provided a comprehensive national outline of the road network. It is true that state road authorities have objectives and strategic plans but there is a vast variation in the quality of these plans. Obviously, there needs to be a set of unambiguous objectives for the entire national road network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> From this flows the need for performance indicators to evaluate road programs. Local government was shown to be the least responsive area in this field of demonstrable strategic planning, though doubtless many councils do plan strategically. I suspect others fly by the seat of their pants simply because the funds are not available or do not match incessant demand. In all this, we must not lose sight of the fact that local authorities are responsible for 78 per cent of all road kilometres in Australia. Despite this, we have recommended that strategic plans by councils be a condition of future road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I differed from my colleagues in the application of this requirement, believing that the supervising authority should be the state government and not the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services. This would add yet another layer of bureaucracy to the already hard-pressed councils grappling with an ever increasing burden of surveys and reporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly too, the problem does not just lie with councils. Government has to share the blame. We cannot have proper strategic planning without the knowledge of our resources. Therefore, we have a three-year planning regime so that state and local authorities can be constantly looking ahead. I strongly support this. From that, it follows that councils and state governments must verify annually that funds have been spent on roadworks and, as the honourable member for Shortland said, this is not always the case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I present the Constitution Alteration (Alterations of the Constitution on the Initiative of the Electors) Bill 1993. The bill is essentially a proposal to enable the Australian people to determine whether they should have a direct say in setting the agenda for constitutional reform. If so, the bill sets out a process by which that would occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, the people already have the legal right to determine whether change to the constitution occurs but, unfortunately, the right to initiate change is a monopoly of governments. This monopoly, together with the public's quite justified suspicion of the self-serving nature of institutions, is one of the reasons for the very limited success in attempts at constitutional reform since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the bill requires a referendum to come into effect, there are therefore three questions before the House. Firstly, should the government deny the public the right to decide whether the public wants to take part directly in agenda setting for constitutional reform? Secondly, is there public benefit in breaking the government monopoly on initiating referenda? Thirdly, does this bill represent an appropriate mechanism?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I understand the reasons why some would oppose the public's right to initiate constitutional changes and why there would be disagreement about the details of the process, I cannot accept the denial of the public's right to decide the question. That view is incompatible with belief in democracy. In the end it is a denial of the people's right to vote. It is a denial of the fundamental basis of Australian democracy, which is that the people are sovereign. Our constitution confers that right, unlike the Westminster system in the United Kingdom, where the parliament is sovereign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is really about decentralisation of power from executive government to the people. In the three years since this bill last came before this House, there have been a number of movements both in Australia and internationally that underline why it should receive serious consideration. Across the world there have been expressions of strong dissatisfaction with governments, leading to massive change not only in the former communist bloc but generally in Western Europe, Asia, Africa, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, and even here in Australia disillusionment has never been greater. Everywhere people have wanted to push the bounds of democracy beyond the limited forms that their governments permit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, the passion of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to change the head of state has opened the door for major constitutional reform for the first time since Federation, and the public should have a real role in setting the agenda. Most attempts in the last 90 years have been driven by narrow interests without public support; hence the high failure rate. The head of state debate has released the demand for change pent up over the last 15 years resulting from the international economic and social changes and the inexorable forces of globalisation. All this is increasingly exposing the defects of Australia's political administrative structure and the obsolescence of parts of our constitution  cobbled together by the state politicians of the 1890s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years New South Wales has seen the first constitutional reform in over a century. Concepts of decentralising power through such mechanisms as the citizen initiative referendum are being seriously discussed in New South Wales, the ACT and Tasmania, and even by some major political parties around Australia. The motivation for this is overwhelming because it is being recognised that people want decentralisation of power; they want a say in decisions that affect them. Rightly or wrongly, the fact that I and the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) were elected to this House, in spite of the enormous difficulties for an individual, is evidence of this. The empowering of people by enabling them to vote directly at some 37 referenda in four years was a major reason for my obtaining an unprecedented 90 per cent of the vote in a mayoral election in North Sydney in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry to say that the only group out of step with this universal trend seems to be the Australian Labor Party. Even this is only a relatively recent regression, as the initiative referendum was part of the party's platform from its inception until 1963. That was about the period when the `true believers' began to become largely stepping-stones for the elitists, reinforced by the massive growth in bureaucracy and academia in the postwar period. Underlying the opposition to extending democratic rights to public participation in the political agenda is elitism and a basic distrust in democracy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It comes as no surprise, of course, to all of my colleagues in this place that I am once again speaking about the need for improvements to the Pacific Highway. It is an issue that I commenced in late 1984 before I was first elected to the House of Representatives and I have, frankly, never let up on my campaign for a new Pacific Highway. I believe that the economic benefits which will accrue, not just to the north coast of New South Wales and south-east Queensland but to the whole of Australia, justify the creation of a new Pacific Highway. Initially I did not campaign for it to be part of the national highway system because all I was concerned with was getting the money and I did not care what it was called. But circumstances have changed and I believe that it is important that the Pacific Highway should now become part of the national highway system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of economic benefits it is interesting to look at a study done in 1984&mdash;and it is still relevant today&mdash;by the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities (NAASRA). That study showed that for every $1 million spent on roads 88 jobs would be created, 37 of those in road construction, 14 in allied supply industries, and 37 in other industry sectors because of the multiplier effect. That is a substantial benefit to the whole of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Industry Economics indicated some years ago that every $1 million spent on the tourism industry created 26 new jobs. We all applauded that and we all support the tourism industry in its efforts to grow and to create more employment. But even that pales into insignificance when we compare it with the number of jobs created by money spent on roads. For every $1 million spent on roadworks, 64 per cent is spent on wages and salaries. That, of course, has a very beneficial effect when the multiplier effect comes in and it leads to a reduction in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new highway would improve road access to the north coast and certainly between Brisbane and Sydney. A better road means better support for industry and increased employment. My colleagues on the north coast who are in the chamber at the moment, the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), know all too well that unemployment in that area is at a most unsatisfactory level. It is close to twice the national figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The savings that come from better roads, good roads, are absolutely exceptional. They occur in vehicle wear and tear costs, fuel costs, occupant travel time&mdash;both private and commercial&mdash;lower freight costs, less road maintenance, lower accident costs, less government expenditure on hospitals and health and emergency services and lower insurance costs and third party premiums and property legal costs. The benefits are right across the whole of the economy. I refer to a report done some little time ago by the NRMA which indicated that a reduction in crashes of up to 90 per cent occurs where an old two-lane highway is replaced by a modern four-lane divided dual carriageway. The cost savings from that are absolutely enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NAASRA, again back in 1984, indicated that a 25 per cent increase in road funding nationally would produce savings of 125 million litres of fuel. That is quite extraordinary. But the research was accurate and is viable and valid. If, by increasing road spending by 25 per cent, we can save 125 million litres of fuel a year that amounts to, at the current price of fuel in my electorate of about 74.9c per litre, $9.362 billion a year. Over $9 billion a year can be saved in fuel consumption by increasing road expenditure by 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The call for a new Pacific Highway, and for it to be a national highway, has very wide community support. Members of this House will recall that some time ago I presented petitions, with 50,000 signatures from right around Australia, calling for the upgrading of the Pacific Highway. It is not just a move from the people of the north coast of New South Wales, it is a move that is endorsed by all of Australia. Over the years I have had many letters and calls from my own constituents and from people all around Australia. The community support is there.

This is the way it has to be. We need to work together for the benefit of the people we serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a series of questions on notice to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) to which I received a response some weeks ago. One of those questions asked whether the government would go ahead and make the Pacific Highway a national highway. The answer to that was a very simple two-letter word and it was no. I can understand why the minister under the present circumstances would give that answer but I and my colleagues up and down the coast, of all political persuasions, do not accept that is the last answer. We believe that we have to work together to get a change, whether directly from the federal government through the minister or through cooperation with the New South Wales government. I believe that consideration and discussion between both governments is essential to get to the end result.</PARA>

The Northern Rivers Regional Organisation of Councils together with the North Coast Regional Organisation of Councils held a very important meeting at Ballina only about 10 days ago, which was attended by representatives of local government, by both government and coalition members of the federal parliament and by state members from northern New South Wales. The Labor shadow minister from New South Wales also appeared. As a result of that we have set up a group which is going to work as a joint state-federal local government group to achieve the end that we need. I am delighted that this has happened. It has me representing the opposition and, I think, my colleague from Page representing the government on it&mdash;we are not quite certain just yet. It has representatives from the transport industry&mdash;Reg Mills from road transport and Kevin Kirkland from the coach industry. The chief engineer of the NRMA, Peter Steele, is also a member of it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the Pacific Highway between Hexham and Queensland should be part of the national highway system. By any measure, the Pacific Highway is the major economic route between Sydney and Brisbane. I think a mistake was made some years ago when the New England Highway was included in the national highway system. At that time the Pacific Highway should have been made part of the national highway system, as it should be now. Therefore the motion moved by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) is worthy of very careful consideration by this government and the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, because of various considerations I think the motion is premature. What we really have to consider is what will deliver the best outcomes for highway improvements. There is no doubt that improvements are needed and that there is a need for a large amount of additional expenditure on the highway. But how those improvements and how the additional money can be provided is the question that we really need to be addressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently the New South Wales government has a proposal on the board for the development of Motorway Pacific, which is a private tollway. That proposal is in a state of flux and, with the debate being engaged in by those who would be likely to be traditional National Party supporters in the northern part of the state, that state of flux could persist for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just give a brief outline of some of that debate. A leaked document from the Roads and Traffic Authority was publicised in local media a few months ago. It suggested the Pacific Motorway would go through large areas of productive agricultural land, land that was predominantly used for growing sugarcane. Understandably that has caused considerable anxiety in the sugar industry, whose senior representatives have seen me about the proposal. They suggest to me that the loss of productive land could result in about $2 million worth of lost production to the sugar industry annually. That loss, they say, could make the three New South Wales sugar mills and the new Harwood Manildra sugar refinery in my electorate unviable. This is only a few years after the industry invested millions of dollars in its refining facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, even if the state government decides that it will proceed with the Pacific Motorway proposal, the opposition from the sugar industry&mdash;which traditionally supports the National Party&mdash;means that there will be difficulty, just on that ground, in getting the proposal implemented. But until some decision is reached future arrangements for the Pacific Highway, including the state government's funding arrangements, will be under question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Cowper would have seen the result of this indecision in his own electorate at the site of one of the worst traffic black spots on the entire highway. The federal government, through the previous Minister for Land Transport, offered the state government funding to replace the Raleigh Bridge, the site of numerous fatalities and accidents. The federal government set aside money especially for that project and it was ready to provide it when the state government decided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For reasons which are beyond my comprehension, the then New South Wales Minister for Roads, Mr Wal Murray, refused to accept the money saying that it may be part of the Motorway Pacific proposal. But, as reports in the honourable member's local media suggest, that is only part of the story. Those reports said that political pressure from former high profile National Party members for that area stopped Roads and Traffic Authority plans for the replacement of the bridge from proceeding. That was because the bridge would have gone through part of that former member's land. Meetings were set up with the RTA and those plans were dropped. We now have the absurd situation that a roundabout has been put in at the southern approach to the bridge, and in my view it does nothing to improve traffic flow or safety. I understand trucks continue to crash there pretty regularly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Cowper would also be aware, the July 1991 Premiers Conference resolved to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each level of government, for road funding, maintenance and improvements. That agreement, signed by New South Wales, reinforced the historic links between the New South Wales government and its commitment to the Pacific Highway. In other words, the state government agreed, as part of that agreement, to fully fund improvement works to the highway as it had always done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that agreement the Commonwealth agreed to provide an additional $100 million to New South Wales in untied grants. That commitment more than compensated for the withdrawal of the $50 million annually that the Commonwealth had provided to the highway under a 1990 state-Commonwealth Pacific Highway funding package. Until the current agreement expires there is really nothing this parliament can do to accept full funding responsibility without the endorsement of the New South Wales government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had the formation of a task force on the New South Wales coast, which the honourable member for Cowper mentioned, to examine the whole raft of issues which are involved in giving the Pacific Highway national status. That task force, of which I am a member, is not due to release any report until April next year, and I believe it will not release its final report until March 1995. At this stage there have been very few discussions, if any, between the state and federal governments, or their agencies, about the possibility of transferring an agreement about funding. Those discussions obviously would need to occur before there was any decision from this parliament supporting full federal funding for the Pacific Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion of the honourable member for Cowper, I believe, is premature in at least four ways. It precedes the expiry of the agreements reached at the 1991 Premiers Conference; it precedes the New South Wales government's release of its intentions with the Motorway Pacific proposal; it precedes the release of the findings and the recommendations of the task force which has been formed; and it precedes discussions between state and federal governments on future funding responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contend that it also precedes consideration of what is probably the most fundamental of the issues, and that is what the national highway system is. The national highway system was introduced in 1974 to improve the efficiency of interstate transport and commerce. Its basic aim was to provide a single route between capital cities. Currently we have that route via the New England Highway. To declare the Pacific Highway the national highway would require the state government to pick up funding for the New England Highway; it would require that highway to be released from the national highway system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a recent task force meeting the honourable member for Cowper said that that was politically unachievable. I guess what he meant by that was that the National Party powerbrokers west of the range&mdash;people like state National Party member for Clarence, Ian Causley&mdash;will not allow that to happen. But if we are talking about providing the funding levels that are needed to get the Pacific Highway to an acceptable standard then I believe that is something that would have to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We often hear the term `a problem shared is a problem halved'. That could apply to road funding. If the federal government is funding two highway systems within the one state, in parallel, then neither gets the funding it requires. That is something that should be well and truly understood by the entire parliament. After all, it was the coalition's Fightback document that was promoting a cut in government outlays of $10 billion. I am led to believe that that document still breathes life. The point is that the need to reduce government outlays means that the government cannot allocate funds to two separate interstate highway systems running parallel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support any moves which will increase the amount of funding for the Pacific Highway and which will, therefore, improve its condition. I believe that, in principle, the Pacific Highway should be part of the national highway system. It is the premier route for trade and tourism, and it traverses the region with the fastest population growth in the nation. The reasons for declaring the New England Highway as the national highway are obsolete and do not need to be revisited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has the financial capacity in the long term to provide the level of funding which would make substantial improvements to the Pacific Highway. However, the private member's motion before the House this morning is premature. I have outlined why. Each of these issues, together with a raft of others, needs to be considered before national status can be seriously considered for the Pacific Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the next eight years, particularly as we approach the Olympic Games in the year 2000, I fear that there is going to be an enormous increase in the volume of traffic on the Pacific Highway.

It may well be premature in the light of some of the other decisions that need to be made ahead of it by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), but it is certainly a very important issue that must be brought to the surface and kept there until it is dealt with.

The highway serves not only the long distance traveller but also the local communities along its length. The condition of the Pacific Highway has been described by the Roads and Traffic Authority as `moderate, with almost a quarter of the highway unacceptably rough'. Delays on the highway result from the existing road alignment, periodic flooding, narrow bridges and congestion, and those delays extend journey times by 10 per cent under normal conditions and by up to 18 per cent during holiday times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pacific Highway, therefore, is in urgent need of large quantities of capital outlay to ensure safer, more efficient transport use.

While I welcome the joint efforts of the federal and state governments to improve the Pacific Highway in areas such as Herons Creek and between Taree and Port Macquarie, as well as the Taree traffic relief route, and I congratulate them on those efforts, what is now needed is a long-term commitment to improving the Pacific Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While $100 million dollars has been spent over the last three years following that meeting of the states and the consequent agreement, we need to get a strategy in place so that we do not have to come back on bended knee every so many years asking for funding for the Pacific Highway. I refer the government to a report by the NRMA entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country or coast: a motorists comparison of the Pacific and New England highways</EMPHASIS>. The NRMA supports the position taken by honourable members on this side of the House today: due to the ongoing cost of human tragedy, and due to the growth in travel, Australia can ill afford not to improve the Pacific Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A comparison of the Pacific Highway and the New England Highway provides a very good way of looking at this issue. It is well documented that the Pacific Highway carries almost twice the volume of traffic which is carried by the New England Highway.

Tragically, 194 fatalities occurred on the Pacific Highway and only 54 occurred on the New England Highway.

One example in my electorate has been the Herons Creek deviation, which I alluded to earlier, between Taree and Port Macquarie. That has removed an extremely dangerous stretch of road which has been the scene of many fatalities in recent times.

I have heard the silly argument that the inclusion of the Pacific Highway in this program would see the diversion of funds from other national highway projects, which would result in a higher death rate nationally. The NRMA and most people who know anything about our road system argue that this should not occur.

The Newell Highway, to the north in New South Wales and west of the New England Highway, the national highway link, has been added to the system. There was a Premiers Conference in 1991 at which road responsibilities were reviewed and determined. An agreement between the New South Wales government and the federal government made it very clear that the Pacific Highway is a state responsibility and would remain that way. Honourable members opposite are trying to find some other means of funding the Pacific Highway because they have no confidence that their own party colleagues at state government level in New South Wales will carry out the task. That is the essence of this whole debate. </PARA>

Interregional or local traffic is being choked up with the interstate traffic that need not be there, and that problem ought to be addressed. It can be addressed immediately; it does not cost money. If we are really committed to reducing road crashes and casualties, we should be saying to the police on the Pacific Highway, `Let's put the police patrols out there to supervise the sections of the road that are hazardous and where, if a once-a-year driver travels and exceeds the speed limit, that driver is likely to get into trouble'. The police should not be put on the new sections of road where they are taxing drivers&mdash;revenue raising&mdash;by sitting there with radar and pinching people who inadvertently exceed the speed limit.

The plain fact for tourism on the Gold Coast is that the vast majority of our visitors from intrastate and interstate come by road, and most of them that come from down south, as most of them do, come on the Pacific Highway. The real point is that they are entitled to travel on a road of a reasonable standard. Clearly, the Pacific Highway does not meet that criterion. </PARA>

They make that choice, and it is obviously the ideal choice for most people for their family holiday. I enjoy driving up and down the Pacific Highway even though I have done it many times. It runs through one of the most picturesque parts of Australia, and people want to travel such a route. It is a part of the enjoyment of their holiday to make the decision to drive on the Pacific Highway through New South Wales and into Queensland.

If there had been a concerted effort at that time&mdash;that is not to say there have not been improvements; there has been some action that we have noticed&mdash;to do something dramatic to fix the Pacific Highway, we probably would not be in here today talking about the problem still being an ongoing one. </PARA>

In effect, we should not have to even make that choice. The fact is that there are adequate funds available for road funding in this country and, clearly, the money is not being spent on roads. That concerns me more than anything about this particular argument. The fuel excise that the government collects has never been spent entirely on roads. In fact, increasingly over time, it has been spent less and less on roads. In 1975, close to three-quarters of it was allocated to road funding yet, in 1991-92, only one-fifth of fuel excise was actually spent on road funding. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member well knows, the villain is the government of which the honourable member was once a minister. Having heard the honourable member today, I now understand why he no longer is a minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go back to the other matter. My concern today is that, around the world, sadly, there are still so many suffering in a fundamental way. Human rights are of two orders and, in this country, the basic human rights are something that nobody questions. They are the right of individual freedom, of liberty, and of freedom from repression, where the rule of law prevails and where the presumption of innocence, generally, is still paramount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is another dimension to human rights and that is, of course, the democratic extension of freedom that is part of the Atlantic charter and that is something which, again, we take for granted. It is a process of individual choice that determines the governments that, for the time being in this country, governs not only a federal level but also in each of the states. Of course, the benefits of democracy are apparent in the way in which, in South Australia at the weekend, a government that had been in office for some years was swept from office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few moments that are available to me today, I wanted to identify a country that is close to us and that, too often, is ignored when we look at the increasing influence Australia seeks to exercise in Asia. Of course, I am referring to Burma or, as the generals who, regrettably, are still in power in that country like to call it, Myanmar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980 there was in fact a democratic election in Myanmar. That election gave an 80 per cent majority to a group which, under any ordinary circumstances, one would now expect to be exercising the responsibility for that government. Sadly, of course, it is not doing so. I want to look at Burma's situation today and what we are doing, and what we can do, in relation to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the review by the human rights subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in December 1992 on Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights, there is a very good extract on Burma on page 85. I do not intend to refer to it other than to mention that it is there. In that report, there were a number of recommendations made. Those recommendations are in paragraph 7.20 on pages 87 and 88. The government responded through Senator Gareth Evans on 27 May 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are within those recommendations a number of points which are to be commended. Others I disagree with, and in that respect agree with some of the government's general rejection of them. But what I want to do is to look at Burma's situation today. I want to try to suggest to the media and to the Australian electorate that, for all that we are comfortable in the development of our relationships with ASEAN and with other countries of Asia, we need to understand that it is not the impetuous type of reaction that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gave the Prime Minister of Malaysia a little while ago that is going to determine the relationship that we should have. Whether it is through Amnesty, whether it is through the vocal identification of sins against the individual&mdash;and they are sins; they are grievous sins; they are heinous sins; they imperil daily the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in one of our close neighbour countries&mdash;it is the way in which we approach these matters that the measure of our capacity as a responsible member of this region of which we are a geographic part will be determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel quite strongly that too little is being done by us in the forums available to try to identify the problems in Burma, and indeed in some of the other countries around us. In emphasising my concern about Burma, I am not dismissing the problems that exist elsewhere. Indeed, I was rather horrified to read, from a fairly astute observer who recently has been in Burma and lives in Asia, in a letter to me that general feeling in Thailand is that things in Burma are overrated, that it is no worse than China, Cambodia or, for that matter, parts of black America. Business and corruption are booming, with huge sales of flash cars. But the real area of concern the letter identifies is the fate and circumstances of the person about whom so much has been said, and about whom we all feel so strongly, and that is Aung San Suu Kyi. She is a former leader of the party which won 80 per cent of the vote in the 1990 elections. She was given the Nobel Peace Prize because of the efforts she has made to try to establish a normal civilian government within Burma, and yet she remains totally confined to her own individual house and, according to a report that I have, only a few weeks old, that barricade, for all that it was temporarily reduced, remains almost impenetrable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to briefly identify the circumstances. There is not a great deal of time but there are a few extracts that I can refer to. The first is that there are certainly violations not only against democracy but against individuals, and the sad part is that there are ethnic minorities, in this year of ethnic people, who are in an appalling state in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here are some of the facts and figures: there are 70,000 Burmese refugees on the Thai side of the Thai-Burma border, most from the Karen, Mon and Karehni ethnic groups. There are probably between 1,000 and 2,500 Burmese dissident students in camps on the border. There are a further 2,000 to 4,000 or more Burmese students and other asylum seekers in Bangkok. As a consequence of the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in the north-eastern Burmese state of Arakan, 250,000 of them sought refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh. So there are 300,000 or 400,000 people who are refugees from this regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are stories of the way in which people are shackled and handled, people used as human porters, chained together, absolutely horrific tales of what is happening. Yet so much of it is ignored and there has been so little progress. Sadly, countries in our region, Japan and Thailand, to name but two, are prepared to condone these actions by the generals in Burma and are providing aid, and in some circumstances seem to be talking about an easing of the oppression there. I see no signs of it. Like so many of the measures taken by the military government in Burma, I think that it has all been more for a bit of face-saving and to try to create an impression that they really are trying to fundamentally relieve the obvious concern that they have about the international perspective of conditions there. As was said in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS> only recently, most of the changes are purely cosmetic. The oppression continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the real barb in my comments is based on the fact that I know that there are moves in the United States to introduce economic sanctions. In fact, the recommendation of our own committee was that Australia should seek to move within the United Nations for the removal of Burma from the United Nations. The reply was about how difficult that would be. An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Atlanta Journal and Constitution</EMPHASIS> identifies something which we need to be aware of. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Burma's generals are devious and mercurial. The few steps forward could be undone in a day, but they are an indication that even this, one of the world's stubbornest tyrannies, will squirm uncomfortably under the glare of bad publicity and the worldwide clamour for justice.</PARA>
<PARA>This is no time for outsiders to pause and rejoice. It is time to intensify the pressure. There is little doubt that publicising oppression and identifying abuses against human rights, where they exist, can evoke a positive response, even from the likes of the generals in Burma. This motion identifies a way in which this parliament can help that cause. I commend the motion to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion on human rights and strongly endorse the comments of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I share with him a total commitment to tackling the fundamental abuses of human rights that are occurring in Burma. This motion on human rights is supported by members on both sides of this House. That reflects the fact that the commitment to human rights is a non-partisan issue in this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All political parties in this parliament have an equal commitment to the pursuit of human rights internationally. It has been my pleasure to work very closely with the right honourable member for New England on the human rights subcommittee, with the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) in the parliamentary branch of Amnesty International, and with a lot of other members on both sides of this House. We have pursued the question of human rights and tried to ensure that this parliament takes seriously its obligations in asserting the fundamental belief in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the need for us, as a nation, to pursue the objectives of that declaration wherever and whenever we believe it is important and necessary to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1948, when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was proclaimed by one of the first general assemblies of the United Nations, it has been the foundation of the world's approach to human rights. It has been endorsed by all member countries of the United Nations. I quote from the preamble:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, therefore, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY</EMPHASIS> proclaims</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of the Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA>As the right honourable member for New England has so strongly asserted, Burma is a member of the United Nations. It is committed to this declaration of human rights, and yet it is flagrantly breaching almost every clause of this declaration in the way in which it is treating its people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Burma is not alone in its abuse of this declaration. Unfortunately, many other member states of the United Nations also breach the principles and articles that are espoused in this declaration. Even within Australia, the treatment of the indigenous people demonstrates a flagrant abuse of some of the articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For the benefit of the House, I will quote from the articles of the declaration. Article 1 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.</PARA>
<PARA>Those three important articles lay the foundation for our analysis of what is happening around the world today. It is my assessment, and I do not think it is an unreasonable assessment, that the abuse of human rights in 1993 is as bad as it has ever been. There are too many instances still occurring around this world where those fundamental articles are being breached every single day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that in this country, unfortunately, we are also doing that&mdash;although not to anywhere near the same extent as has occurred in Burma, or the People's Republic of China, or Yugoslavia, or some other places around the world. However, I do believe that we are guilty of breaches ourselves. It is important that, if we as a country are going to attend international forums asserting a belief in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and asserting a belief that human rights are a fundamental principle that all countries should be adhering to, then we need to get our own house in order as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, this morning I tabled in this House a report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs&mdash;a committee which I have the pleasure to chair and of which you are, of course, a very valued member. Within that report I outlined that there are still some very significant issues affecting access and equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country to basic services. It is my assertion that we are not respecting their basic human rights. The indigenous people of this country are not having their basic human rights protected and respected while we continue to deny them access to basic services that the rest of the community in this country can enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the health statistics of this country for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, if one looks at the situation with regard to their access to education, to employment, to equal opportunity throughout our society, then it is very clear that the indigenous people of this country have not been having their human rights respected. It is the obligation and responsibility of all members of this parliament and this community to work as hard as they can to make sure that they advance their rights as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that until we get our own house in order we can have little credibility around the rest of the world in asserting our belief in human rights. I do believe our society is founded on all of the principles that are outlined in this Universal Declaration of Human Rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Australians all believe in these things but unfortunately a belief in them does not necessarily always transfer into the delivery of services to enable these to occur. It is important that we act wherever we can to ensure that we are giving all people in our community their equal rights and their access to equal treatment under government services. But what is important, and this contrasts with what is happening in most other countries, is that as a nation we are willing to expose ourselves to international scrutiny. Not many other countries are prepared to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the human rights subcommittee received evidence from Mr E.G. Whitlam in a public hearing of the human rights committee. He tabled at that hearing the evidence that he had presented as part of the Sydney 2000 bid for the Olympic Games. It is very compelling evidence and I think it needs to be noted here in the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is the only country which permits a UN committee to consider complaints from individuals within its jurisdiction that they are victims of a violation of their rights under any UN convention. We are one of the few countries that is prepared to allow open and full scrutiny by whatever UN committee is responsible for adhering to the conventions or administering or supervising conventions and protocols. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also the only country which permits a UN committee to consider complaints from other countries that we are not fulfilling our obligations under any UN convention. A lot of other countries will allow it under some conventions and not others, but we are one of the very few countries&mdash;in fact, as far as Mr Whitlam is concerned, the only one&mdash;in the world that allows full and open scrutiny. That is very important. It means that at least we are prepared to enable people to look at what we are doing and that we are prepared to accept criticism. Hopefully, we are as a nation prepared to act upon that criticism and implement the proper strategies to correct the deficiencies that such an analysis might demonstrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are too many abuses of human rights still occurring around the world. If we are to seriously believe in the credibility of the United Nations, it is absolutely vital that that organisation seek to assert its responsibilities with regard to the supervision of the covenants and declarations that a lot of the member countries have signed. We need to make sure that in the work of the United Nations the pursuit of human rights gains top priority, because it is, I believe, the most important issue facing the world today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important motion and one which I commend to the House. It is a pity we do not vote on these motions because I would like to see this one formally passed. It is a motion to affirm, at the time of the International Human Rights Day&mdash;its actual date is 10 December&mdash;our commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and paragraph (3) asserts that. The motion also is designed to encourage the government in its efforts to promote and protect human rights through active involvement in national forums, and that will be the subject of most of my comments today. However, before the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) departs, I do have some observations that I wish to make about paragraph (2).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (2) makes it clear that what we are concerned about are human rights of very significant proportion, such as matters relating to ethnic cleansing. Cleansing denotes some cleaning but, when we think of it in terms of what we have seen in the former Yugoslavia, it connotes something that the name just does not suggest; something more horrific than most of us have ever seen or imagined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paragraph deals with warlords and the sorts of things we have heard of in countries like Colombia, where people involved in making money out of drugs are able to dominate a whole society. It deals with issues of torture, detention without trial and disappearances. It does not deal with the death penalty&mdash;that is a matter about which I would make some observations&mdash;but it deals with matters of very major human rights abuse, and it deals with minority groups forced to live under repression, disadvantage and injustice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moreton raises properly the concern that all people in Australia ought to have and enjoy access and equity. He also raises properly the concern that I would have that we ought not to be raising human rights issues of substance if there are substantial human rights abuses in our own country. But in the same speech he mentioned some comments of Mr Whitlam about the openness of our society. I simply observe that we have had a Labor government federally in Australia now for 10 years, Labor governments in most of the states of Australia, and Aborigines in preponderance in those states where Labor governments have been in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply make the observation that I find the equation of our record on Aboriginal affairs with some of the other human rights abuses that we know occur in other parts of the world as diminishing at times our ability to raise those issues of substance, because people look at us and say, `You are raising a matter of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, but what are you doing about your Aborigines in Australia?'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us understand what is happening internationally. This motion is about what Australia ought to be doing in the international forums. I draw to the attention of honourable members one of the international forums that held great potential for advancing human rights: the World Conference on Human Rights. I simply observe that, for a parliament that has had many people involved in human rights issues&mdash;most members of parliament are involved with the parliamentary Amnesty group, and a foreign affairs committee has one of its subcommittees dealing with human rights issues&mdash;the quality of participation from Australia, and from those members of parliament who have an interest in human rights, was lamentable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who were involved&mdash;and all of them with substantial recognition in this place of their interest in human rights: Vicki Bourne, Brian Harradine, Senator Reynolds and I&mdash;were invited to assist Australia, after all the preparatory committees had been dealt with and all of the substantial discussion had been undertaken. We were invited rather belatedly, three weeks before the conference was being held, to participate&mdash;long after all the documentation had been settled, and long after Australia had undertaken a plan of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I encourage honourable members to read the report that was tabled in the other place. I am sorry that it is not being debated in this place, because what comes out in that report&mdash;particularly in my comments as one of the parliamentary advisers, along with those of Senator Brian Harradine&mdash;is that we went into a conference that had been well planned, with very little notice. It was a conference with much potential. With the new East-West relationships, many of the previous obstacles to meaningful advances on civil and political rights had been removed, so this was a unique opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had countries of the former Soviet Union&mdash;and other, independent, countries of eastern Europe&mdash;who are now taking the same sort of position as we have traditionally taken on issues relating to civil and political rights. Most western European states were vigorous and persistent in stressing the need for progress in promoting civil and political rights. Many countries of Asia, however&mdash;Japan and the Philippines, in particular&mdash;supported this agenda, while others of the Group of 77 emphasised economic, historical, political and cultural differences as a justification for different standards on political and civil rights questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those countries, some of whom we regard as our closest friends, seemed to be taking up the arguments of the old eastern European regimes of the past. The persistence and stridency of their arguments suggested to many observers that the basic theme of universality of human rights and the common adherence to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights might be at risk. That is what we saw at that conference: the stratagems and manoeuvres of those regimes&mdash;which raised the prospect of the conference failing to endorse the Vienna Declaration&mdash;seemed to put at risk things such as the universal covenant we have accepted for 50 years. I must say that that was the most appalling prospect I could have foreseen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is against the backdrop of those sorts of arguments that Australia's role, it seemed to me, was most modest and disappointing. Against the outcome of the conference, our approach may have seemed reasonable, but the fact is that, as parliamentary advisers, we came to see the decisions of the conference&mdash;which others accepted with resignation&mdash;as being most disappointing. Australia's contribution to the plenary debate set very modest objectives. Senator Gareth Evans's address showed that, and I would encourage honourable members to look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was apparent from Senator Evans's comments that there was a signal that certain meaningful advances&mdash;such as Amnesty's proposal, which he said had very considerable merit, for a special commissioner on human rights&mdash;could be compromised to produce what he termed a `blended outcome'. Likewise, an initiative that the Labor Party had long been committed to&mdash;a human rights court&mdash;was also a matter about which Senator Evans's thought was doubtful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw Australia's contribution&mdash;we have seen it with the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;couched in language to signal a more pragmatic and progressive approach to human rights questions. It was argued that this would enable us to play a more significant role in brokering compromises in the drafting sessions, despite the real prospect of it being read as going well beyond the protection and promotion of economic, social and cultural rights. Compared with our record in the past, I found this lowest common denominator trade-off a most bitter disappointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gareth Evans went weak in relation to the issue of a human rights commissioner, and that matter was referred to the General Assembly of the United Nations. I was most pleased to read that, with the support of the United States&mdash;not of Australia&mdash;it appears that the United Nations, because of compromises that have been reached, will appoint a high commissioner on human rights, with the same status as the High Commissioner for Refugees. If that occurs this year, it will be one of the most meaningful advances in human rights. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Human rights is one of those universal questions. Nation states have no sovereign right to abuse their own people and they should be answerable to the international community for the treatment of their people.

Although we have the International Court of Justice, its powers are limited. The human rights treaties are supervised by a series of United Nations committees which are set under each convention. Their powers are limited to persuasion and advice; they set standards and expose justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia believes in the importance of human rights as defined in the universal declaration, and supports the United Nations in the protection of them. However, there are gaps in our own practice which diminish our international stance on the question. The Australian constitution gives treaty power to the federal government. Australia has ratified 19 of the 24 major instruments in the UN field but has placed reservations on a number of significant articles in these conventions and has been slow to alter them. Australia's position on these articles, relating to the passing of legislation outlawing racial vilification, the separation of adults and juveniles in gaols, and those articles which allow individuals to make complaints to the various human rights committees, has detracted from our position, reflects weaknesses in our human rights record and may inhibit the full exercise of rights within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few topics generate as much discussion in the media today as human rights. Yet when one looks around the world, the situation in regard to human rights is, indeed, very dismal. Forty-five years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights it could be argued that today more people are denied basic human rights than at any other time&mdash;or is it that we are more aware of this denial of human rights?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, it must be admitted that there have been some notable achievements, yet much more needs to be done. In the international arena Australia has worked to establish, at the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, a United Nations commissioner for human rights. Like the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), I was delighted to read in the paper yesterday of the imminent appointment of such a commissioner. I have had discussions with people from Foreign Affairs, who told me that the appointment may be made as early as next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take exception to what the honourable member for Berowra said when he said that it was at the American insistence. Our delegation at the United Nations, right from the time of the Vienna conference and during this current session, has worked tirelessly to see that the appointment of a commissioner for human rights becomes a reality and, as I said, it has already been approved by the third committee. Next week it will become a reality and we all welcome that. A commissioner would coordinate existing UN human rights activity and provide flexibility and high level direction. The appointment of such a commissioner, at the conclusion of what has been a landmark year for human rights, will be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this position to be fully effective such an office within the UN would have to be properly funded. One of the real difficulties in coming to grips with the human rights situations is the lack of resources for human rights, especially at the United Nations. Human Rights Day marks the adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights some 45 years ago on 10 December 1948. The universal declaration represents the most fundamental expression of international human rights principles and provides the standards by which all country's human rights credentials are measured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will continue to work vigorously both bilaterally and multilaterally for the realisation of human rights principles set out in that declaration. In this context the government recently published a human rights manual which sets out the human rights dimensions and objectives of Australian foreign policy. Nevertheless, human rights is not a simple, easily applied formula. Basic rights to life and freedom are a necessary condition for any human activity but the question remains whether such rights are limited, as in classical liberal concepts, to legal and political guarantees. The United Nations asserts the contrary&mdash;that satisfactory economic and social conditions are also a human right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, some Third World countries claim priority for development and social rights rather than Western legal and political rights, although whether such social rights really exist for the majority and not just for the privileged minority is another matter. Nevertheless, the two claims need not be contradictory for it is evident that a basic minimum standard of living is required for freedom to be effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Difficult or abstract as some issues on human rights may be, nevertheless certain common themes are universal. Human rights means putting people first as the fundamental members of civilised life. This is not to say that human rights dictate a particular form of government or society but rather that observance of human rights provides the essential minimum standard on the basis of which members of society can freely choose their form of rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments do not always put the same weight on individual's rights as on those of social collectives. Thus their perceptions of human rights, even when using the same language to describe them, may be markedly different. Since this issue tends to emerge in countries which are not democracies it is not easy to judge whether their citizens hold the same view. In addition to classic rights which Western observers have in mind when they speak of human rights, there are those set out in the universal declaration and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Many non-Western observers argue that the promotion of economic rights should proceed and are a prerequisite for the promotion of civil and political rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relative importance of economic, social and cultural rights remains an unresolved issue in international forums. In this debate ideological issues are important, perhaps because this is where they saw their strength. Centrally planned countries commonly put greater emphasis on economic rights and play down the importance of civil and political rights. For the opposite reason, Western countries tend to argue the reverse and give pre-eminence to civil and political rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, developing countries understandably emphasise the importance of economic rights, but they also point to the cost of maintaining other human rights, including the substantial cost of effective law and order itself, without which human rights are difficult to protect. For Australia this debate has a particular edge, since most of its neighbours are developing countries. Within limits, it can claim to have helped to create a situation, through its trade, aid and other policies, in which development is encouraged in line with the priorities of those countries themselves. This provides some of the prerequisites for developing improved human rights. At the same time, economic growth, through the increased pressure it puts on established authority, may give rise to the political conditions under which human rights abuses may occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are brushing up our human rights image internationally, Australia should consider removing the reservations that we have to various human rights treaties. We have, first of all, a reservation to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Basically it is a reservation which says that Australia has not yet got around to passing laws about race vilification. Australia ratified the convention in 1974 and declared that we were not at that time in a position specifically to treat as offences all matters covered by article 4, which deals with race vilification. It was said in 1974 that it was the intention of the government at the first suitable moment to seek from parliament legislation specifically implementing the terms of article 4(a). Almost 20 years have passed since we said that. It raises a question of good faith. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is hard to know how to cover such a sweeping resolution in five short minutes. What I do know, however, is that it is particularly appropriate that members of parliament comment on and fight for human rights. Too many prisoners of conscience or victims of oppression or injustice suffer because of politics; not just for their own practice of the sort of politics that we play out in this place but, more importantly, the politics of race, the politics of religion or the politics of gender.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion mentions the International Year of the World's Indigenous People. We can never forget the gross disadvantage our own Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people suffer. Remedying this, giving them true justice, will not only create real reconciliation, it will remove the one negative from our country's human rights record. For, despite this, we should take pride in our human rights efforts. This does not mean we can pontificate. Instead, we should draw moral strength from the fact that we have successfully created one of the most multicultural and tolerant societies in the world, instilled with the Western democratic tradition, enriched by indigenous culture and enhanced by postwar migrants. This should not just be a happy coincidence, it should be a goal for every nation, and we must play a role in helping other lands repeat our success. In too many countries transfer of political power is a matter of force. The relatively high freedom we enjoy in Australia is a continuing reminder of the positive contribution that we can make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this century, involvement in the political process has largely given rise to violation of human rights. Historically, race or practice of religion has probably been more important in incurring brutality. But now, with the collapse of socialism, we are seeing these old cruelties re-emerge. The wars of Africa and Latin America are no longer battles of superpower proxies. They hark back to older, darker conflicts or are the power plays of warlords. The nations of eastern Europe, freed from one group of despots, now threaten to tear themselves apart over ancient hatreds. Western Europe remains impotent in the face of slaughter on its doorstep. Bosnia no longer leads our nightly news. We are either immune to its horrors or do not wish to be reminded. The end of the cold war has ended many certainties. It is frightening, indeed evil, to hear a new breed Russian politician like Vladimir Zhirinovsky talk of the Jewish conspiracies to ultranationalists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, one good thing has come of it. It means that, in our fight against violence, oppression, disadvantage and injustice, we can be indiscriminating. It means we can believe in the true universality of dignity and human rights. One side can no longer talk of Warsaw or Managua while another tells of what is happening in Santiago or Johannesburg. We must speak a common language of freedom for Beijing and Dili, for Sarajevo and Baghdad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some hopeful signs. Those cities of the Cold War I mentioned earlier have all seen at least some tentative change. A wave of freedom is sweeping the world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Liberalism has contributed to this.

Hence it is not to be wondered at that this same humanity should soon appear anxious to get rid of it.</PARA>

These famous words are less true today because men and women everywhere are not in chains.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How painful and how lasting are the wounds of chains anyway? The child in chains suffers less than the girl child who suffers the worst form of female genital mutilation. Today the media is full of an AIDS tragedy in Sydney which affected four people. Unfortunately, the media has given less coverage to genital mutilation. Had the media spread the news more, a few million Australians would have been as horrified as I was to learn that female circumcision is being practised in our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Female circumcision is practised in some parts of Africa, Asia, South America and the Middle East, and that knowledge must horrify us all, but that such a detestable practice should be allowed in Australia is absolutely appalling. A Melbourne court has highlighted that infibulation&mdash;the worst form of female genital mutilation&mdash;has been carried out in Australia on baby girls. Infibulation is said to be practised in Sydney and many other Australian cities. Baby girls have their clitoris removed and the opening to their vagina stitched almost completely closed. Reports of such operations are chilling, but even more terrible is the fact that there is disagreement among lawyers, doctors and community groups as to whether education or prosecution is the best way to stamp out this practice. </PARA>

The shameful reservations that we filed in 1980 have largely been withdrawn and Australia now has three reservations and one declaration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the reservations that we still have, it is hard to say that any of them is justifiable. We have one with respect to article 10 in so far as the segregation referred to is considered by the responsible authorities to be beneficial to the juveniles or adults concerned. Indeed, this does become difficult and, at the human rights committee, the matter of juveniles and adults from the impounded boats being segregated was recently raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very curious, though, that Australia has attempted to second-guess, as it were, the international guarantees. Article 14 on miscarriage of justice is saying that we can use administrative procedures rather than special legal procedures. I do not really think there needs to be a reservation about that and I believe that having a reservation gives a wrong signal. It seems to me that Australian law is consistent with article 14 and there is no need for that reservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 20 is very similar to the racial discrimination reservation.

It could be argued that neither of these reservations is appropriate. The Australian government justifies the one on maternity leave by saying that we simply cannot impose the requirements of paid maternity leave. In fact, the convention does not actually require the imposition of this condition. There is no need to continue the reservation. With respect to women in combat positions, I think that the Defence Force's policy should be changed on that and that it should be urged to fall into line with our international obligations. </PARA>

I also express my delight, together with everyone associated with human rights, that, finally, next week, we will have a UN commissioner for human rights.

However, firstly, I note that it is important that each year this parliament take the opportunity to consider the plight of people around the world. Our contributions have all been different. We do not necessarily see human rights&mdash;within Australia, in our region, or in other countries&mdash;in the same light.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this motion on human rights encourages us all to recognise that there is a long way to go before equality exists in the world. Sadly, as we move towards the end of this century we have to accept that some people are still not treated as equals in some parts of the world. In spite of all the political, economic and technological changes in many so-called civilised countries, people are still incapable of overcoming the prejudices of the past. There are signs of change in some countries. One can only hope that with motions such as this one on human rights in this parliament and others there might be some progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two points that I want to add to my previous remarks on Burma. Firstly, it is absolutely tragic that the Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is still held in detention. She is a remarkable woman. She has been able to sustain herself with great courage and moral fibre, even confined as she is. She convincingly won an election, and yet she and her colleagues have been unable to take over the reins of government from the military that runs the country. It is sad that those who worked with her are also confined. Indeed, a number have recently been given incredibly long sentences simply for advocating freedom within Burma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is that countries that surround Burma must recognise that the world is not happy for those countries to lift the barriers on trade and commerce and to commend the generals for what has happened. A lot more needs to be done. Countries such as Japan, Thailand and China need to be told that the world does not kindly regard their action in removing those sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sanctions help, through force of public opinion and through efforts in the commercial sense, to make the generals realise that they must recognise the rights of the citizen. They must try to overcome their prejudices. They must believe that people cannot be treated like that. They must stop their appalling tyranny against the ethnic minorities. They must then accept the second phase of human rights, and move towards democratic government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion is not about any one country, as has correctly been said. We have been dealing with a number of countries. These are circumstances which are, regrettably, part of mankind's treatment of fellow human beings. Through motions such as this, the House is noting that people must look beyond themselves to others, and try to treat others as equals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion recognises in paragraph (3) that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is something that was set down after World War II in an attempt to highlight the need for greater emphasis on human rights around the world.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is now nine months since my election as the representative of the people of Stirling. It has been a most interesting gestation period. During this time, I have found my work to be both frustrating and rewarding&mdash;frustrating because of the various brick walls one runs into whilst trying to help one's constituents; rewarding when one is successful in helping them. There are many grievances I have which are worthy of bringing to the attention of the parliament, but the matter I would like to address in this debate is the politicisation of democracy. I realise it sounds like a contradiction in terms, but I do believe there is an opportunity to take politics out of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 13 March, the day that I entered the world of politics&mdash;or as many would say, and say with some merit, the world of fiction and delusion&mdash;I have seen many examples of the politicisation of government that are quite contemptuous of democracy and the principles of open and honest government. My comments, I should also add, are not confined to the federal Labor government. They apply to all governments at various times and I am sure the trend will continue into the future. I guess that, being politics, one should expect that most, if not all, government decisions are influenced by politics&mdash;even if only in a minor way. With many decisions though, the political overtones are enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a House of Representatives committee looking into the Auditor-General's report on the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program. I am very pleased to be a member of that committee. The reason for such an inquiry is due to the fact that&mdash;of $29.5 million allocated to different groups before the March election&mdash;groups in Labor held seats, which accounted for 53 per cent of the House of Representatives, received 73 per cent of the number of grants and 66 per cent of the value of the grants approved. I will not go into this matter at length, but we had a government department operating from the minister's office, allocating grants supposedly on a needs basis. However, when we look at the figures, they show that marginal Labor seats received twice as much in grants as coalition held seats. This must be either an amazing coincidence or blatant favouritism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a government scheme; a bureaucratic, dare I say it, impartial grants scheme, which has been politicised. It was a blatant attempt to buy votes. While the Labor Party may have written off the seats of Stirling and Cowan in Western Australia, it pooled a total of $948,000, a smidgin under a million dollars, into Swan and Canning, now the fourth and fifth most marginal Labor seats in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now even blind Freddy, or blind Ros, can see that something smells pretty bad about this whole situation. Taxpayers' money should not be used to buy votes. It is a slap in the face for democracy when a political party, with control over government funds, uses those funds in such a way as to influence the opinions of voters. The allocation of those grants ensured that the federal Labor Party was looked upon favourably in the climate of an election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, my comments apply to all political persuasions. In my own state of Western Australia, the coalition government has spent taxpayers' money on both pamphlets and television advertising explaining the WA government's Mabo legislation&mdash;legislation I wholeheartedly support. Although I support it, I find it difficult to defend the spending of taxpayers' money on the enunciation of the position of a political party, even though that party is in government and therefore has responsibility to make the laws of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public funds should not be used to try to influence the opinions of voters either one way or the other. Similarly, people who have a desire to enter this place, or remain in here, have a responsibility to ensure they uphold the principles of democracy by being honest in upholding their position, or the position they seek to hold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that, at the end of the day, the competition of politics is to win government. This is the reason we have the politicisation&mdash;bastardisation, if you like&mdash;of government and, therefore, democracy. For example, let us take the last election again; it does hurt me to have to recall the tragedy of that election. The Labor Party, in its attempt to hold onto government, misrepresented many of our policies. It said, for example, that everything would rise by 15 per cent as a result of the GST. As we all know, that was a complete and utter fabrication of the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we tried to be honest about it and fight the election on policies, the whole campaign concentrated on our policies and, regrettably, we lost to downright fibs. Democracy was dealt a severe blow by people's opinions being influenced by untruths, misrepresentations and outright lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One last aspect that I would like to mention is the speech made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) on the Native Title Bill. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie had a disagreement with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the Mabo legislation. The media lapped it up; the honourable member for Kalgoorlie milked it for all the publicity he could get, as is his wont; but then he completely sold out his own electorate. He voted with the Prime Minister in favour of this legislation, despite saying that he opposed it. He cared not one jot about his responsibility to the people of Kalgoorlie. He said one thing, but when the blowtorch was applied to the belly he went to water. That is particularly undemocratic. He cared more about his position in his own party and his chances of holding on to Labor Party preselection than voting according to what are the best interests of his electorate, which is why he was elected. Shame on him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these examples show blatant politicisation of our democratic processes. They are examples of the elected representatives speaking<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">or acting in a certain way to seek favourable support from their constituency, despite those actions being illegal, immoral, improper or downright unethical. It is high time politics returned to being a domain where members were elected honestly, where their actions were taken on the basis of what is right, not what will win the most votes, and where the institution of democracy was respected. If politicians continue to act in a way that will win most votes, our country's living standards are destined to continue to fall. It is high time decisions were made without regard to how many votes will come out of those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the voters have an equal responsibility to ensure that the institution of democracy is maintained by not being party to these shameless lies, bribes and other devices used by politicians to influence elections. This is my major grievance, for I entered parliament because of the love of my country and a desire to ensure that we could look forward to the future of our nation with a great degree of enthusiasm. To achieve such goals requires certain actions that require tough decisions to be made, irrespective of the political consequences, and it is unfortunate that many politicians do not have the political will to do that for our great country. So, until we are all prepared to speak and act according to what is right and not what is more politically favourable, we will never have a true democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on this occasion on behalf of my constituents Mr and Mrs Ken Cross and the growing numbers of parents across Australia who find themselves victims of the same circumstance, a circumstance that strikes without warning but leaves devastation in its wake. For Mr and Mrs Cross, this circumstance, this stealer of dreams, came in the form of a car crash. Their 24-year-old daughter, at the threshold of adult life, now suffers from a disability that afflicts a growing number of other young Australians. For other people, this stealer of dreams has struck on the sporting field, through asthma attacks, tumours, industrial accidents or simply falling off a bike.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This dream stealer and wrecker of families has a clinical name which, like all clinical names in our civilised world, tries to expunge emotion from the true meaning. But behind the name, behind the clinical condition, lies a growing number of Australian faces&mdash;faces that could easily be yours or mine or those of our children, faces full of emotion, faces that cry out for our help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Modern medicine has saved a lot of lives. No-one is disputing that fact. But with modern medicine comes a new conundrum: an obligation to help those patients that the modern miracle of medicine only half saves, or quarter saves, or barely saves. These people live in a shadow land of shifting realities, never to fully know or understand the certainty of their previous existence. Society, through governments, has a collective responsibility to assist these growing numbers of Australians, these modern Australians who have been struck down by a modern illness called acquired brain damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The brain is unique. If damaged, the brain, unlike most other organs of the body, cannot repair itself. In the short time since Mr and Mrs Cross came to see me concerning the plight of their daughter, I have been amazed at the growing extent of acquired brain damage in this country. It is eating away at our people, and their silent screams are not being heard. Now that I am attuned to the plight of ABD sufferers, hardly a week passes by without my hearing further stories of despair. Australia, at all levels of government, has a substantial policy vacuum in this area. This vacuum must be filled. The purpose of my speech today is to let colleagues on all sides of politics, in both the federal and state parliaments, know that we as the Australian law-makers must work together to improve the lot of acquired brain damage sufferers and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of example, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 9 October came the story of Angus Rigg, a 19-year-old who for two years has been in Melbourne's Prince Alfred Hospital suffering from acquired brain damage. Everyone agrees that Angus is not a suitable patient for the acute care hospital, but tragically there is nowhere else to go. He has been rescued from death by modern medicine only to live through a lifetime of policy neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many young long-term sufferers like Angus are eventually pushed out of these acute care hospitals to end up in totally unsuitable institutions, such as nursing homes for the aged. Commonsense dictates that young people lying in beds next to old people at the natural end of their life is inappropriate. The states, territories and Commonwealth have to make an immediate commitment to develop a proper care and support program for all people who suffer from acquired brain damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, this process has started already in this year's federal budget, with the announcement by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe) of the development of a national policy on acquired brain damage. But the challenge ahead of us is great. The stable door has been open for some time, and the horse is a speck of dust in the distance. In the game of catch-up ahead, the Commonwealth cannot work in isolation; it needs the commitment and cooperation of state and territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of Australians with acquired brain damage has been increasing steadily over recent years and there is no sign that this trend will diminish. It is estimated that nationally each year 27,000 people will incur traumatic brain damage, 24,000 will survive to be admitted to hospital, and 3,000 to 4,000 will be discharged from hospital with severe brain damage. The vast majority will be young adult males aged between 17 and 25. They will be young adults like Angus Rigg and like the daughter of my constituents, Mr and Mrs Cross. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As always, though, there are lone voices in the wilderness who have known about this problem long before it reached the ears of politicians. Headway is an organisation committed to the development of policies and programs which will enable people with acquired brain damage and their families to maintain a quality lifestyle. Brain damage groups now exist in all Australian states and have been strengthened by the national body, the Head Injury Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have up to 4,000 traumatic acquired brain damage cases per year in Australia, then the number of Australians suffering from non-traumatic acquired brain damage would be significantly more, but we do not know how much more. Hopefully, the $200,000, two-year research program put forward in this year's budget to gather information on ABD sufferers who require services will shed some light in this area. To date this kind of research into acquired brain damage has been sadly neglected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, Headway in Queensland published a study stating that people with non-traumatic acquired brain damage often said that they no longer `knew themselves', they did not `trust their brains' anymore, and they could not `rely' on themselves to make accurate judgments or perceive things correctly. They felt that their `most important piece of equipment' had been damaged and that they were now `only half human'. Society has abandoned these people to suffer silently, their anguish shared only by the anguish of their carers&mdash;usually their families&mdash;who feel deserted, cheated and lost. These are the people who need our help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When dealing with social problems, society tends to say, `Out of sight, out of mind'. Today I am saying to all of us, `In sight, in mind'. These people exist and they need our help. Unfortunately, the present reality appears to be that people affected by acquired brain damage cannot access appropriate human services. For a variety of reasons, this group of people are rarely accepted by current service providers or do not benefit from existing models of service provision&mdash;they fall between the cracks. It is our responsibility&mdash;state, territory and Commonwealth governments&mdash;to lift sufferers of acquired brain damage out of those cracks and to close those cracks forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Researchers in the past have estimated that throughout Australia there is one in 370 chances of incurring brain damage from car accidents alone. When one compares this with national figures regarding the chance of contracting, say the AIDS virus&mdash;one in 56,000&mdash;it becomes starkly obvious that brain damage is a much more immediate problem demanding of attention, or is certainly as important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I received a letter from Graham Rowe, the director of CASSI, the Coastal Accommodation Support Service Inc. on the Gold Coast, which is just outside my electorate. CASSI was established in 1989-90 under section 10 of the Commonwealth's Disability Services Act to provide accommodation and support services for persons who have severe, profound and/or multiple disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Mr Rowe has been experiencing success in the work of CASSI, he has come to the view that community based living as espoused by various state-Commonwealth disability service acts is neither practical nor appropriate for a significant number of people with quite severe and profound disabilities. Already he has a waiting list of nine young people with acquired brain damage who are inappropriately housed in aged persons nursing homes. This example is being replicated all around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His belief&mdash;I support him in this&mdash;is that there is a real and urgent need within the community for the provision of alternative accommodation options such as special nursing home-hostel style facilities specifically for younger people with severe and profound disabilities which should provide support and assistance on a 24-hour per day basis on a lifestyle rather than a medical model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many factors to be considered in costing the effects of ABD. In figures that Dr John Watson, Director of the Neuropsychology Unit at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in New South Wales, supplied to me, he extrapolates that even if there were only 2,000 new cases of traumatic acquired brain damage annually in Australia one would be looking at a bill of at least $200 million per year for this group of new cases alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other health experts estimate 4,000 new traumatic ABD cases in Australia per year, which would bring that to a cost of $400 million. This does not include old cases and does not include non-traumatic ABD cases. These costings are very conservative and are growing. Ten years ago in the USA figures for traumatic ABD-only suggest an annual sum of $14 billion. There are no current figures for that country, but the bill must be immense. We have not reached crisis point, but we do not want to reach that crisis point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is clear that ABD is a problem that affects the Australian community to a numerical and financial extent way beyond general expectations. Several things need to be done. Firstly, relatively simple research is needed to estimate incidence, prevalence, age distribution, life expectancy and severity of condition of those suffering from this syndrome. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services has made a good start in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, assistance has to be given to ABD victims who have no access to compensation through the normal legal process. Thirdly, special nursing home-hostel style facilities, specifically for younger people with severe ABD, should be provided on a 24-hour lifestyle rather than medical model. And, lastly, this issue needs to be put on the agenda at the next meeting of Commonwealth, state and territory governments as a matter of urgency and a proper strategy developed to deal cooperatively and effectively with this growing problem. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As this will be the last opportunity for me to speak in this parliament before Christmas, I wish that I could say that we are approaching a Christmas season and a new year after a year in which we as a nation have made great progress. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and I believe that 1994 will probably be one of the most testing and challenging years for all of us in Australia, particularly for those of us involved in the federal parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week we have heard a lot of discussion about unemployment, and that is appropriate because it is a major problem for us to address. We all know that in the last two years Australia's unemployment rate has remained consistently above 10 per cent and that this represents the most sustained period of high unemployment ever experienced in Australia since the Great Depression in 1929-33. Long-term unemployment is also at an all-time high with over a third of the unemployed having not had a job for more than a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we discuss problems like long-term unemployment with our constituents, it appears we are getting a consistent thread of comment from people that, in their view, those who are trying to sustain themselves and their families, those who are working in their own small businesses and on farms and generally doing what they can to be self-sufficient, are increasingly finding less incentive for them to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is proven by the fact that Australia's rate of private sector investment has been at the lowest level since we started to record these rates. That is a consistent trend and a very worrying one. Of course, we have the increasing overseas debt and the problems of the social consequences of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment. There are the tragic consequences to the individual, the loss of self-esteem, and some of us, unfortunately, have had the experience of knowing young people who have actually taken their lives. They have done this, probably, partly because of the boredom and the loss of confidence that they have endured and which has developed as a result of long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received a letter recently from a doctor in my electorate, and I will put parts of it on the record because it gives an interesting insight into some of the problems that we have. The doctor actually wrote to the Prime Minister, I understand, to complain in the strongest possible terms about the government's unemployment and welfare policies. He said in his letter that one of his patients, a sole parent with two children, had recently given up a job in the hospitality industry `because she could not afford to work'. What a remarkable statement!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went on to say that her current pension, on having got out of the workplace, amounts to $430 per fortnight. He said that, whilst she was working, she received $640 per fortnight, which was more than the pension. However, her rent increased by $126 per fortnight, and day care for her children increased by $150 per fortnight: a total increase of $276 in outgoings per fortnight. This was as a result of her earning income greater than the pension. Her disposable income was thus reduced to $364 per fortnight. In other words, by going to work and suffering the penalty of increased rent and child-care costs, she was actually $32 per week worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That patient has given up work now and is being supported by the taxpayer. Meanwhile, the doctor is left to cope and to treat her, to try to bolster her self-esteem and provide support, as her doctor. What a remarkable letter it is! It raises some questions. How could it be that someone could exit from the workplace and receive a pension? Obviously, we know the way the system works. There has to be a period of time between exiting the workplace and becoming entitled to unemployment payments or a pension. I presume that in this case all of those periods expired. What an indictment it is to think that here is a woman who has two children and believes that she is better off not working! I do not say that she is right. I do not know enough about her case to be able to be an expert on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She is at home with her kids, of course. The Parliamentary Secretary makes a very valid point, and it is certainly worth recognising. I have used the example given to me by the somewhat frazzled general practitioner to highlight one of the symptoms that we have in our country. There is a culture rapidly developing here of people saying that it is no longer worth it to keep on hanging in and trying to work, because the contrast between what they get and then have to pay out, and what others get who do nothing and who do not work is such that it is better to fall back into the no work syndrome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel very sorry for those human beings who have come to that conclusion. It is terrible to think that people would write themselves off in that way. Certainly, the observations that one picks up from constituents&mdash;I earlier mentioned the people struggling to stay in small business despite difficult times&mdash;indicate their increasing bitterness at the way society is developing; and they mention examples like this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in getting, and looked forward to reading, the green paper statement because of the build-up that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has given it. I know that the debate is not over; it is just beginning. But I have to say that I believe the statement lacked an appropriate response&mdash;an emphasis on the effect on actual unemployment or employment outcomes of the labour market rigidities and the central wage fixing systems that we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also feel that the paper failed to address the fact that we have a system where the ACTU, because of its unusually high dominance over the government&mdash;and it has been so because we have had a federal Labor government for more than 10 years now&mdash;is in a position of extraordinary power. It is that influence and presence that maintain some of the rigidities in the wage fixing, industrial relations and labour market areas. It does not matter which side of politics honourable members are on, those who understand how an economy works would have to concede that one of the most effective and long-term ways of helping the nation and helping the unemployed to get work is to develop the economy and expand markets, sales and investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another anomaly I find is shown in the experience of a young university student who told me that he had applied for a part-time vacation job in a large retail outlet. He had all the qualifications and enthusiasm and wanted to earn a few dollars so he could be a bit more independent of his parents and achieve some goals by purchasing something that he had wanted to buy for a long time. He passed all his interviews with the retailer and was given a good mark there, but he did not get the job. The people who were employed by the retailer were the long-term unemployed for whom the retailer was able to obtain government assistance and subsidies towards their wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one, including this young student, would begrudge the young long-term unemployed their opportunity to obtain work and experience. But I raise the case because, unwittingly&mdash;and I see the green paper doing the same&mdash;we are making things worse by putting a position to young Australians where we are virtually saying, `Do you know that these training schemes and these opportunities to get into subsidised employment opportunities with employers in Australia are available only if you are long-term unemployed?'. So the danger of this sort of program is that you are telling young Australians that they cannot get work unless they have first been in long-term unemployment.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 September 1993 Mr John Elliott, through his solicitor, Mr Aarons, caused letters to be sent to the police minister of the state of Victoria, Mr Pat McNamara, and to the Attorney-General of the state of Victoria, Mrs Jan Wade, requesting them to intervene in the laying of charges by the Director of Public Prosecutions against Mr Elliott. On 28 September 1993, further letters were forwarded to Mr Pat McNamara effectively seeking an inquiry which would result in the dismissal or the suspension of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Bernard Bongiorno.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortly after the receipt of those letters, on or about 5 October 1993, secret meetings commenced between the Attorney-General, Mrs Jan Wade, Mr Greg Craven and an obscure junior prosecutor from the Department of Public Prosecutions, Nick Papas. The purpose of these meetings was to draft legislation which would effectively remove the independence of Mr Bongiorno and allow the Attorney-General to intervene in the affairs of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The draft bill is intended to castrate the office and to ensure that the independence of an important public authority, the Director of Public Prosecutions, is removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been involved in the secret discussions and negotiations leading to the draft of the legislation, Mr Nick Papas was appointed by Mrs Wade as Chief Magistrate of the state of Victoria on 24 November 1993. Why was Mr Nick Papas selected by Mrs Wade to be involved in the drafting of legislation which would diminish the responsibility and the independence of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions? As a person employed as a member of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, why would Mr Nick Papas attend secret meetings without informing his employer? As a crown prosecutor, why would Mr Papas allow himself to become involved in actions which would diminish his own independence as a crown prosecutor&mdash;an independence he obviously does not value?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why was Mr Nick Papas, on 24 November 1993, at the age of 35, appointed to the position of Chief Magistrate of the state of Victoria when there are more experienced and more senior members available and when he had had no experience in judicial management? The position is that an obscure, junior prosecutor in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions entered into secret meetings and negotiations with Mr Greg Craven and Mrs Jan Wade to draft legislation which would diminish the power and the independence of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and did so without informing his employer. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many stories circulating in Victoria that Mr Papas is related by marriage to Mr Petro Georgiou, National Secretary of the Liberal Party of Australia, and to a prominent Victorian Liberal Party member, Mr Ian Carsons. The only way these rumours can be put to rest is by some very frank and very open disclosures by Mr Papas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Papas has also had secret meetings with the Premier of Victoria, Mr Jeff Kennett, and has been promised further promotion within the judicial system of the state of Victoria.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even worse is the fact that the sequence of events leads one to a conclusion that it is possible that all of these events have followed the intervention of the solicitors for Mr Elliott with Mrs Wade and Mr Pat McNamara. What price and what value do Mr Kennett and Mrs Wade place on the independence of the judiciary of the state of Victoria, and on the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Victoria?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General of Victoria does not deserve to hold the position she now does. She stands as the chief law officer of the state of Victoria. By her actions she has subverted everything the position demands of her.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the stench of corruption in Queensland, the Fitzgerald report made strong recommendations as to the independence of the judiciary and of the Director of Public Prosecutions. One would have assumed that the lessons of Bjelke-Petersen's Queensland would have been learnt by all politicians in Australia. In Victoria it is obvious that those lessons have not only not been learnt, but the Fitzgerald report has been used in a reverse way. The state government of Victoria is in fact doing the opposite of all of the recommendations of the Fitzgerald inquiry. The once proud Liberal Party of Australia has now been exposed as corrupt.

The prosecutorial system must be removed from partisan political interference. The Public Prosecution Bill does the opposite. Its enactment should be opposed by all who support democracy.</PARA>
<PARA>It is of enormous alarm to all people who support democracy. How can a government which purports to hold dear those things which are fundamental to democratic process compromise the separation of the executive arm of government from the prosecution system of a state? Mr Kennett has to explain and Mrs Wade has to explain why Mr Papas was appointed, when there was no reason to take an obscure 35-year-old junior prosecutor with no judicial experience and put him in as the Chief Magistrate of the state of Victoria.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a small town in my electorate, Moura, a mining town, a young private was home on leave from the army. In keeping with the best traditions of doing the right thing, he sought to apply for a civilian driver's licence. He went in and said that he had the army licence, could he have a civilian licence? `No, couldn't do that, you would have to get a learner's permit'. Between when he got the learner's permit and could come back for another test, the permit had expired. He returned to Moura seeking a second learner's permit. Finally, he was given a test. When he had completed the test, he was failed on the basis that the tester did not like the way he braked and did not like the way he looked into the rear vision mirrors at the side of the car. This was perpetrated on a young man who had been in the army for 2 1/2 years, had been in transport for nearly two years driving an extensive range of vehicles from troop carriers to explosives vehicles, and was a very respected driver.

So he returned to the Department of Transport in Bundaberg, and requested that it seek the registration confirmation. The clerk said, `No, we cannot do that. We are not in the business of sending faxes'. So there he was in no-man's-land. He came to me in desperation, saying that he could not get satisfaction from two state agencies. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another town in my electorate there was an issue of so-called privacy. A farmer, who was going through very tough times during the drought and who was driving a motorcycle as his main off-farm vehicle, parked outside the Department of Social Security. A client in a four-wheel-drive vehicle parked in front of him, transacted his business inside the DSS, got into the four-wheel-drive vehicle and promptly backed over the motorcycle and took off without reporting the incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmer returned to find $2,000 worth of damage and no witnesses except the DSS staff. They refused to identify the alleged offender. The police were called and the staff member was counselled not to give the name. The police were frustrated in the execution of their duties and a complaint went to the regional superior of the DSS. From there it went to the Secretary of the Department of Social Security in Canberra. In the meantime, heaven knows where the alleged wrecker went to, and the strapped farmer added another $2,000 to his debt profile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would have been the position if the four-wheel-drive vehicle had actually backed over the driver sitting on the cycle and killed or maimed him?

Surely, when a person leaves the Department of Social Security office, steps onto the footpath and becomes a citizen again, he cannot hide behind the privacy provisions of the DSS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be like the case of a priest giving someone absolution in confession for a particular crime. If the person then went out onto the street, and the priest was standing on the steps of the church and saw that person pull out a gun and shoot someone, the priest would not be held by the seal of confession in that instance. That would be a totally separate incident that occurred outside the confessional. In the same way, why would the Department of Social Security impose such a tortuous interpretation of privacy and confidentiality?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When laws and bureaucratic practices are such that they become so convoluted as to negate the very purpose for which they were intended, then they are a farce. The practice is not clever. It is not reformist. It is not accountable. It is certainly not quality assured.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Petrie-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP> (1.15 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to begin debate on the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Restoring full employment </EMPHASIS>that was given to the government yesterday by the Committee on Employment Opportunities. I think this will be great meal for considerable debate in the wider community on a solution for especially long-term unemployed to re-enter the work force. I was particularly pleased that the concept of the parenting allowance has been recognised in this report. There are significant recommendations on the issue of a parenting allowance. I would like to traverse this debate because it is an issue I have been pursuing for some time now. In January of this year, I circulated a discussion paper to all honourable members of the government on this question. In that proposal, I suggested that there be financial assistance to the parent, in a two-parent family, who stayed at home and cared for children under preschool age.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective of the proposal that I was circulating in January was to give parents, or a parent, a choice, so that it was financially viable for them not to enter the work force and to care for a child or children at home. Let me stress that there is nothing wrong with either parent staying at home to care for young children. The parents need to be given a choice of either going to work or staying at home to care for their children. As long as there is no compulsion, this idea is not a challenge to anyone's right to be part of the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a conversation on the weekend with a very experienced manager of the preschool centre where my daughter is. It is a very respected centre; I will not give the details. That woman was suggesting to me that there is a case to be made out for the fact that very young children are subject to an easy transmission of disease, even in the highest quality child-care centre. As we all know, they can get ill pretty quickly. I get phone calls to my electorate office from time to time to duck into town and pick up my daughter&mdash;that is, if my wife is unavailable. This fact needs to be recognised. No matter what the quality of the child-care centre, these diseases can circulate very quickly, as all parents would know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing is that, patently, there is stress on parents when both are working with a child, or children, in a child-care centre. This is not to turn the whole debate on its head. It is simply to recognise that there is a large proportion of parents who are both working and who put a child in a child-care centre, especially when the child is very young. We have some figures on this. These parents are suggesting that they would like an alternative; they would like to be able to pull out of work. They feel as though they are working because they need the income for whatever purposes. That is their business. This report is beginning to recognise that part of the debate. As far as I understand it, and I need to study it some more, we are trying to make sure that, in our social security system, there are no disincentives to making the choice to stay at home and look after the child. In January, I was not suggesting a direct payment to the parent staying at home; I had the freedom and luxury of not having to cost all of my proposals. Of course, these proposals have to be costed and have to be affordable. I will now outline some of the detail of the parenting allowance proposal in the green paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in employment of married women and the changes in the employment opportunities for both men and women suggest that income support payments should be structured more flexibly to support a wider choice for parents balancing work and family responsibilities. The nature of the social security system, including its benefits and targeting of payments, can potentially constrain the choice of parents balancing work and family responsibilities. Under the proposed change to move away from a joint incomes test for married couples to an incomes test primarily on individual incomes, a new parenting allowance could be provided for those caring full-time for children. This allowance would need to be paid to spouses of people in low paid jobs to maintain their incentive to take full-time jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social security arrangements are at odds with modern labour market realities. More than half of all married women are now participating in the labour market compared with just nine per cent of married women aged 20 to 54 in 1947. Of some concern is that wives of unemployed men have a significantly lower labour force participation rate, 41 per cent, and a higher unemployment rate, 45 per cent, than do the wives of employed men, which are 68 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This idea is really a continuation of something that we announced last year. The home child-care allowance is to be introduced in September 1994. Under that, the spouses of the unemployed will receive half the current newstart married rate payment through a new payment called the partner allowance. This will provide some income support directly to the spouse in recognition of his or her contribution to the household. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income test has been modified. There is now more incentive for the spouse of an unemployed person to take more part-time work. There may be a case for facilitating the withdrawal from the labour force of those who would prefer to care for their children full time. This debate revolves around the issue of the importance to married women of being able to choose either to care for their children full time or to undertake employment, and whether there are incentives or disincentives in our payment system which skew their choice. It is important that we get out of the way of those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present there are conflicting incentives for married women to undertake employment. Support is needed for a wider choice for parents balancing work and family responsibilities. More support and recognition is needed for parents' choices, including for those parents who care for their children full time. To summarise, the parenting allowance would be for couples where the breadwinner was unemployed and the spouse was caring full time for children aged below 16&mdash;or possibly 12. A parenting allowance would be available to the non-job seeking partner instead. The maximum payment would be the same as the dole for spouses seeking work, which is $131.85 per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we have gone some way down the track in the debate about who participates in the work force, under what constraints they have to participate, and how there should be assistance for those who wish to place their children in child care, but now we have to be sure that payments that are available through the social security system do not act as a disincentive for those parents who prefer to stay at home in a full-time capacity to look after their children. We have reached a stage in this debate whereby people on both sides of the argument should feel relaxed about the concept of a parenting allowance. As I said, a very experienced woman who has managed a public sector child-care centre for many years agreed that we need to recognise the stresses on the two-parenting, two-working family where they have to place a child in care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to be aware of the unavoidable consequences of having very young children grouped together in care, no matter what precautions are taken, whereby those children readily share and swap diseases. We all know that this occurs. So in the next few months we should have a very intelligent debate about balancing the need to work with the need for parents to stay at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I have a Christmas message for everyone, as I do not think I will be speaking again before Christmas. I give my best wishes to the good people who work in this House and who help us all throughout the year. I also wish my colleagues all the very best for Christmas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak this afternoon on some of the wider implications of the Native Title Bill, debate on which was guillotined in this place by a government which was desperate to avoid any detailed examination of the issues. It is a bad piece of legislation which is unjust and unworkable. The attempt to implement it will not advance the cause of most Aboriginal people, but it will damage the interests of all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to address one issue which is raised by this legislation and which has been raised explicitly by some of its supporters&mdash;Aboriginal self-determination. The language of self-determination has now become widespread, but most Australians are probably, as yet, unaware of the nature of this discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July this year Emeritus Professor Russell Mathews presented a paper to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, CEDA, entitled `Towards Aboriginal Self-government'. Professor Mathews's paper called for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An immediate start to negotiations aimed at establishing self-government in the Aboriginal lands of the Northern Territory as the first step in true reconciliation with the Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA>The contribution of the government's bill to this objective may at first glance seem to be slight, but it is to be seen in several provisions which go far beyond the High Court judgment and which have the potential to lay the basis for a new territory of the Commonwealth based on race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions to which I refer are, firstly, those which treat native title as equivalent in key respects to freehold. The government has made no secret of its intention to give native title its maximum scope. It is quite clear that it has been prepared to go far beyond the High Court decision to give effect to this goal. The government consistently refers to native title land, even though it is quite plain from the High Court judgment and from historical facts that in many cases&mdash;perhaps the majority of cases on the Australian mainland&mdash;native title rights are much more equivalent to rights of usage or entitlement to the fruits of the land than they are to freehold title over the land. In this matter, the legislation introduced by Premier Court in Western Australia, with its confirmation of the existing rights of all Aboriginal people and their conversion to enforceable statutory rights, is much closer to both the reality and to the spirit of the High Court judgment than the federal bill which is now before the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second feature of the bill in this context, a feature which also goes well beyond the High Court decision, is the provision that</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal holders of pastoral leases will be able to convert their lease to native title, if they could otherwise have claimed native title in relation to the land but for the existence of the pastoral lease. The way in which this provision is likely to work must be seen in the light of a further provision of the government's bill: the creation of a land fund for the purchase of land for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little doubt that one of the applications of this land fund will be to buy up pastoral properties for Aboriginal people, who will then be able to convert the title to these properties into native title land under the legislation. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron, has stated his view that the consequence of this is that as much as 90 per cent of the Northern Territory is likely to fall under Aboriginal title of one kind or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No Australian should be under any illusion that such a move will give a huge push forward to a separatist agenda. Professor Mathews, as I have said, believes that the establishment of self-government in the Aboriginal lands of the Northern Territory should be a first step to what he calls true reconciliation with the Aboriginal people. In building his case, Professor Mathews points to the example of Canada, where two distinct systems of indigenous self-government have emerged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to anyone who thinks that Canada does not provide a realistic analogy for Australia, Professor Mathews does not agree. On the contrary, he believes that Australia provides a much more favourable case for Aboriginal self-government than Canada. His main argument is that Aboriginal land ownership has proceeded much further in this country than it has in Canada. In addition, what are in essence political structures, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and the land councils, have already been set in place and these structures could relatively easily be converted into the framework for Aboriginal self-government. Thirdly, Australian expenditure on Aboriginal services per capita already exceeds that level in Canada, and Professor Mathews believes that a consolidation of these funds could already be used to provide a substantial initial revenue base for a self-governing Aboriginal territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in Professor Mathews's view, the Grants Commission in Australia presides over a system of fiscal equalisation which is much more highly developed than any which exists in Canada, and the Grants Commission would be able to readily advise the Commonwealth on the level of funds a new self-governing territory would need. Professor Mathews argues that negotiations should be commenced to divide the Northern Territory into two parts, `one of which would be the self-governing territory comprising the Aboriginal lands excised from the existing Territory'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken the time to spell out the Mathews proposal because it clearly shows that the separatist agenda is not just one which is promoted by a few extremists; it is an agenda which, though most people are as yet not aware, is getting an increasingly wide hearing in certain circles. I have no doubt at all that, within a relatively short time of the passage of the Native Title Bill, the creation of at least one and possibly more separate Aboriginal territories will be a new focus of attention among the chattering classes and that it will be actively promoted by some Aboriginal leaders, who today are talking more circumspectly so as not to imperil the passage of the bill through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the Mathews proposal is totally unacceptable. It is deeply flawed on grounds of fundamental principle: it contradicts and sweeps away the basic principles and ideals on which this nation is founded. Canada, a nation which tragically seems to be in a state of disintegration, should not be taken as an example we should follow, but as a case we should avoid at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental flaw of the Mathews proposal, and of all proposals for a distinct self-governing Aboriginal territory, is that it argues for a political structure based on race. Such a self-governing territory would inevitably raise a host of questions, the answers to which would inevitably be determined by their implications for the racial composition and viability of the new territory. If there were not racially based laws in such a territory, it is highly probable that, over time, the very basis for the establishment of such a territory would be undermined because of the relatively small numbers of the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inevitable political conflict would be generated as the Aboriginal inhabitants of the territory fought to maintain their hold on its affairs. If it looked as though the battle to maintain the territory as an Aboriginal territory were being lost, it is certain that there would be growing demands for its independence from Australia, as has occurred in Quebec in Canada. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The path down which Australia would be going under such proposals would lead inexorably to the break-up of the Commonwealth of Australia. The great ideal of one people one destiny, which motivated the federation of the colonies, would be thrown into the garbage can of history. There is no room for racial discrimination as a standing principle of public policy in Australia. Australia is a democracy, and a fundamental principle of democracy is that all people are equal before the law. Our institutions and our political structures should be such that all Australians can participate in them equally, without regard to their race or ethnic background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this critical moment in our national development, we must be exceedingly careful that in our deep determination to address the issue of disadvantage for Aboriginal and other Australians we do not set in place policies and structures based on principles and concepts which are incompatible with the basic ideal of equality of all people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not often that I have to come into the House and say that I have made a mistake. However, in a speech some time ago I am afraid I did that. I claimed that the Premier of Victoria's name was Jeffrey Gibb Kennett. I am sorry, but I have found out it is Jeffrey `Glib' Kennett. When you have a look at the definition of `glib', it means fluent and voluble but insincere and shallow, and those meanings point directly to what this man is like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would also like to inform the House about something that I have heard of just recently. This is a secret letter that has been sent to the Premier of Victoria, Jeffrey `Glib' Kennett, from the Russian leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Vladimir has requested from Jeff details as to how he has created a fascist state in just 12 months. Vladimir is definitely after these details, and I will go on to describe what has happened in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vladimir, of course, saw it on TV just recently through the actions of the police in Victoria in relation to Richmond secondary college. Millions of other people all over the world also saw the terrible television shots of what happened in Victoria. There was a line of policemen with their batons in the straight, horizontal position. I only saw it on TV, like everyone else, but they appeared to be saying, `Move, move, move'. They were all chanting in unison and had a very threatening manner. What they were doing was trying to shift on innocent civilians who were trying to protect the school for their children, and these innocent civilians did not have any protection. They were in the crouch position and continually the police just went straight at them with their batons. Many of these unprotected civilians were severely hurt. All the time there was the line of police chanting, `Move, move, move'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members think about where the police would have got this word from, they might recall a document which may have cost anywhere from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, and which was prepared by the Premier and the state government of Victoria and delivered to every household there, I believe. On the front is a smiling Jeff Kennett, Premier of Victoria, and at the bottom is the new motto for the Liberal Party in Victoria: `Victoria on the move'. How right he is! Not only are people moving from Victoria to Queensland but they are also getting a baton in the ribs and being told to move on if they sit down and protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard today from the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) in relation to what is happening in our judicial system. I am not a lawyer, but even someone with my limited knowledge of the law realises that there should not be any political interference, especially with the Department of Public Prosecutions. The prosecutor is no friend of the Labor Party. I know that in the past there have been problems with him in Victoria, but he is independent. This position is now under threat. If the honourable member for McEwen's allegations are correct&mdash;as I believe many of them will prove to be&mdash;we will see some serious fallout in the Liberal Party in relation to these attempts to put pressure on the legal and judicial system in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also bring to the attention of the House and the people of Australia the change in police powers that is happening in Victoria. This is a very serious matter. Under a redrafted bill of the Kennett Liberal government, police who suspect&mdash;and please note the word `suspect'&mdash;a person of committing a crime could force people to provide their name and address, and failure to do so would result in a $500 fine. Police would have the power to fingerprint people of over 15 years of age in a videotaped procedure and to fingerprint children&mdash;note that this applies only to suspected people&mdash;aged between 10 and 14, on the condition that their parents were aware that it was being done. What happens to all the homeless kids when parents cannot be found? Are they fingerprinted too?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, police would be empowered to forensically test people if the person had given consent. If the person fails to consent&mdash;note the words `fails to consent'&mdash;a court order can be required for the testing procedure. Even the Victorian branch of the Australian Medical Association has complained. It complained that doctors could not be forced to take body samples without the person's consent. However, Mrs Wade, the Attorney-General of such notoriety, has said that doctors would not be forced to take body samples and that a provision was being included for a person's own doctor to take the sample or be present while it was being taken. Mrs Wade acknowledged that forensic provisions were not available elsewhere in Australia. This is another reason why Victoria is becoming the fascist state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other matters in relation to this particular problem that I see happening in Victoria. I know that when the revolution comes I will probably be the first up against the wall, but I think it is my duty to point out to this country the problems in Victoria. I have mentioned the fascist state and honourable members only have to look at headlines such as `Kennett "gagging debate with jackboot tactics"'. If that does not come out of the Nazi era, I do not know what does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that has to be done when a fascist state is created is to have a go at the papers, the TV, the radio and, of course, the law and the church. Jeffrey has done all that. The Premier of Victoria has put a ban on talking to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. He will not talk to the ABC nor will he talk to the Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. All such media are banned, although the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> is still on the popular list for the moment. I do not know how long that will last: it will probably go. So I imagine that we will be getting more and more of these productions paid for by the Victorian taxpayer and sent to every home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, in my local newspaper, there was a four-page colour wraparound which was a propaganda sheet paid for by the Victorian government. It went to everyone in Dunkley and everyone in the Frankston and Mornington areas. It probably went all over Victoria. Who funded that? According to the write-up inside, it was funded by the advertisers and the Victorian government. The advertisers were bodies such as the SEC, the state government, and so on. It is a real con job. It is all part of the softening-up process so that Jeffrey can completely impose his will on the people of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are a few of us on whom it will not work. Honourable members are looking at one of them right now. I will keep complaining about this person until he acknowledges what he is doing. Honourable members probably remember his wine licence. He was never charged over that. Things got lost and forgotten about. It was back in October. Who can remember what happened in October?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The controversial liquor licence which was granted to Jeff Kennett was the only one of its kind not approved by the police. Liquor licensing commissioner Tony Ryan said that of 30,000 to 40,000 limited licences, Mr Kennett's was probably the only one not inspected by the police. Of 30,000 to 40,000 licences, who does not get a guernsey? Jeffrey `Glib' Kennett of course! It is quite amazing. I wonder whether I am getting a bit paranoid but when I look at what he is trying to do there I see that the only area that was not cut in budget allocations was the police force. Normally, a dictator looks after the army. The army does not come under Jeffrey's control as yet. So I am a bit concerned about what is happening down there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I believe that what he is doing in Victoria is completely wrong. Everyone in this House should take note of it. They should remember this. Honourable members may treat what I am saying as a joke now, but if they look back on it in a couple of years, if he is still in power, they should remember that I told them to be wary of this particular person. He is doing something to Victoria that no other premier would do, and even Joh Bjelke-Petersen would not have been as blatant as this particular guy&mdash;or maybe he could have been. I urge everyone to be extremely careful and very wary of Jeffrey `Glib' Kennett. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a statement about the manipulation of petrol prices that is taking place in this country. Overnight, in my own electorate, petrol prices increased by approximately 10c per litre. It is a predictable outcome, because what we find is that petrol prices are increasing on the evening prior to the day that payment of a large majority of social service welfare payments is made, as well as wages and salaries of Commonwealth and state public servants. The oil companies are providing discount incentives to local service stations only during the low volume days within a week or a fortnightly cycle. They are well aware of when people get paid and when sales at the pump are at their highest. On these days, prices per litre at service stations peak.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to report to the House that the Uruguay Round was concluded with the gaveling of the final act by the trade negotiating committee chairman earlier this morning our time. Final market access schedules are to be submitted by 15 February next year, prior to the final meeting of the ministerial committee of the trade negotiating committee in Marrakesh in April 1994. This has been a long, difficult and very rewarding negotiation. It is the largest international negotiation of its kind and the largest world trade deal ever by a huge margin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity to extend Australia's thanks to the many ministers, officials and business people who have contributed to its successful conclusion. I would like to particularly recognise the early work of the current Treasurer, who formed the Cairns Group in 1986, and the subsequent and very brilliant work of the subsequent ministers for trade: the honourable member for Holt; the honourable member for Bonython, who just asked me the question; the honourable member for Werriwa; and, of course, now Senator Cook. The former ministers carried on the trade work and negotiations in the most gruelling and darkest hours of the round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we are all indebted to the great work that Senator Cook has done in Geneva, tying up loose ends and winning last minute gains for Australia. I spoke to Senator Cook and his team of officials in Geneva this morning and congratulated them, on the government's behalf, for the very fine achievements which will greatly enhance the prosperity and welfare of the round for fellow Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should record the faith the government has shown in the multilateral trading system and our belief in such a system serving not just Australia and the world well, but imagining an international trading world where there could be a higher level of growth and a higher level of incomes. This is very much in accord with the model that this government has set for Australia from the early 1980s onwards&mdash;in removing exchange controls in the early 1980s, in lowering border protection from 1988 on a phased basis to 1991, and then of course announcing further reductions in tariffs going way down to the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That open, competitive model, which it took a Labor government to put into place in this country, was complemented by the structures we built for Australia internationally. The Treasurer built these first as Minister for Trade with the Cairns Group in 1986. We then supported them by a succession of ministers and efforts to build the possibility the Uruguay Round had for extending the Kennedy Round from goods, into things such as services, intellectual property rights and, particularly for Australia, agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a very difficult round and, for a second, I fleetingly mention the role of ministers and the darkest hours of the round. This was the hardest, most gruelling negotiation that Australia has ever been part of: days and nights fighting over words, fighting over sentences, fighting over communiques, pressuring people in corridors&mdash;all the things which the ministers I mentioned did to achieve this outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, Australia has played a very substantial role in our leadership of the Cairns Group and, as well as that, in the negotiation with the European Union and the United States. The consequence is a deal which will now set a backdrop in world trade as the world community moves to a new phase of commerce with these great societies rejoining the world economy&mdash;in the case of Russia, for the first time since the First World War; in the case of China, substantially, in this modern environment, for the first time ever; and with India, another major state, now emerging as a major player in the world of commerce and trade. What better backdrop could there be for this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate President Clinton on pressing for a conclusion of the round and pressing his ministers to have the round concluded. This follows his success in running the threads of open trade through the United States with the endorsement by the congress of the North American Free Trade Agreement and his involvement with the continuing development of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation&mdash;APEC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very different world today from yesterday as a consequence of this happening. It means that we will now see great opportunities for growth in trade. For Australia, the Industry Commission suggests that the benefits may be as much as a $5 billion increase in exports and a $3.7 billion increase in Australian GDP as a result of the round. That model does not capture all of the dynamic and confidence effects which would obviously come from this kind of change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, it does point to a minimum increase of over $2 billion in our manufactured exports and a $2 billion increase in resource exports, as well as a $1 billion increase in agricultural exports. According to the Industry Commission, the transport industry could see exports rise by well over $200 million, with the same for machinery and the equipment industry. ABARE tells us that the wheat industry may see its export returns rise by over $250 million. The meat industry could see returns rise by over $400 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are fairly spectacular changes. It might be worth mentioning that there will be 50 million tonnes less subsidised wheat and flour on the world market over the six-year implementation period compared with now. United States and European union subsidised wheat exports are likely to be down one-third by the year 2000 on current levels. But, as everybody expected those subsidies to continue, it will be down about half of what everyone expected it might have been by the year 2000. This is quite a spectacular outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could I just recap by saying that what has happened here is, in multilateral terms, the most significant trade agreement ever struck. It was struck because of the persistence of countries in not letting largely European intransigence hold this up, of the support that we were able to garner with countries like the United States through the Cairns group, but always with a vision that this government had of an open multilateral trading system and seeing Australia have a role in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Communities elect governments to govern, and they elect governments to think about their future and their role in the world. This government has thought about Australia and designed an economy for it that fits into its view and its vision of an open multilateral trading system. Seeing this come around last evening was in fact very much the coming into evidence of the kind of economic framework which the Australian economy is now set up to be, and the international framework it is set up to participate in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could I again reiterate my congratulations and thanks to Senator Cook and to all those officials who have taken a key role in the round&mdash;and there are many of them; some current and some now retired&mdash;and to the members of this House that I mentioned: the Treasurer, the honourable member for Holt, the honourable member for Bonython and the honourable member for Werriwa. Australia owes them a great debt of gratitude, and I acknowledge that on behalf of the parliament.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. Let me join with the Prime Minister in congratulating all of those on this side of the House who have been responsible for steering this very significant outcome, and for what the Prime Minister has identified as very good news for the Australian economy. The deal that has been struck in the GATT round is particularly good news for our agricultural and mining sector. The farm sector, which has been long plagued by corrupt and subsidised world markets, which have led to depressions of the prices that they have got and restrictions on access, has been a significant beneficiary of this outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome establishes the discipline, the ground rules, for reform in the world marketplaces, that will lead to much freer markets as a result. The Prime Minister has indicated that for agriculture the gains are in excess of $1 billion; for the beef industry, on ABARE's analysis, the gains are up to $480 million when fully implemented; for dairy products, $170 million; for wheat, $250 million; and for coarse grains, in addition to that, some $60 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this decision when it starts to flow in concrete terms from 1995 will mean that there will no longer be a meat import law or section 22 quotas in the US for Australian beef and that the European Union and the US will be exporting substantially less subsidised wheat into world marketplaces. There will no longer be bans on rice imports in Japan and Korea and, importantly, what we have also been able to secure is that the US will not use its EEP program to subsidise rice sales into those markets. On top of that, we have secured the retention of the Andreissen assurance which will protect Australian beef markets in Asia from subsidised European beef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has indicated that the gains for the mining industry are up to $2 billion. Coal in particular will be a significant beneficiary standing to gain half a billion dollars and upwards from this outcome. In addition to that, there are opportunities for the value adding industries that the farm sector and the mining sector will develop. They can get a significant slice of the extra benefits that are available in terms of manufactured produce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of our export profiles, it is true that as a nation we have been moving from the quarry and the farm, but the reality is that much of that movement in future will be based on the quarry and the farm. I mention in particular the strategies that this government has in place for the food processing industries and for the fibre based industries. The opportunity for the commodity based groups to interact into this new direction, this new set of guidelines, is significant, as it will be for regional parts of Australia in terms of identifying their opportunities. I made reference to this yesterday in answer to a question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is essentially where the challenge now lies: the preparedness on the part of commercial interests to get behind this new set of guidelines and push for a larger slice of the action so that we are not just resting on the laurels of what has been achieved to date but getting a bigger share of that $400 billion market that will be freed up as a result of the GATT outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been very interested to note today that there has been hardly anything said by the opposition in relation to this historic outcome. The Leader of the National Party, who is always so quick to put out press releases whenever it suits him&mdash;it amazes me at times how quickly he gets them out&mdash;said on 3 December 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australia's leadership of the Cairns Group will be assessed in terms of the ultimate beneficiaries of the final Uruguay outcome.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that Australia could not be sidelined in the lead-up to the finalisation and that, if it was, `Australia's leadership must be held to account'. Not only have we not been sidelined, not only did we not go backwards; we in fact made improvements. Where is the opposition's response welcoming this outcome and congratulating the Australian leadership for what has been achieved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, today we have on the agenda for the first time in this sitting a matter of public importance relating to the rural economy. But what is it about? It is about AQIS. On the day on which we have had the most historic and significant breakthrough for our agricultural commodities and the rural sector, all the coalition can talk about in terms of a matter of importance is AQIS. The opposition is irrelevant, it is out of touch, it has lost the plot, and it is no wonder the rural sector is moving away from the opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not overstating the case to say that Australia's manufacturing and services industries&mdash;and, by definition, their employees&mdash;will be major beneficiaries of what the Prime Minister has correctly described as the historic GATT decision. In the context of manufacturing, it is worth pointing out that in 1992-93 manufactured goods exports comprised 29 per cent of Australia's total exports. The fastest growing subsector of our manufactured goods exports is in the area of elaborately transformed manufactured goods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting asides in relation to this GATT outcome is that Australia now has, in terms of applications for external patents, the highest rate of growth in the OECD. In 1975, we made about 2,000 applications for external patents. In 1990, we made applications for 20,000. This is one indicator&mdash;one straw in the wind, if you like&mdash;of what genuinely constitutes a clever country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these outcomes are of the utmost significance to Australia. We are extremely well placed to benefit from them. For example, our pharmaceuticals industry, which is going from strength to strength, underpinned by a range of government programs&mdash;I talked about that recently in the House&mdash;will gain access to new markets in Europe, the US, Japan and Canada. That is one example of the high-tech area benefiting from these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably not widely known, but last year the Australian steel industry, supplying predominantly to niche markets high technology steel product, exported more steel than the total United States steel industry combined. That is truly a milestone when one reflects on the fact that, only a decade ago, we were in prospect of seeing that industry topple over. In the services sector, these new arrangements will mean that Australia's construction companies, amongst some of the best in the world, will now have access to a range of new countries and bidding processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our telecommunications sector, an area where we are currently extraordinarily competitive in our region and elsewhere, will gain access to a whole suite of new opportunities in markets that hitherto were denied us. People often do not think of our banks and legal firms as prospective important exporters, but they increasingly are. They are increasingly being featured in success stories around our region. There are enormous opportunities for banks and legal firms. This will enable and encourage them to go that little bit further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is worth making the point to the opposition that times have never been more propitious for smart Australian companies. The reforms presided over by the Labor government during the 1980s and the 1990s have meant that we are ahead of the game. There are many countries now which are going to be bringing down their tariff barriers with all the consequent readjustment problems associated with that. They will be playing, in many respects, catch-up football. It is the Labor government that brought about these sometimes painful reforms. These reforms have meant that, in many areas, we are genuinely world competitive; we are getting smarter; and we are getting better faster. This is a propitious time in terms of the investment outlook for all of the reasons that we have spoken about in the last fortnight or so. I want to lend my congratulations to Peter Cook and all of those associated with this truly historic and important outcome.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Treasury has upgraded its forecasts of the economy for this financial year. In the process of making those adjustments to the forecast, Treasury took into account, firstly, official data from the Bureau of Statistics and, secondly, data from the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers, Dun and Bradstreet, and other organisations which regularly produce information particularly about business expectations, consumer confidence and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, the Treasury has been undertaking its own qualitative investigations through its liaison with business, particularly in the major capitals of Sydney and Melbourne. Indeed, we took the decision about a year ago to establish offices in Melbourne and Sydney so that we could engage in this business liaison so that Treasury would have an up-to-date idea of the attitudes and expectations of the business community in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process covers all industry sectors, all states and firms of all sizes. As a result, several hundred Australian businesses are now contacted each year on a rotating basis. Naturally, the information that is provided to the Treasury is on a commercial in-confidence basis. In order to ensure the flow of this information, that confidentiality must be respected. Nevertheless, I can in a general way draw on some of that information to say that, from the most recent round in November, the liaison process did reveal strong growth in employment prospects in relation to medium-sized businesses, particularly those reporting success in export markets. This is a very good indication of the sustainability of the recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, expectations of business is for growth to continue in the current months. Those industry sectors which were reporting particular buoyancy&mdash;including those for export&mdash;included dairy products; paper, printing and publishing; domestic air travel; the fast food business and others. This liaison process took place before the outcome of the Uruguay Round was fully appreciated. As the Prime Minister and others have indicated, that could only add to the sense of confidence and enthusiasm which Australian business must have not only for our domestic prospects but also for our prospects in international markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important points was that made by my colleague the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. In Australia much of the restructuring necessary to make our industries and firms competitive has already occurred. For many other countries, the undertakings made in the Uruguay Round mean they must now begin the process of restructuring&mdash;or continue it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Australian companies, firms and sectors already&mdash;as a result of decisions we took unilaterally in relation to reductions in tariffs, withdrawal of subsidies and opening up of our markets&mdash;have undertaken the necessary restructuring in order to make them more competitive. Now that this course has been set for the world, that all markets will become more open and competitive, Australian companies in many respects have a march on others around the world which have that process of restructuring in front of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to thank the Prime Minister for his generous remarks and also to emphasise what a great job Australian officials did in this process. Whilst those of us who were fortunate enough to be ministers during this process had our opportunities to participate, in between those ministerial meetings we had very high quality officials in the various departments slogging it out toe to toe with their opposite numbers around the world. We would not be at this point in the process had it not been for the fact that Australia provided to that negotiating process probably the highest quality officials of any country. Those officials were dedicated and tenacious, and did the necessary gruelling work; they wore down those who were&mdash;may I use the word&mdash;recalcitrant in the negotiation.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4216" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a misunderstanding of the green paper. The fundamental message of the green paper is that&mdash;and it is good news for this community&mdash;we can achieve a level of unemployment of five per cent by the year 2000. But to do so we must achieve and sustain a high rate of economic growth of about 4 1/2 to five per cent per annum. That would require, among other things, a continuation of low inflation and improving the quality of the labour supply. The job compact proposal is an essential mechanism in this process because it makes people more genuinely competitive for jobs by providing them with skills that are relevant to the contemporary labour market and by making them job ready in other ways. It would make the labour market more efficient and remove one of the speed limits on growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences of this&mdash;and these are the relevant job figures as far as the impact of the implementation of the green paper is concerned&mdash;are that it is not talking about 50,000 new jobs, but 1.1 million by 1996-97 and 2.3 million by the year 2000. That correct interpretation of the proposed job compact would do two things: firstly, it would remove quickly the large bulge of long-term unemployed, make the total unemployed pool more competitive and thereby help set the conditions for rapid and sustainable growth; secondly, it would solely in its own right put 250,000 long-term unemployed into jobs, reducing the number of long-term unemployed from 340,000 to 90,000 by 1998 and creating a permanent addition of 50,000 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences of not doing the sorts of things, or some close variant of them, that the committee suggests would be that we would be facing levels of unemployment out to those years of seven to eight per cent. Instead of being effectively one per cent of a total unemployment rate of about five per cent, it would be more in the realm of three or four per cent. Of course, if there is a change in the business cycle ultimately, as a result of the pressure of wage costs, that phalanx of long-term unemployed would subsequently grow. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, reports that the green paper suggests spending $2 billion for 50,000 jobs are entirely wrong. In total, the committee's options represent expenditure of up to $2 billion to secure 2.3 million new jobs and to ensure that a fair proportion of those jobs go to the long-term unemployed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> this morning, it was claimed that yesterday I arranged with the opposition to ask the first question of the day; that I denied being given the question; and that the opposition had given me access to the grant documents. These comments imply some kind of clandestine activity on my part and need clarification. I did not ask the opposition for the first question of the day. I did ask for a spot in the opposition question line-up and was subsequently offered the first question. Any suggestion that the question was given to me is not only totally wrong but also obviously has the effect of challenging my independence and integrity. No-one in the opposition line-up saw or had a copy of my question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the reason that I sought opposition help in acquiring the grant documents is quite simple. When my staff rang the library, they were told that they should ring the office of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). Our phone call to the minister's office in search of the documents was, however, not returned. I did what any honourable member would do. I rang someone. </PARA>

What a pathetic defence from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who, in his last answer in question time, got on to trivial issues like what is going to happen on seminars in January in defence of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) who is facing one of the most serious allegations that can ever be made against her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a damning indictment of the Prime Minister to stand up and say that he does not consider it important whether or not a minister has misled the House. He does not consider it important whether or not a minister can account for $30 million worth of taxpayers' money. He apparently does not consider it important that an Auditor-General can so damn and indict a minister as to her administration in relation to a program. He apparently does not consider it important that this government has no standards when it comes to ministerial accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing is patently clear, as a result of the proceedings that have taken place in this House over the last month. This is a minister who misled this parliament, and this is a minister who must resign. The Prime Minister must stand this minister down, or forever wear the stain of shame that he was the one who undermined one of the most sacrosanct principles of Westminster parliamentary democracy; the principle that a minister must account to the parliament; the principle that above all else a minister must never mislead the parliament. If this Prime Minister cannot find his way clear to stand this minister down for whatever reason, it will be the low water mark of ministerial responsibility in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will mean that ministers are above reproach for their conduct and actions in this House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a sham. It has no role in relation to accountability. It has no purpose in being able to elicit facts on behalf of the people of Australia. I make this clear: if the Prime Minister destroys ministerial accountability in this parliament, he destroys accountability to the people of Australia. He destroys accountability to them through this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1976 report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration as quoted at page 88 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In cases where the minister has misled parliament, condoned or authorized a blatantly unreasonable use of executive power, or more vaguely, where the minister's behaviour contravenes established standards of morality, resignation or dismissal is the appropriate action. In these cases, the factors which may often excuse the minister from blame for administrative blunders do not operate to the same degree: the minister's personal responsibility may be more easily isolated.</PARA>
<PARA>The background to this matter is a report of the Auditor-General, an independent statutory officer, to this parliament of matters that he found in relation to this minister's administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He found that this minister had, in a three-month period on the eve of the 1993 election, personally allocated nearly $30 million of taxpayers' money; not only had the minister allocated it, but she had personally selected 726 out of 2,800 applications for that money. She authorised expenditure outside categorisations of those that were warranted and deserving by her department. She authorised expenditure which gave Labor marginal seats $326,000 on average compared with an average of $163,000 for coalition marginal seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General went in to look at this program, quite prepared to clear this minister of political bias&mdash;but he was unable to do so. He was unable to make such a finding. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . proper documentation of the reasons for decisions would be able to satisfy any questions concerning the selection of approved grants. At the present time documentation is simply not available to answer such questions.</PARA>
<PARA>He was prepared to look at the documentation to see why the minister made these decisions outside the categorisation; to see why the minister made these decisions that just happened to favour the Labor Party on the eve of the election. He was prepared to clear the minister, but there was no documentation on the decisions, and therefore no line of defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, as the Auditor-General said himself, it is only in a minister's best interests to provide such documentation because it is the first line of defence for a minister in these circumstances. He said that it is only proper that there be an audit trail because it is the first line of accountability for ministers in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the critical question in this House became: if the Auditor-General could not find such documentation, where was the documentation and what documentation did this minister have? We know from the department that she had only rudimentary documentation. We know that she went outside the department looking to other sources to try to help her in her decision making. But when the Auditor-General asked, `What documentation did you actually have for you to personally make these decisions?', the only thing she could come back with was a list of grants approved, by seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even that&mdash;the only documentation that she was able to provide&mdash;is more than revealing. If we look at the documentation the minister had prepared in her office on the grants she made to the ACT, we see that it is actually in the form of a memo. The memo is to Phil Ruff&mdash;he was in the department&mdash;from Steve Whan, who was in the minister's office. The heading is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACT GRANTS AS APPROVED BY ROS, TO BE ANNOUNCED TOMORROW (Wednesday) AT 1PM&mdash;Could I get the descriptions by then???</PARA>
<PARA>She had actually approved the grants and was getting her office to go back to the department to give the descriptions of what she had actually approved. That was the documentation that existed in her office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we knew that there was other documentation. We knew that there was other documentation because this minister had faxed, out of her office, a document to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). The document set out the proposals that were in his electorate of Gellibrand. It classified the electorate as ALP and as safe Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where the Auditor-General has said that there is no documentation to explain the minister's decision making basis and, therefore, that there is no documentation to explain whether or not there was political bias. We are looking for the documentation and we are asking the minister about that documentation. The minister came into this place and said, `There is no need for me to table any documentation, there is no need for me to explain, because every document that I had has been given to the Auditor-General. Therefore, if there had been anything in any of those documents that would have conclusively proved this case against me, the Auditor-General would have reported it'. That was her defence. She said, `I have given everything to the Auditor-General, therefore I don't have to give it to you and therefore I don't have to table it in the parliament'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was absolutely critical that there was a document in existence&mdash;I do not believe it was the only one; I think it was one of a class that had not been given to the Auditor-General&mdash;that had not been given to the Auditor-General. The absolute significance of that was that the Auditor-General had been looking for documentation, this parliament had been looking for documentation, this minister had been asked for documentation and this documentation had come into the possession of the opposition because there had been a mis-fax&mdash;and the minister was being asked what actually happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When she was asked that, she came into this parliament on 23 November and gave an ironclad, guaranteed answer in relation to the question of documentation. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have said every day in this parliament for the last week, all the records in relation to this matter have been referred to the Auditor-General. He has had access to all of them. He has had access to every single document that is available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not true. The Auditor-General had not had access to that fax of 20 February 1992. That answer misled, lead astray, caused to go wrong, and gave the wrong impression. There is no question that that answer was misleading. It was not something that was absolutely accidental. She was reaffirming to this House, `As I have said every day in this parliament for the last week'. That is what she told this House. Anybody who read that answer would have assumed that she had given all documents&mdash;as she said, every single one&mdash;to the Auditor-General. That is not true. The minister misled parliament. She must go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She has come along today and said, `If you notice the interesting slide'. The interesting slide was from all documents she had given back on 23 November; then it became all applications she had given; and today it was all information that she had given. Today the minister even walked away from her own statement in this parliament. There would be no clearer evidence that she knew she misled the parliament in relation to that answer than the fact that she walked away from herself today in question time. She cannot use the justification, `Even though I did not say it, I was only giving documents that related to round 4'. She cannot use that defence because, as she well knows, the Auditor-General was not just looking at round 4 of grants under these applications but looking at the whole of the program. Even yesterday she knew that, because it was raised in this parliament yesterday that he had reported on how there had been doubling up between round 3 and round 4. He was looking at the whole program. He wanted documents in relation to the whole program. He was giving case studies of projects that had got grants under round 3 and round 4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another reason why the minister cannot come in and say, `I accidentally misled the House because I was only talking about round 4'. She was given the opportunity on Monday of this week to take that very defence. On Monday of this week, I sought to table that fax in the parliament. I asked her why it was that it had not been given to the Auditor-General. She could have come in here and said, `Because I was only giving him round 4 and not round 3'. She did not do that. She did not take advantage of that defence when she was given the perfect opportunity to do so on Monday, 13 December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, she was still maintaining on Monday that all of the documents had been given over. She maintained it in relation to a question that was put to her by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). She said, `I did not withhold; the Auditor-General had total access'. That was the picture that she was drawing on Monday of this week. To come in here now and say `Look, even though I didn't say it, what I must have meant was that I was only talking about round 4 and not round 3' falls into one very simple category: it is recent invention&mdash;it is invention after the fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister cannot take that defence either. The reason she cannot take that defence is that it opens up an even bigger hole. If she is saying, `I only gave him documents that related to round 4', the critical question becomes: where are all the documents relating to round 3? If that is her defence and she says that she only gave the Auditor-General documents relating to round 4 because she thought he only wanted documents relating to round 4, there is one way she can prove it. She can come into this House with all of the documents relating to round 3 and show how she withheld them because she misunderstood his question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We put that question as well to the minister in question time today: did she have any other such documents relating to round 3? Where are they? And where are the replies? If she wants to maintain that there was some ironclad, Chinese wall between round 3 and round 4, she had better come down with all of the documents relating to round 3 as well. But I do not think she wants to come down with those documents because they are the damning documents that would show that she was classifying seats all along, with the Labor members of parliament, according to their electoral status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that she was really concerned about in this use of taxpayers' money, in dishing out $29.5 million in three months, was to make sure that it got to the sensitive areas before the election. On that point was her one success in relation to this program. That was the only thing that she actually succeeded in doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor candidates did not let her down. They were out there campaigning for votes on the basis of how beneficent the government had been in relation to their electorates. They were putting out broadsheets and leaflets boasting about how the government had been so benign in relation to their electorates. That was the purpose. That was why the department was not involved. When she asked the department to classify by seats and the department said, `Put the request in writing', she refused to do so. She did not want to leave an audit trail. She did not want to make it possible for this Auditor-General to find the evidence that was going to show how grossly she had misused funds. She can run but she cannot hide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was bad enough that the minister maladministered in this way. But what is absolutely unforgivable is that she has tried ever since to cover up in this House what she actually did. This report came down one month ago. She has had nine sitting days in parliament to come in with explanations. She has had every day in this parliament to say what actually happened to that fax, but she has never ever once said what happened to it. In the explanation she gave today she indicated that she has said 5,000 times what happened to it. But she has never ever once told this House where that fax actually is, whether there are any like it, whether she got replies, whether she entreated all the Labor members. She has never ever once accounted for that document. The only thing she has said, on 23 November, is that she gave all the documents to the Auditor-General. That was plainly false and she misled this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were administrative faults in relation to this scheme. The department concedes that. There was a refusal to create an audit trail. The minister took the responsibility. The decisions were made personally. She decided to do that. She cannot hide behind the department. The minister misled this House and she has refused to come clean. She has not had the decency to resign, and now she must be sacked.

At the beginning of this debate I made it clear&mdash;and I will make it clear again&mdash;that I accept many of the Auditor-General's constructive recommendations for improving the administration of this program. However, today the Auditor-General confirmed, as he did in his report, that he did not find political bias in this program. Despite all the efforts of members of the opposition in parliament over the last few weeks, despite their wandering around the country pretending to be Sherlock Holmes and trying to dredge up scandals&mdash;in fact, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) even advertised in his local paper to try to find unhappy applicants&mdash;they have failed to find any political bias. Every single case that they have brought up has been answered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even as late as yesterday, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) raised an issue about a grant awarded to the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese in Melbourne. He asked why it was, when there were several parishes in his electorate, that this facility went to the Coburg parish. The honourable member, not surprisingly, did not dispute the fact that this was an area of very high need, or that it had a very high ethnic population, and therefore met the grant criteria. The honourable member for Wills is correct in saying that there are four parishes in the Wills electorate&mdash;Coburg, Brunswick, Fawkner and Moonee Ponds. However, that seems to be where his knowledge of the electorate ends. He does not seem to know that the other three parishes already have this type of centre. Apparently the gentleman he referred to, Mr Kardamitsis, works for the Greek Welfare Association and is indeed based near the new centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the application for this centre was submitted by the Greek Orthodox Church of Australia and was signed by the appropriate bishop. I received a letter this morning from the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia. This point illustrates once again that, every time those opposite raise one of these issues, there is an answer. They have not proved, in any way, political bias. First of all, let me tell honourable members what the bishop says:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 31 May 1993, the auditor wrote to me informing me that he was conducting an audit into the programs and asking me questions on the process for approving applications. His letter specifically mentioned the round of grants for which applications closed on 3 September 1992; that is, round 4. The auditor confirmed this morning during the parliamentary committee hearing that he was looking at round 4 and that that the fax in question concerned round 3 of the program. In my response to this correspondence I pointed out a number of criteria which I took account of. I have repeated them in the House many times. Later the auditor wrote to me again, saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your letter has helped us better understand the process for selecting applications for approval.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to request documentation which showed the justification for approving one application but not another. In my response I confirmed the advice from the department that copies of records held in my office were available on departmental files. However, I did provide via my department a rough list of the grants broken up by electorates which was compiled in response to inquiries about successful grants from members of parliament from both sides of the House. Once again, the Auditor confirmed this morning that he did not think it was particularly unusual to put these into electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House should note that at all times any request for information, be it general or specific, was complied with. The fax referred to by the honourable member for Higgins was one that was made public in February 1992. The information on the fax was an extract of the list of summaries of applications for grants for round 3 of the program. The full list of this information was made available to the Auditor via the departmental list. The Auditor confirmed this in the parliamentary committee hearing this morning. He also added that he did not think it was unusual to link grants with electorates. More importantly, when he was asked about the fax, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't know that it is that important.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that the fax was on the public record. It was reported by the media in 1992 following a press release from Senator Warwick Parer and it was the subject of discussion in Senate estimates in April 1992. But to really get to the point of misleading, I think we ought to refer to the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, as I did in question time, on 14 December. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member laughs, but what he has attempted to do is to involve a statutory office holder, someone who has the confidence of this parliament, in a political exercise. That is what he has attempted to do. The Auditor confirmed this morning that he had a number of conversations with the honourable member for Higgins. However, as I said earlier in question time, he has directly repudiated some of the statements the honourable member for Higgins has made regarding their conversations. So who is the person who has been misleading? This is the man who got into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, who made statements involving the Auditor-General, claiming the Auditor-General had said certain things, and the Auditor-General this morning said that was not true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that does seem to be true, however, is the claim by the honourable member for Higgins that the Willis fax had been given to the Auditor-General in 1992 after it was drawn to the attention of a Senate estimates committee. It was quite clear that this fax was on the public record and it is indeed reported that the Auditor had the fax. And guess what? It was even in the parliamentary library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, the Auditor had access to all the information contained in the fax. I did not withhold any information. I made all information relevant to the decision-making processes available to the Auditor. I stand by my previous comments to the parliament&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Auditor-General had access to all the files that were in my department and had access to the material in my office. Included in that material is the list of all the applications of all the grants throughout the whole country, not just those in the </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">electorate of the honourable member for Gellibrand, but in every other single electorate in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>My comments and my actions have been entirely consistent with the statement I made on 23 November when I stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . all the records in relation to this matter have been referred to the Auditor-General. He has had access to all of them. He has had access to every single document that is available.</PARA>
<PARA>The parliamentary committee hearing this morning has confirmed the advice that I have previously given to the Auditor and to parliament. Opposition members have also made many other false points about this report and this program. They have claimed that my categorisation had no influence when it is clear that if the department put a grant into category one it had a much better chance of success than if it was categorised in category three. They have also made false claims about the maximum amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other things those opposite forgot to take into consideration is the number of applications. The shadow finance spokesman, the honourable member for Higgins, is very fond of quoting the electorate of McPherson. McPherson, he points out, is part of the fastest growing area in Australia. He is correct on that, and on a number of other criteria. On the face of it, it seems unfair that there were no successful grants in the electorate. However, he has forgotten one important factor: groups have to apply before they can be awarded grants. In McPherson only one application was received&mdash;the average per electorate was 20; in some cases it was over 70&mdash;and unfortunately that application was not of a very high standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly this is all a smokescreen for the very fact that honourable members opposite hate this scheme and do not want it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has misled the House in relation to two issues&mdash;the second one being the matter of the $250,000. Despite the blusterings of the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), who was trying to force his way into the hearing of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts this morning, we were able to produce some evidence. Part of that evidence was the Auditor-General's department saying that it knew nothing about this $250,000&mdash;not one single thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister again misled this House in a press release issued last night by saying that her department had told the Auditor-General about it. The simple fact is that her department had not told the Auditor-General. So she has now misled this House in relation to two very serious matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the House to the project guidelines for 1991-92 and 1992-93. In relation to the $250,000, the guidelines do not talk about `round'; they talk about `project'. The $250,000 is per project. The minister is trying to run away from that, saying, `It is for separate programs'. I invite honourable members to guess the completion date for projects under the 1991-92 and 1992-93 guidelines&mdash;two different application rounds. It is 31 May 1994 for both lots of applications. The minister, therefore, cannot come into this House and talk about there being two different rounds and the applications not being eligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting thing is that as far back as 1992 the minister knew when this program was going to finish. She knew it was going to finish after the election, otherwise why would she allow a couple of years to complete the 1992 round but only about 12 months to complete the 1993 round? She knew that this program would be finished after the election. This program was only a con by which to put $30 million into the electorate prior to the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has come into this House and accused members on this side of not supporting the program, of hating it and regarding it a conspiracy. But the minister heard one of the members of the coalition giving her views about it to the committee this morning. It is the minister who has finished this program. Not one sporting club in Australia can put in an application for a grant now&mdash;but I can tell the House when they will be able to do it. They will be able to do it in the application round that the minister mysteriously pulls out of the budget process in the run-up to the next election.

This letter is a very special document. Guess why? It has not been through the shredder. That is terrific! We now have two documents&mdash;one regarding Mr Willis and this one.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can't put an end to speculation that there was political bias. It is important to nip in the bud allegations about political bias, but we're unable to do so. The lack of documentation meant a lack of justification for the decisions. It is the applications&mdash;</PARA>

In the electorate of the honourable member for Watson&mdash;and this is an absolute doozey&mdash;$250,000 was given to the Hurstville council in 1991. Do honourable members know what has happened with that project? The planning appeal provisions were opened up two nights ago. The council has not approved the project.

I could see quite clearly from the Auditor-General's demeanour that he was embarrassed by the efforts of opposition members to put him in the position of prosecutor; embarrassed by their efforts to claim from him things that he allegedly said; embarrassed by their public claims and their lies when they went out in public and made statements about the fact that they had started him running down the road for an inquiry in this regard and that he had been responding to the fax that is constantly being waived around in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Auditor-General was invited to confirm these statements made on the public record by Sancho Panza who moved this motion, he stepped right back from those propositions. He has been walking away&mdash;indeed, conducting himself, I would say, at a decent jog&mdash;from the suggestions that are being made by the opposition in regard to the administration of this particular element. I will be particularly interested to hear what the Auditor-General has to say about the performance of those opposite in this place now that he has had an opportunity to actually place himself on the public record again in light of the matters raised by those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite sought to convince us that there were three things which, in their minds, should cause the minister for the environment to be censured. One was the question of that fax and the information contained in it. Another that they invited us to contemplate was the $250,000 limit. This was their second area of concern which they believed should cause the minister for the environment to be censured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the first point, when we actually sit down and take a look at that fax, what does it entail? It entails a simple statement to the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) of applications made in his constituency. It is not a document which plots, connives or in some way or another inveigles him to put forward some applications. Obviously somebody in his office asked for some information on what was actually going to be made available or who had actually applied for grants in his electorate&mdash;a commonsense proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element is that at the same time as those opposite are standing up in this place and alleging that the Auditor-General does not have this document, they are wandering around in public saying, `We gave this document to the Auditor-General, and the Auditor-General used it as the basis of his inquiry'. The Auditor-General is supposed not to have this document according to these geniuses opposite. Of course, we know that that proposition is a lie because the Auditor-General told us that it was a lie. As far as he was concerned, it did not actually get to the point of being a matter that he needed to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did he receive the document allegedly from an opposition source&mdash;those opposite lied and said that that had caused him to conduct the operation&mdash;but also the second proposition is that somehow or other this document was teased out surreptitiously. It was tabled in parliament, it was part of an inquiry process in the Senate. It is recorded in the parliamentary library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the case of a predecessor in the state seat of Kalgoorlie who was invited to go down to Perth to find out why the beer prices in Kalgoorlie were rising. He went to Perth, talked to everybody concerned, came back to Kalgoorlie and reported that never was alcohol so anonymous. Never has a document that is allegedly not in the possession of the Auditor-General found its way to him by so many blinking channels as this particular document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the Auditor-General have to say about this devastating document when he was finally questioned about it by the parliamentary committee? He said, `Oh, I don't think it really means very much. I'm not particularly interested in this. It doesn't actually add to the sum total of human knowledge about this particular problem. We're not particularly concerned about this'. But is that not such a typical attribute of Sancho Panza to the vain knight palely loitering that he should labour so mightily to produce such a mouse? Those opposite then say, `There was sometimes an organisation that was awarded more than $250,000. Maybe that was against the guidelines. Ah-ha. Perhaps the Auditor-General did not know about that'. Let me quote again the secretary to the department, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This issue was not the subject of a formal recommendation by ANAO and consequently it was not dealt with in our comments on the draft report. However, officers of the Department explained to the auditors during the course of the audit how this aspect operated.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General was, on the advice of the secretary to the department, advised repeatedly by the department as to how that element of the proposition operated and how it was possible for people to enter into a couple of different rounds of the one project and receive $250,000 on each occasion. So the gigantic mine that is supposed to have been thrown across the path of the minister for her to put her foot on is yet another damp squib. Not only did she put her foot on it and crush it, but also the secretary to her department more than adequately crushed it in the context of this debate. Those opposite have laboured mightily to produce a totally damp squib in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listen here, some people think you are in this House under false pretences and we actually have to be very careful about having you around. I turn now to the proposition that the opposition is really complaining about, and that is the notion that greater amounts of this money ended up in marginal seats held by the Labor Party as opposed to marginal seats held by opposition members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we move away from the aggregates and look at the individual cases we see a vast array of difference. Some opposition held marginal seats received a great deal of money. Some Labor held marginal seats received very little. As we move through the system we find some coalition seats that were well held. The safest coalition seat in the entire country&mdash;that held by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey)&mdash;received a very substantial amount of funds. Some Labor held marginal seats in Western Australia received virtually nothing at all. That is obviously one of the many reasons why the Auditor-General did not even feel inclined to say that there was a prima facie case of political bias as far as this was concerned and why he was prepared to make no finding of political bias whatsoever. When he looked at it in detail, he was no doubt influenced in that view by the fact that the proposition could not be sustained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite should not be surprised that that would be the case, because when we actually look at the propositions on which judgments were based we can see how they would produce a series of differing results in different areas of different political character. That is why we would see that, on some occasions, safe Liberal and National seats received a great deal of money and on other occasions quite unsafe Labor held seats received virtually nothing at all. We can see that when we look at the suggestion that the allocation should be based on residents in new suburban areas, residents in inner urban areas, youth in the community, communities in rural areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, communities with high unemployment, and communities with large immigrant populations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be said that when we look at those statistics they do not, on the whole, reflect the bulk of the seats that the Liberal Party holds. They are not well represented among the migrant community. They are not well represented in outer metropolitan areas. They are not well represented in areas which experience high unemployment. It is not easy to find Liberal members from any of those areas. We can find some, and when we find some we actually find them receiving quite generous grants&mdash;as did the honourable member for O'Connor, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid)&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that having put down a set of criteria&mdash;bearing in mind that this is the party that forms the government and bearing in mind that marginal seats are often to be found in outer suburban areas where, because they are growing areas, they have inadequate supplies of sporting facilities&mdash;it is not unusual that those seats would receive those grants and therefore a large number of Labor Party held seats would be receiving those grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite might dislike that. But, argue against these criteria: do those opposite think it ought to go to people who are not resident in new suburban areas; who are not resident in inner suburban areas; who do not represent youth in the community; who are not in a community in rural areas; who are not Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders; who are not communities with high unemployment; who are not communities with large immigrant populations?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me say at the outset that the government accepts all of the amendments that the Senate has made to the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. Of course, that includes the amendments moved by the Australian Democrats, those adopted by the Senate, having been moved by the Greens, and, indeed, two opposition amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the opposition amendments, one of those is an amendment that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) moved in this chamber when debate on the reform bill proceeded a few weeks ago. The amendment prevents an employer dismissing an employee because the employee is not a member of a union. When the House debated this&mdash;I think it was 22 November&mdash;I explained that the advice I had received was that it did not appear that there was any satisfactory legal foundation for the amendment as proposed. But, having said that, I indicated that we would be more than willing to look at it afresh when the matter was debated in the Senate&mdash;and look at it afresh we did. Although we still have some reservations about the legal position, the government accepts that the amendment should be agreed to. We certainly do not want our position on this issue to be capable of any misrepresentation whatsoever, and I can say to the chamber that we are certainly not opposed to the principle reflected in the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were also, of course, some government amendments in the Senate. These reflect further consultation with interested parties. They also include a number of technical changes to the bill that are aimed at making it operate more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main changes that have been made to the bill as a result of these amendments include the following. New grounds of discrimination have been added to the anti-discrimination provisions of the bill. These new grounds are in respect of sexual preference, age and physical or mental disability. The anti-discrimination provisions will not apply to decisions about employment in an institution that is conducted in accordance with the beliefs of a religion if the reason for the decision is to avoid injury to religious susceptibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paid rate awards will be dealt with by the new bargaining division of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission but separately from the bargaining functions of the division and with additional safeguards to prevent the terms of paid rate awards from flowing on to minimum rate awards. The commission will review every three years the operation of certified agreements and enterprise flexibility agreements&mdash;that is, both the union agreements and the new non-union agreements&mdash;which have passed their specified periods of operation but which are continuing to have effect as awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be an annual report on the effect of enterprise bargaining, particularly in respect of women, part-time employees and immigrants in the workplace. There will be a decision on carer's leave by the commission, providing a basis for government consideration of future legislation guaranteeing carer's leave&mdash;that is, leave care for a member of an employee's immediate family who is ill. There will be more flexible notice requirements for an employer wishing to engage in a lockout during the bargaining period for a certified agreement. Finally, there will be a requirement that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, in dealing with an agreement in relation to underrepresented groups, such as women and people with non-English speaking background, properly inform these groups in respect of the terms and realities of that proposed agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approval of the amendments in this chamber will complete the passage of the bills through the Australian parliament. The consultative process underpinning the development of the legislation has certainly been most extensive. As I have said before, it would not have been possible to please everyone in framing the legislation. We had to arrive at a balanced decision. We believe that the package that we have put together strikes exactly the right balance, providing flexibility and, at the same time, guaranteeing fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It provides, in our view, what is certainly the best basis for sustainable and dynamic improvements to the productivity of our work force. As well, it guarantees the continuation of the cooperative approach to industrial relations that our government has pursued throughout its life and which has served Australia so well in recent years. It is the sort of approach that sees industrial disputation today at a record 50-year low. It is 62 per cent lower than for the comparable period under the Fraser government in which the honourable member for Bennelong served as Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, during the process of this legislation, there have been disagreements over one or other of its elements. Everyone has had their sixpennyworth. We have seen all sides express their ire about some aspects. Now is the time to put all of those differences aside, to accept that this package of legislation is the law of Australia and for all of the parties&mdash;employers, employees, unions and employer groups&mdash;to work together and to guarantee that the critical business of enterprise bargaining and workplace reform proceeds. Whether one is an employer, an employee or a trade union, the need to take advantage of the very real opportunities that are provided in this legislation&mdash;which are now available to guarantee cooperative work for the benefit of all Australia, to guarantee our productivity and to guarantee this nation's future&mdash;is very great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stressed in the debate yesterday on the green paper  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Restoring full employment</EMPHASIS> that putting the framework for negotiations in place is one thing, but more important are the attitude and commitment of the parties. We can provide the framework, but the parties must have a desire and a willingness to work towards achieving the outcomes that are available under this legislation. The key priority now must be to put this legislation into operation cooperatively and constructively to achieve real and lasting improvements in productivity and in all of the working relationships of Australia's businesses. This must occur, in our view, at the workplace level if it is to be of real value. The means for this are now in place. I have indicated that we would anticipate that this legislation would come into effect on 30 March next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not share any of the jubilation expressed by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) at the passage of this piece of legislation. The attempt by the minister to capture the spirit of the season when he said, `Now is the time for a bit of peace and goodwill and everybody working together', sits very strangely at odds with the truculent arrogance he and his Prime Minister (Mr Keating) displayed at question time when they talked about people coming second. Yes, we did come second in the election. But, worse than that, the Australian people come second under this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has absolutely no moral authority to call for a cooperative spirit in relation to this legislation, because this is winner-takes-all legislation. This is not balanced legislation. This is legislation that delivers the commitments the minister made to the trade union movement before the election. This is legislation which, in the words of Jennie George, the Australian people are getting because the employers lost the election and the trade union movement won it. The minister has always seen industrial relations in terms of them and us. He has never seen it in terms of people cooperating at workplaces. He has always seen it in terms of rigging the rules, just as he rigged the Prime Minister's ballot 23 years ago. He has always seen industrial relations in those terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason that he accepted our clause in relation to discrimination against non-unionists is that he had no alternative. He did not do it out of some great act of magnanimity. If the Australian Democrats had not agreed with us in the Senate, he would have rejected it. The minister should not pretend to the chamber that it was otherwise. He should not come in here and confect a generosity of spirit when in reality he was forced by numbers&mdash;the only thing that he understands&mdash;to agree to our clause. If he really believes that he ought to treat non-unionists and unionists equally, why did he not agree when I moved the amendment in this chamber? The only reason that he decided to accept it was that the numbers were against him. That is the only language that the minister understands. I understand that. We lost the election and the government won it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government has done in this legislation is pay out on that election result. It paid the unions back. It could not give a damn about the employers. It ostracised the Housing Industry Association. Why did it ostracise the Housing Industry Association? Because the Housing Industry Association had the temerity to campaign against the Labor Party in the election. That is why the government ostracised it. I notice that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is nodding in approval. This is the measure of the political morality of this government. It believes that, whoever wins the election, the system is entitled to be rorted in favour of the victors. Just as the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) rorted those sports grants, these blokes are rorting the industrial relations system in favour of those who won the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government really had claims to govern for the entire Australian community, it would not have brought in this piece of legislation. But honourable members opposite get up in the House&mdash;and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is a past master of this&mdash;and parade moral indignation: he never thought he would sit here and hear anybody say something like that. He carries on as though he has a monopoly on morality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government has done with this industrial relations legislation is to further entrench trade union monopoly power over the bargaining process of this country. What it has done in this legislation is to add to the potential for higher unemployment in Australia. The amendments that have been approved by the Senate are very great in number. I do not have the time to go through all of them. I welcome the fact that as a result of the Democrats agreeing with the coalition the government has been forced to accept a requirement that non-unionists be given the same sanctity of conscience&mdash;if I can put it that way&mdash;as unionists. That is only fair, proper and decent. I welcome that fact. But that is no thanks to the government, or to the Labor Party, or to the trade union movement. The only reason that has happened is that the Democrats, for once, were a little even-handed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats were not even-handed when it came to preference clauses. I want to put down the canard that was put around by Senator Bell that in some way the coalition had misunderstood or misled the Democrats in negotiations about that particular amendment. I had an arrangement with Senator Bell that we would vote together to excise from the legislation any hint of preference for members of a trade union. Senator Bell and his colleagues decided to welsh on that understanding. I say no more about it, other than to simply record the fact that we had that particular arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By far the worst feature of this bill, and one that is referred to in the amendments now before the committee, is the destruction of the secondary boycott provision of the Trade Practices Act. There can be no justification at all for giving trade unions in this country an immunity which is not available to other sections of the community. There is no way that government members can twist and turn, cavil, carry on and pretend that they are not, by this change, giving trade unions a protection, an immunity and a privilege that are denied to other sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They can shake their heads in mock horror at such a suggestion. The fact is that, under the law of Australia, once this bill receives the royal assent it will be possible for a trade union to impose a secondary boycott on a corporation and escape the consequences that would be suffered by a company that imposes a secondary boycott on the same corporation. In other words, the government has decided, under this legislation, to give trade unions treatment above the law. There can be no justification for that. That is why we charge the government with being a government led by the nose by the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter how many speeches the minister makes or how many interviews he gives pretending that it is a fair and balanced bill&mdash;and that he has agonised long and hard; he has kept everybody up all night; he has burnt the midnight oil; and he has gone the length and breadth of Australia&mdash;at the end of the day the destruction of the secondary boycott law exposes the minister for the union toady that he is. It exposes him as having done the bidding of the Australian Council of Trade Unions once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with two or three other specific amendments. First of all, in relation to the decision to seek, in effect, some kind of adjudication by the Industrial Relations Commission on the question of carers provisions, the coalition is against putting further minimum provisions into the award system. We believe that there ought to be minimum conditions relating to such matters as annual leave, sick leave, maternity leave and minimum hourly rates of pay and that other things should be a matter of negotiation. Of course it is desirable that compassionate leave be given to people to look after members of their families, but those matters are best negotiated on an enterprise by enterprise basis. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now is the time to put all of those differences aside . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have a message for Minister Brereton: they ain't going to be put aside. Never in a month of Sundays will he get us to agree to this bill, which is totally designed to keep his mates, who funded Labor's re-election to keep it in government, on side. That is what this bill is all about. The only reason we have amendments to this bill is that these officers, who stayed up all night, were forced to put this thing together at such a pace. Because this bill is so confusing, we wound up with how many pages of amendments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the Democrats got stuck into the minister a bit too, although I must say that I think the Democrats have some difficulty in understanding the bill. Nonetheless, we wound up with 500 amendments of the most complex and most detailed industrial relations legislation that this nation has ever seen. No-one really understands the bill. The minister thinks he does, but he does not understand the implications of it in front of the AIRC or of the day to day impact on industry or small business in Australia. He does not have a clue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the minister even understands the climate out there. Does he know what brought this bill about? What brought it about was that he got his marching orders from the boss, did he not? On 21 April, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said to the Institute of Company Directors, `We are going to open up the industrial relations system. We are going to make the award system simple. We will collapse awards. We will reduce them to a very small component; get working conditions out of awards; make it easy. We are also going to open up this thing called enterprise bargaining to the Liberal Party's concept that it told the nation about a few years ago and let the non-union sector of the private sector work force do its own deals and make its own bargains'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister went and told this to the Institute of Company Directors and everybody around Australia got excited. They thought, `Fair dinkum, the Prime Minister has been listening to the honourable member for Bennelong. He has been listening to the honourable member for La Trobe. He has been paying attention and he has finally gotten the message and he is going to let us have a shot at trying to really reform the industrial relations system, so perhaps we can do something about unemployment in this nation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened was that the Prime Minister got busy on Mabo and the budget deficit debacle; and he forgot all about industrial relations. He sent the minister off to do his job for him. At the same time, Bill Kelty was running around the country, busy with regional development and the Reserve Bank. He did not know what was happening either. The minister got rolled by the secretaries of the most powerful unions in Australia. They took him to pieces at the ACTU congress. They ripped him up one side and down the other and spat him out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they had finished spitting him out, the Prime Minister came in and said, `We are sorry, we did not really mean to upset you blokes. You got us back in in this election that we did not have a chance of winning. You spent the money and put the foot soldiers in to make sure we got back&mdash;and I will make sure that I tell Laurie Brereton how to play the game'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and Secretary Bill Kelty finally put their eyes back on the ball game and said that the Minister for Industrial Relations had promised things that the Prime Minister had said we would do, but we cannot have them because the union chiefs will not let us. So they said we will have a big farce and further overbalance the industrial relations legislation equation in favour of the union bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we have? The minister, at question time, talked about protection&mdash;at the same time as the Prime Minister was talking about GATT. GATT is all about the elimination of protection in order to provide an impetus to the economy and to provide employment. That is what it is all about. GATT means jobs because we are eliminating around the world protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what does the minister do in the industrial relations bill? He brings in page after page of more statutes of protection. He calls that an impetus for employment. He says we should be happy about it and put our differences aside. He has to be joking! If it were not so serious, it would almost be funny. In the green paper that came out yesterday there is talk about how we will address this mammoth problem which those opposite caused. Let there be no mistake about it: the Labor government members caused the one million unemployment figure with the unbelievably high interest rates that just about killed business in Australia. They caused it&mdash;and now they want to fix it, at least politically, by increasing taxes. Is that not delightful? Nobody has ever heard of a tax led recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things the minister might do is let people have real enterprise bargaining, let the people who do not belong to unions strike deals with their employers without the unions having a bureaucratic say so over it. The minister does not believe in that. In his speech on these amendments he said, `Look what a wonderful job I have done. I have incorporated an opposition amendment which was put forward by the honourable member for Bennelong'. That amendment means that, where it is stated in the bill that it is illegal to dismiss an employee because he is a member of a union, it now has the contra that says it is illegal to dismiss someone because he is not a member of a union. The only reason the government accepted that amendment was that the Democrats said it had to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We put up another amendment. There is a clause in the bill which says it is an offence to induce a member of a union or an official of a union to leave the union or quit being an official. We put up the contra that it should be an offence to induce a non-member of a union to become a member of a union. But that was not accepted because the Democrats did not buy it. I do not think they understood it. That is part of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the minister really understands industrial relations. If he did, he would recognise that the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, in issuing his annual report this week, has condemned the government. He said the legislation has become so complex that the commission does not know how to deal with it. He issued the government a challenge. He said he has a real problem if the commission deals with an award and then a union and an employer say they have made an agreement to vary the award. The AIRC may look at the public interest test and say, `What you have done is a heap of rubbish. It does not represent an improvement in productivity. There is no cost justification for this modification you want to make to the award'. So they go away and come back with the agreement presented as a consent agreement. The AIRC cannot take into account the public interest test, and so this non-representative wage increase or change in conditions goes through automatically. The commissioner says he is concerned about that because compulsory arbitration is finished. Those opposite finished it, not us. But they did so without understanding what they were doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is so complex that I do not think any of us yet know the total outcomes, ramifications and effects of this bill. The minister said yesterday, `The fact is that the opposition has never really had original ideas. When it comes to the republic, it is good old Mother England'. Was it the minister's original idea to trade the Queen, as head of Australia, for a bunch of faceless bureaucrats in Geneva, through the ILO convention which now is the king of Australia? It was a terrific idea but the people of Australia, when they wake up to what the government has done to this nation by imposing bureaucratic will from Geneva on Australian working men and women's lives, will not be very happy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I follow the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who made an excellent speech with an extraordinarily large number of valuable points. This industrial relations issue in the Industrial Relations Reform Bill which has come back before the chamber concerns one of the seminal issues of Australian politics&mdash;although not the only one. The debate is about continuing with entrenched privilege in the interests of union officials and the Australian Labor Party, which is a creature of the trade union movement, or putting individuals in Australia before entrenched privilege. As is said in the United States, it is about empowering individuals and giving that the highest priority. I had hoped this parliament would do that, but apparently it will not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation was passed with amendments by the Senate a couple of days ago. It has come back to the House of Representatives today. The government has accepted a green paper on initiatives to reduce unemployment. This is ironic because at the very heart of the unemployment problem lies our industrial relations system. This green paper which was presented to the government yesterday&mdash;a green paper prepared overwhelmingly by government officials&mdash;is notable in one respect; that is, the scarce comment about our industrial relations system. A coherent report on why we have such high levels of unemployment in Australia would be dominated, chapter after chapter, with discussion about the failings of our industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for La Trobe made a good point in challenging the minister to come forward and explain what ideas the government had to reform the industrial relations system. This debate goes back quite some time, to the early to mid-1980s, when on this side of politics we were arguing that the way to keep unemployment down, improve productivity and the competitiveness of the economy was to cast aside the entrenched privileges that had been in place through our industrial relations system since the turn of the century, liberalise that system and give it greater flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in the mid-1980s people in the Labor Party were saying that this was heresy. It was heresy to say that we should have a more flexible labour market. Those on the other side of the parliament talked incessantly about the accord. The accord was more important than anything else, and this talk about flexibility in the labour market was the talk of ideologues, radicals, fools and people given to excess. There was no end of abuse dished out to those on our side of politics for arguing for a more flexible labour market and deregulation of the industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has changed? The rhetoric of the Australian Labor Party has changed, because the Australian Labor Party knows that the intellectual debate has been won by those on our side of politics. There is virtually no-one with any economic education in this country&mdash;of course, I am excluding some of the people on the other side of the chamber who are here at the moment, because they would not fall into that category&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member certainly has no economic education. But the simple fact is there is no-one left in Australia who is in any way economically literate who does not realise that what we on this side of politics have been saying for a decade has been absolutely right. Nobody argues with that proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those in the Labor Party have decided that the path of minimal damage is, firstly, to continue to support the entrenched privileges of the trade union movement and the trade union leadership, which, of course, is part and parcel of the Labor Party; and, secondly, to say, `Let's adopt some of the rhetoric of the other side of politics so we can neutralise the debate'. That is what they have done. So we had the great scare campaign on, inter alia, industrial relations during the last election campaign. We were told that deregulation of the labour market was some sort of fascist concoction. After the election, in April, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visited the Institute of Company Directors in Melbourne. He told the Institute of Company Directors that the Labor government was effectively going to adopt the Liberal Party's industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot tell honourable members how many business people at that time came up to me and said, `It is just incredible; we couldn't believe the Prime Minister's speech. We couldn't believe the way he embraced enterprise bargaining and deregulation of the labour market'. I could not believe it, just as I am sure the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for La Trobe could not believe it. It is dead right&mdash;we could not believe it, because it was not worth believing. In the end the Prime Minister did a volte-face very quickly. From this grand vision of enterprise bargaining and a deregulated labour market came this miserable piece of legislation which is before the chamber at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forget what the opposition says; if we talk to employers, if we talk to academics in this area, they will tell us that this legislation reduces the flexibility of our industrial relations system&mdash;it does not enhance it. How many businesses in Australia are going to put together an enterprise agreement&mdash;talking about those which have no union membership at all&mdash;lug this enterprise agreement off to the Industrial Relations Commission, then run the gauntlet in the Industrial Relations Commission of time consuming debate, presumably with trade union officials who are able to challenge these enterprise agreements? If there is one trade unionist in the enterprise, the union is brought in and the so-called enterprise agreement becomes a deal which has to receive the rubber stamp of the trade union movement. </PARA>

It is an outrageous confection for government members to maintain that this legislation is going to improve the flexibility of the labour market. Those people need to talk to the business community to find out whether the business community agrees. It does not matter whom one talks to in small businesses or big businesses&mdash;people in the business community think this legislation is a dud. Their expectations were lifted in April and, bang, they have been dropped. And they have been dropped because, in the end, Bill Kelty and Martin Ferguson would not accept a deregulated labour market. And why not? Because they care about the protection of workers? The Labor government has put a million workers out of work and real wages have declined by 5.3 per cent since 1984-85.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) boasted that the government has reduced real wages. Is this something to be proud of? A benchmark of success is to improve people's living standards and make them feel a bit happier, not reduce their wages. That is the record of the Labor Party, which says it is concerned about working Australians. I find it almost unbelievable that the Minister has the gall to come into this parliament and argue the rhetoric that he has been arguing for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the victims of this legislation are the victims of the accord. They are the same people&mdash;they are the unemployed. They are the people who, because the government refused to liberalise the labour market, are going to remain out of work. The government will never reduce unemployment to acceptable levels if it does not move towards genuine enterprise bargaining and greater flexibility. </PARA>

In fact, I did grin a bit about the GATT claims. Apparently, only the EC, America and Australia were involved in it. That is what we heard today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government having lectured us on this matter, we have had another conversion on the road to Damascus. We are now told that tariff reduction is back in. My recollection was that the government was very pro-tariff reduction and was getting it past the parliament because the opposition supported it. That is a situation I would not anticipate occurring when the roles are reversed. It then became an election issue and the government became anti-tariff reduction and branded us as radicals because our policy for tariff reductions by the year 2000 was five per cent different from the government's. Now, of course, with the conclusion of GATT, the government has had another conversion on the road to Damascus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have supported the government on that, but where are we now? We are debating the final stages of more regulation of the labour market. Is that not amazing? The government is going to deregulate the tariff system and increase and entrench regulation of the labour market. In the most simple terms that is a recipe for exports&mdash;exports of Australians' jobs. The government is going to be shipping them out of this country at a rate it has never known. One cannot deregulate one side of industry and fail to deregulate the other. It can put itself in any position it chooses, but it cannot do what it is doing. In time, Senator Richardson will discover he cannot have it both ways in regard to health issues, either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are, debating this legislation again, and, as I said, after all the rhetoric of question time, we are being told that this regulation is necessary; that, in fact, this government stands for deregulation in the international trading environment and that it has got the secret recipe to make both policies work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stand here today as the only person in this chamber specifically identified by a political party as representing small business.

They certainly will not have the time to go through the complex processes that this legislation provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get to the issue of complexity. The reason this legislation is so complex and we need 42 amendments is that this is the only way the government can subvert the constitution. This legislation&mdash;the Mabo legislation has another 74 government amendments&mdash;is designed to achieve a level of complexity to get over the fundamental fact that the constitution does not allow the government to do these things. </PARA>

The point I am making about these amendments, and their effect on jobs, is that when the government makes legislation very complex&mdash;and it has to in order to get around this situation&mdash;it has long-term effects. In Western Australia a pipeline will be built which I believe will be made out of steel. It would be manufactured south of Sydney, and would create a lot of jobs. It might not happen as the Mabo legislation in this parliament might prevent that job going ahead. But I respect your view, Mr Deputy Chairman, so I will not go into the details. These people are voting against about 500 miles of steel pipe being made in proximity to their electorates, probably by people who live in their electorates.

A few minutes ago the minister got up here and said that this legislation, and the amendments that we are dealing with&mdash;I understand we are not dealing with them one by one but as a whole&mdash;will give us flexibility in the labour market. It certainly will not give small business any flexibility. Big business might be able to get through the complexities of it over time with its personal industrial relations departments, or human resource departments, as we must now politically correctly call them.

Yet the concept of a secret ballot put forward by the opposition was rejected. The government would not let people exercise the fundamental democratic right to cast a vote in secret.

There are 11 bills to be dealt with in the Senate. Some, such as the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, have already been returned and dealt with by this House. A number of others will be returned and dealt with tonight. We expect some to be returned and dealt with tomorrow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make only two points about this motion. The first is that the opposition will vote against the motion of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) because it contains no provision at all for question time. We take the view that, whenever parliament sits, question time ought to be available. I do not want to labour the point, but question time is an integral part of the daily sitting program of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I would like to make is simply this: we are headed for a Saturday sitting&mdash;that, of itself, causes me no particular personal concern; I hope it does not cause too many people on my side of the House concern, although I am aware of the consternation of one of my longer serving colleagues about the impact of a Saturday sitting, but I notice there are a few on the other side who may be a little concerned. On a more serious note, I think we are in this chaotic, rather uncertain end of year situation because the government has chosen to force through parliament a huge, cumbersome, unworkable piece of legislation on native title. The government would really do the Australian public a great favour by putting that legislation off until February. I suppose I will be in receipt of a spray from my friend the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner), who will get up and say that he never thought he would hear somebody in this parliament say that the Mabo legislation ought to be postponed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the reason the government will not postpone the legislation and the reason that we will sit on Saturday&mdash;we will sit on Sunday, or all of next week, if necessary&mdash;is that the government is frightened of putting off the legislation until February of next year because the fragile, insubstantial coalition it has put together in order to get the legislation through may come apart. That is the reason why the government will have parliament sit on Saturday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not mind sitting on Saturday, Sunday, Monday or whatever is necessary, but the Australian public would be better served if that cumbersome, unworkable and increasingly ramshackle piece of legislation were deferred until February next year. But those opposite will not have the guts to do that because they know darn well that the support that they were able to garner in the community will disappear, and they want to get the legislation through before Christmas before that support starts to fall apart. We are opposed to this motion and will be voting against it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) because it has been made very clear why these arrangements have to be made. There is quite a lot of legislation on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. Some of it has been debated in recent days. It is legislation that is acceptable in the community, and it will not be passed at this session. We will not be requested to discuss that legislation or vote further upon it on Saturday or Sunday because the government is not frightened about it. The government is not concerned that the public might rise up and demand that it be changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Burnt on the memory of those opposite is a thing called the ID card. They took too long to get it through the parliament. In the end people started marching in the streets. To quote one of the government's then ministers, `We were eventually saved from ourselves'. Government members know that, if there is a delay, they will not get their stupid, complex legislation on Mabo through. I pointed out minutes ago that this legislation will take work from the steelworks of Australia. I note that the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) is waving his hands in the air when in fact he should be deeply concerned. The first state to profit from approximately 600 kilometres of steel pipe that will be used in a gas project in Western Australia but which will be constructed in the steel industries of New South Wales is&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can tell the honourable member what it is. We are held up here by this motion. This motion is to make time in this parliament so that we can wait around until the Mabo legislation comes back. The Mabo legislation will delay the order of that steel pipe for months or years, and the honourable member's constituents will be the losers. Western Australia, which is fighting to the death against this legislation, is not the first winner from that pipeline&mdash;it is the steelworks of New South Wales. The honourable member for Newcastle, firstly, did not know it was happening and, secondly, does not care because he is tied to a party philosophy, and the people in his electorate who want the jobs that that project will create do not matter to him.</PARA></TALK.START>

All the government's more educated people never raise that point now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me repeat what is happening to the economy of New South Wales. The government is asking this parliament to sit around to pass a piece of legislation that will prevent the steelworkers of Port Kembla and probably Newcastle from getting the extra work of putting together a gas pipeline. Those opposite are doing this. They have voted against their people getting work because that work will be delayed. By the very nature of the government's legislation, those job opportunities will be delayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Aussie dollar goes up&mdash;as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) predicted today&mdash;by the time that pipeline is built, the steel pipe will probably be bought from Korea and those in the electorates affected will never get the work. Those opposite are on the run now because the dollar is down. But they are not worried about that. Their electors should be the first beneficiaries of that pipeline. The economics of it have always been a bit marginal. When the deal is done, 100 separate applications under the government's Mabo legislation have to be dealt with to give an easement for that pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Richard Court legislation, separate deals are done. Western Australia can place the order for the pipeline and can get on with the job. That would give the constituents of those opposite work. But of course the government will deal with compensation separately. The government's legislation that we are waiting for is so complex that it will be in the courts for years. Nobody can go ahead with those projects, and the constituents of government members will be the first losers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the great economic beneficiary of that pipeline is, in the first instance, New South Wales. It will be years before Western Australia, which is fighting for the constituents of those opposite while they neglect them&mdash;</PARA>

Somebody has got to put the argument for the people of Port Kembla and the people of Newcastle.

He comes from Newcastle&mdash;a steel town. One just would not believe it. That is what we are waiting for: a decision to delay a project that will mean jobs and good work for people in New South Wales, people who vote Labor. That will get out.

Those opposite are the people who condoned that; they stood up to talk about it today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us talk for a moment about the running of this place and the government's denial of our further investigating that matter. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) told us that she has not got any more documentation. How many pages did it take to work out those electoral decisions and how to allocate the money? How many pages of calculations of who could win and who could lose did it take to decide to dump Ron Edwards, the former member for Stirling, and Carolyn Jakobsen, the former member for Cowan? How much money were they given? The government sent some out my end to try to justify it. Why did the government take the money from Ron Edwards and Carolyn Jakobsen? One bloke over there got $500,000 and the other blokes got $80,000 between them. </PARA>

In what way are the remarks of the honourable member for O'Connor relevant to the motion moved by the Leader of the House? I am being invited to quote standing order 145.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Andrew)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I have been listening to what the honourable member for O'Connor has had to say. I would have thought that of all debates in the parliament the debate on this motion was as wide ranging as is possible. I accept that the honourable member's remarks seem to have very little relevance to what the minister was saying, but I do not find him out of order given that there is no specific instruction for him to address specifically the motion before the House in any more precise terms. Now that I have the attention of the House, while I appreciate the fact that the honourable member for O'Connor has been somewhat provocative in his remarks&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for that ruling; it made the point quite clear. I remind the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) that in future it would be a good idea if he studied his standing orders and discovered what sorts of rules apply to various debates and, more particularly, as our Speaker said today, made his points of order relevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that we are debating a motion setting speaking times and setting the times that we will have to be in this parliament&mdash;which are not normal times and which are times when others have made particular arrangements as part of their normal programs. We are being warned that the sitting might even go into Saturday, and we are well aware of the inconvenience that will create for all sorts of people in terms of their other commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But why are we doing this? This is the point that the government seems to object to. I am giving the reasons why we are doing it. We are doing it because we have a government that is terrified to let everyone go home, talk to their own constituents and find out how those people are starting to get dreadfully concerned about the government's Mabo legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems amazing that I had to point out to members representing steel constituencies in New South Wales that this legislation represents a risk to the jobs of their own constituents. If anybody wants to stand up after me and say that that is not the case, I suggest they do so. But I think, over time, they will be proved wrong. Every week that that decision is delayed is a week in which their unemployed constituents do not get work and a week in which the prosperity of the great steel industry is diminished. Why should we be sitting around here waiting for legislation to come back from the Senate which guarantees delays to that project? It guarantees them by its format and its requirements. In fact, it just might put that industry at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a question those opposite have got to answer in the context of their own electorates if they have a commitment&mdash;as I have in this parliament&mdash;to putting their people first. That is why we are debating this point, and I am entitled to put to those opposite the reasons why this debate is on. It is about that piece of legislation and it is about the fact that there will be no question time tomorrow. In that regard, I am entitled to raise the reason why question time is getting cut off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know how vulnerable the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories is and of course that is why we will get no question time tomorrow. We have a minister who says in that regard that there is no more paperwork, when in fact people sat down in her office and went through a process of working out which seats were winnable and which seats were not. They got to the point where they apparently decided it was better to save the honourable member for Swan, better to save the new honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and better to save the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear). The government gave them grants of half a million each, but it only gave the sitting members for Stirling&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>It gives me great pleasure to introduce in the House the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1993. This is a historic occasion. Introduction of these seven bills brings to fruition efforts stretching back over 25 years to develop a truly national approach to the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only in July 1991 that the Commonwealth, states and territories governments agreed to establish a national registration scheme to replace the eight state and territory schemes. Since then, there has been considerable progress in implementing the scheme. From 1 July 1992, the Commonwealth has taken over from the states and territories all the evaluation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. In July 1993 we saw the establishment of the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my perspective, we have come a long way in a short time, but there is further to go. These seven bills will provide the NRA with its full range of functions and powers and they represent the final stage in the development of the national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals. Consistent with the government's commitment to a more open and transparent process for the assessment and registration of agricultural and veterinary chemical products, the government released this and the other registration bills as exposure drafts for public comment. Also, briefing sessions were held with the main stakeholders, that is, the states and territories, the agricultural and veterinary chemical industry, the rural sector, and consumer, public interest and environmental groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the invitation to comment on the exposure drafts, 33 submissions were received from a wide cross-section of the community. A considerable number of the suggestions  have been incorporated into these bills. The registration bills are fully supported by the agvet chemical industry, the National Farmers Federation, the Commonwealth agencies involved in the scheme and the state and territory agricultural agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consumer, public interest and environmental groups will welcome those provisions of the bills which will ensure improved public participation, greater availability of information for the public and the public's right to seek an injunction and empower the NRA to hold public and private hearings.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should emphasise, however, that the agvet code is being introduced without the formal agreement of the states or the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) proposes to seek the necessary agreement before the agvet code is debated during the 1994 autumn sittings. In this regard, the minister wishes to acknowledge the generous assistance provided by the states and territories in developing the scheme and the draft legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to specifically address the provisions of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill. The purpose of this bill is to make provision for the agvet code to have effect in the Australian Capital Territory. The code contains provisions for the evaluation, registration and control of chemical products. Furthermore, the code is to be adopted by the legislatures of the states and the Northern Territory as a law of those jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also provides that the whole legislative package will commence on a date agreed to with the states and Northern Territory. In view of the need for the states and Northern Territory to enact complementary state law, provision has been made for the act to commence 12 months after royal assent or earlier by proclamation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, through the federalisation mechanism, applies the Commonwealth Acts Interpretation Act 1901 for the purpose of uniformly interpreting the agvet codes as applied in each jurisdiction. Also, the Commonwealth administrative law package will apply to the agvet code in each jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to reduce the complexity of the bill, offences will continue to be offences against the laws of the states or territories, although the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions will be empowered to prosecute for offences. This bill repeals the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988, which is replaced by this legislative package. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA>It gives me great pleasure to introduce in the House the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Bill 1993. This bill is to be enacted in the Australian Capital Territory. It has been drafted in complementary adoptive form so that the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code&mdash;the agvet code&mdash;scheduled to the bill can be adopted by each state and the Northern Territory. Through this mechanism, evaluation, registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products and related matters will be administered uniformly across Australia by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. The control measures apply up to the point of retail sale with the states and territories remaining responsible for control of use matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the provisions of the bill. The agvet code focuses on the registration of chemical products, approval of active constituents, and approval of labels.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overriding criteria to be addressed by the NRA are public health, occupational health and safety, the environment, product performance, and trade and commerce. The public will be invited to comment in respect of each chemical product containing a new active constituent prior to determination of an application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRA will also be able to reconsider an existing registered chemical product to ensure it continues to meet contemporary safety and performance standards. The public will be invited to nominate chemical products to be considered for inclusion in this formal and systemic review program. In addition, the NRA will be able to review a chemical product at its own initiative. If appropriate, the NRA may suspend or cancel the registration of a registered chemical product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recognising the cost of additional scientific data when required to support continued chemical registration, compensation provisions have been introduced which will apply in certain circumstances. The intention is to recognise research and development costs associated with updating data packages when such data may also support other manufacturers' products. The provisions will apply to data specifically requested by the NRA and where that data does not have patent protection. A considerable number of safeguards have been built into the agvet code to prevent the commercial abuse of  data while ensuring that both the provider of the call-up data and a secondary applicant are treated equitably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRA will be able to control the possession of chemical products. It will be an offence to supply unregistered chemical products or to supply products in contravention of the conditions of their registration. Where a chemical product has been supplied in contravention of the agvet code, the NRA may issue recall notices requiring persons to stop supplying the product and to take action to deal with unsold stock as directed by the NRA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A system has also been set up under which a person who wishes to do something in respect of a chemical product that would otherwise be an offence may obtain a permit authorising the action to be done. For example, a person may want to conduct a trial or experiment in relation to an unregistered product in order to decide whether to make an application for approval or registration. To ensure chemical products available to the public comply with the specifications determined by the NRA, this bill provides for the licensing of manufacturers of registered chemical products. The introduction of manufacturing principles is to be phased in over a period so as to allow the manufacturing industry time to adjust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRA will have adequate enforcement powers in respect of the agvet code. Authorised inspectors will monitor compliance with the agvet code and, if contraventions are suspected to have occurred, to obtain search warrants. In various circumstances inspectors will be empowered, or may be given powers, to enter and search commercial premises and seize things. An inspector may also require the giving of information or the production of documents. The code also provides that any person may seek an injunction to enforce compliance with the code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To facilitate the NRA being able to seek a wide spectrum of professional advice in respect of its evaluation of chemical products and active constituents, the NRA will be able to release confidential commercial information. However, I emphasise that precautions will be taken to ensure that trade secrets and certain other information subject to possible commercial exploitation are safeguarded. Each person in receipt of confidential commercial information will be bound by the confidentiality provisions of the agvet code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that there are extensive provisions whereby an applicant can have a decision of the NRA reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, including, for example, refusing to grant registration of a chemical product. Before applying to the AAT for a review of decision, an applicant may, if he or she wishes, request the NRA to reconsider the decision at no significant cost to the applicant. If the matter is not resolved, it can be referred to the AAT. These two appeal mechanisms will, I believe, provide a balance between the powers of the NRA and the concerns of applicants. Transitional provisions have been provided which will ensure a smooth transition of existing arrangements to the new agvet code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, I believe, provides for the efficient and timely registration of agricultural and veterinary chemical products. At the same time it will enhance safety standards and consumer confidence by involving the public in the evaluation process which will be accountable, open and transparent. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

This bill amends the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 and the Copyright Act 1968.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislative package extends the functions of the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals&mdash;NRA&mdash;to include the registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products.

Furthermore, the NRA is to have regard to the government's policy in relation to the principles of ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also the NRA will be required to comply with the policies of Commonwealth, state and territory governments that are determined under an agreement to be entered into between those governments for the purpose of this proposed act and the agvet codes. Other major amendments to the Administration Act concern the importation, manufacture and exportation of chemical products. It will be an offence to import a chemical product that is unregistered, not exempted, or for which a permit has not been obtained from the NRA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's international obligations in respect of agricultural and veterinary chemicals are also addressed. This will ensure that Australia can enforce its international obligations under prior informed consent arrangements. The enforcement provisions are very similar to those contained in the agvet code of which details were provided in the second reading speech. The NRA will be able to hold public and private hearings to assist it in the exercise of its functions. The holding of hearings is a strong step towards the NRA's operations being open and transparent, and seen to be such. </PARA>

Honourable members will be aware that, in deciding to participate in the national registration scheme, the government decided that the full cost of the scheme would be recovered from industry, phased in over a four-year period. The National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals will manage the cost recovery program associated with this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy will be a significant component of the scheme's cost recovery program.

<PARA>This bill and the associated bills replace the existing Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981 and amend its associated acts. At this stage I would like the House to note that whenever I mention the word `states' in the rest of this speech I am also including the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing act, which is a consequence of the offshore constitutional settlement, provides the legal framework for the exploration for, and the production of, minerals other than petroleum on Australia's continental shelf that is under Commonwealth jurisdiction. The offshore constitutional settlement divided the jurisdiction over the mineral resources of Australia's continental shelf between the Commonwealth and the states. The states have jurisdiction within coastal waters adjacent to them, while the Commonwealth has jurisdiction from the outer limit of coastal waters to the edge of the continental shelf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the offshore constitutional settlement it was agreed that there would be a common offshore mining code that would apply to the whole of Australia's continental shelf beyond the territorial sea baseline proclaimed by the Commonwealth in 1983. This common offshore mining code will be governed by a package of complementary Commonwealth and state offshore minerals legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revision of the act is a result of the states' dissatisfaction with it and an unwillingness by some states to enact complementary offshore minerals legislation so long as it remained in its present form. They considered that the existing act was not suited to the needs of the offshore minerals industry. The Commonwealth agreed to a comprehensive joint review of the act with the states. Following this review a large number of amendments was agreed to by the ministers of the Australian and New Zealand Minerals and Energy Council in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also took the opportunity to have the legislation rewritten in the plain English style, recently adopted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, to improve its readability so that it could be understood more easily by those who will use it. The end result is that this bill contains many new features in relation to its overall organisation as well as in relation to individual provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the preparation of the bill the Commonwealth closely consulted with the states and in doing so drew on their extensive experience in minerals administration, which has been greatly appreciated. The states at the same time confirmed their commitment to a common offshore minerals code. The bill, when enacted, will provide a model for state complementary offshore minerals legislation which will provide a common mining code to operate in areas under their respective jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the bill extensively modifies the mining code, it preserves those principles in the present act which flow from the offshore constitutional settlement arrangements. Those principles are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">all offshore mineral activity in the Commonwealth area adjacent to a particular state is governed by a joint authority, consisting of the relevant Commonwealth minister and state minister;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">the joint authorities are responsible for major decisions relating to titles, such as grants, refusals and the like and, in the event of a disagreement, the views of the Commonwealth minister prevail;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">the day-to-day administration of the Commonwealth legislation is carried out by the relevant state and they are the primary point of contact between industry and governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this bill deals with rights associated with minerals exploration and exploitation, it ensures that this legislation is consistent with the government's policy in relation to native title. The provisions for the granting of licences are non-discriminatory and administrative procedures, which are already in place, will ensure that Aboriginal interests are consulted when considering applications for any of the licences which may be issued under this act. Operators will be required to respect Aboriginal rights and interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also retains the provision that offshore mineral royalties will be shared 60:40 in favour of the states. This sharing arrangement will apply to all minerals recovered under the authority of the common offshore minerals code. The states retain, and will continue to retain, all fees received from titleholders and applicants for titles. This is a recompense to the states for the expenses incurred in administering the Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is divided into chapters. Chapter 1 covers the usual formalities, the constitutional and political background, the basic principles and concepts flowing from the offshore constitutional settlement, including the establishment of the joint authorities. Chapter 2 is the actual mining code itself, which is written to reflect modern mining administration practice and, because of this, it differs substantially from the cumbersome mining code in the existing act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill clarifies how applications for exploration licences are to be received and treated. As a general rule the applications will be allocated on a first come, first considered basis. The exception to this rule will be where applications for substantially the same area are received at the same time. On such occasions ballots will be used to determine the priority as to which application is to be considered first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill streamlines the existing provisions so that the manner in which an exploration licence is granted is simplified. It also alters the term of exploration licence renewals whereby the initial period will be for four years plus an option of three renewals of two years each. The maximum total term of a licence remains unchanged at 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA>The only major change in the provisions concerning the mining licence is the reduction in the maximum number of blocks from 50 to 20 for each licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the introduction of a new title called a retention licence. This will be an intermediate form of tenure, between an exploration licence and a mining licence. Its primary purpose will be to allow the holder of an exploration licence to retain, for a strictly limited time, title to an area on which a significant deposit has been delineated and evaluated, but which is not a commercially viable proposition in the short term although there is a reasonable prospect for development in the longer term. Under this title the holder will not be able just to sit on the area but will be required to undertake further work according to the conditions laid down by the joint authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill introduces a provision which will require applicants for a title to lodge securities as a condition of title. These securities, which may be varied up or down during the life of a title, will be used to ensure compliance with the legislation, regulations and conditions of the title. The securities may also be used to pay for rectification of any environmental damage as a result of operations, rehabilitation of the title area's environment and the settlement of any outstanding financial obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the creation of an instrument to be called a special purpose consent to undertake scientific investigations and reconnaissance surveys, and to collect small quantities of minerals. The consent will be a non-exclusive authority and it will not give any right or priority should an exploration licence or any other title be applied for later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining chapters of the bill provide for the normal requirements associated with mining administration. Chapter 3 of the bill provides for the keeping of a register and the details that are to be entered into it and so on. It also provides for dealings in licences and authorities and the details of the procedures that are to be followed. Chapter 4 provides the administrative details of the offshore minerals code such as information management, monitoring and enforcement, review of decisions, administrative procedures and finance. Chapter 5 provides for the application of state laws to the offshore area under Commonwealth jurisdiction and miscellaneous matters. The provisions in the five associated bills deal with money matters and are contained in separate bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Offshore Minerals (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1993 amends the associated fees acts. The Offshore Minerals (Retention Licence Fees) Bill 1993 deals with fees payable for retention licences. The Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Amendment Bill 1993 amends the royalty act. The Offshore Minerals (Exploration Licence User Charge) Bill 1993 and the Offshore Minerals (Retention Licence User Charge) Bill 1993 impose user charges on exploration and retention licences as announced in the 1993-94 budget. Discussions are still under way with the states for the establishment of a common offshore minerals royalty system and further amendments to the associated royalty act will be forthcoming at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills provide a modern legal and administrative framework for the offshore mining industry, which will help it grow as the years go by. They are a further demonstration of the government's micro-economic reform program to ensure, in co-operation with the states, that the barriers to the development of Australia's offshore minerals industry are minimised so that it can compete in the tough world trading environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intended that once this legislation package is enacted, the states will introduce complementary offshore minerals legislation to apply within their jurisdiction. This will give effect to the agreement for a common offshore minerals code to apply right round Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main substantive amendment to the acts is the provision for the levels of fees to be set by regulations. This will enable more convenient amendment of the levels of fees when such an amendment is required to reflect the costs of administration of the legislation. The levels of fees have not been amended since 1981 and it is intended that new fees to be set by regulations would double the existing amounts. The intended annual fees are $20 per block for exploration licences, $200 per block for mining licences and $20 per hectare for works licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The registration fee for the transfer or other dealing of an interest in a licence will not be raised and will remain at 1.5 per cent of the value of the dealing. The bill sets a ceiling on the amounts that may be prescribed by regulations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The first of these reports is the committee's annual report of activities for the financial year 1 July 1992 to 30 June 1993. The report continues the practice established by the committee in 1976 of informing the parliament of the committee's activities in the preceding financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The period 1992-93 was a productive one for the committee. It presented seven reports to the parliament. The reports covered a wide range of subjects, including:</PARA>
<PARA>.human resource management in the Australian Public Service;</PARA>
<PARA>.support for private sector research and development activities; and</PARA>
<PARA>.administration and management in a number of Commonwealth organisations&mdash;including the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee has experienced generally good relations with the public sector organisations it dealt with in the year under review. In particular, the Department of Finance and the Australian National Audit Office have continued to assist the committee in its work. Their support has been of great assistance to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second of the reports I am tabling tonight is a compilation of the Department of Finance minutes received by the committee in the 1993 calendar year. As many honourable members will be aware, the Finance minute process is the mechanism by which the government responds to many of the recommendations contained in committee reports. The only recommendations which are not responded to by a Finance minute are those which address policy matters. Recommendations of this nature are responded to separately by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report No. 329 contains copies of the seven Finance minutes received by the committee during 1993. They were Finance minutes dealing with the committee's reports on:</PARA>

All of these Finance minutes, with one exception, were originally tabled in the parliament without comment by the committee. The exception was the Finance minute on the Midford Paramount case. The Finance minute on the Midford Paramount case was tabled on 28 November 1993, together with extensive comments by the committee. The committee's comments addressed, in particular, the views expressed by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in an appendix to the Finance minute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Usually, I am willing to thank the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), for being less loquacious, but tonight is one of the few occasions on which I wish he had talked for longer. Having said that, I apologise to the House for being late for the presentation of this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few remarks about the conference that was held here in Canberra. Mr Speaker, first, I would like to congratulate all the officers of the parliament and, in particular, Ann Hazelton, the coordinator of the conference, for the work they did in putting this conference together earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was a singular honour for Australia to host the IPU conference. It has been a very good thing for this parliament in the eyes of parliaments around the world. Indeed, last week I attended a meeting of the IPU executive in Geneva where there was unanimous commentary that the conference we held here was one of the best in recent years. The view was that our colleagues in France who will host the conference in March next year will have a lot to keep up with if their conference is to be as good as the conference that was held here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of important issues were canvassed at the conference. A number of friendships were made by people in Australia with delegates from around the world. I know that the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) will also have some things to say about the conference. From the point of view of the delegation, Mr Speaker, the work that you did as chairman of the conference is to be commended. I think this conference showed the world a lot of interesting and different things about Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that we had Lois O'Donoghue, the Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, address the opening showed the world what a different perspective Australia had. The fact that we were able to accommodate all the delegates in this parliament and the fact that a whole range of members were willing to entertain, talk to and have various bilateral meetings with people I think ensured that Australia came out of that conference in a very good light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank you, Mr Speaker, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) for the funds provided for the Australian delegation, of which I was the leader, to entertain our colleagues from the Asia-Pacific region at a dinner during the conference. I think that attracted some considerable credit for Australia. It was an excellent evening that all those delegates and the Australian contingent enjoyed. It built up a level of camaraderie which I think was good for all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues canvassed at the conference allowed politicians from Australia and around the world to get a view of where parliaments stand and where we as individuals see our position. There is no doubt that some people in the press in Australia attacked the conference as being a bit of a talkfest, which I think is a rather stupid, insular approach to take. By attacking it as a talkfest they missed the point. One of the important things about these types of conferences is that it is the friendships that people make which allow people from other parliaments, when they go back to their home parliaments, to remember us in Australia, and it allows us as Australian members of parliament to get a personal perspective on where people from other parts of the world come from. I think that the IPU, which has about 130 parliaments as its affiliates, is probably the best forum for members of parliament to work out what they feel about their colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I talked about the organisation of the conference and the work that Ann Hazelton did. I think over the two or three years of the planning for the conference Ann started out in some sort of panic that she might not have been able to do it. As you and others have said, Mr Speaker, she represented this parliament very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the honourable member for Moncrieff was the Chairperson of the Meeting of Women Parliamentarians was also a credit to Australia. As I said, I recently went to an executive meeting in Geneva. The three women members of the executive were unanimous in their praise for the way that that meeting was organised here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the Australian Labor Party, and no doubt the coalition, the IPU is working towards having parity between male and female members. The IPU has a special committee on parity with the goal of trying to ensure that there are far more women represented at IPU meetings. I suppose in some ways I am a bit sad in that there is obviously a larger representation of women at IPU meetings than there is in this House of Representatives but, hopefully, in the short term, both sides of parliament here might accommodate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing is that while the IPU has a parity committee on membership, without being too difficult with the Clerk, the parity has not worked with the officials as the IPU still has all male officials&mdash;as does the SES, with one exception in the Department of the House of Representatives. That one exception has at least broken the ice a little. I know that Mr Barlin is committed to the fact that we should be promoting people on ability rather than anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference here in Australia was a good one for Australia; it was a good one for the IPU and, in my view, the Australian delegation acquitted itself very well. In particular, the people who work for the parliament here, from Mr Barlin, Mr Templeton and Mr Evans down, showed that the professionalism that we have in this place is better&mdash;it is not as good as, it is better than anywhere else in the world. The last conference was a credit to those people, and we as the delegates and you as the Speaker can all bask in the glory that they caused to be reflected upon us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the delegation's report. I know that my colleague the deputy leader, the honourable member for Moncrieff, will have some things to say. She keeps looking at the clock thinking I have eaten into her time, but we both now realise that even though we have a notional 10 minutes the clock is not working, so she can talk for 15 or 20 minutes. I had better sit down because I have probably already spoken for 10 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the House and the members of the delegation for the support that they gave. I thank you, Mr Speaker, for the way in which you conducted the conference.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am grateful to you, Mr Speaker, for pointing out that important point. As the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) mentioned, there was a notional limit of 10 minutes on this debate which is about to expire in about 10 seconds. However, we did have an agreement we would have five minutes each, so I hope, Mr Speaker, you will give me a little more than 10 seconds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On an earlier occasion, immediately after the conference, some statements were made in this House with respect to the conference. I made some comments about the staff, the support that we received and how the conference went. I hope that those interested in my views on that will look at that speech. There are some things I want to say in relation to the IPU and this report, with a little help from my frontbench, this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the last conference that I shall attend as the representative of Australia. Over the last three years I have attended conferences as the opposition so-called permanent delegate; that is, together with one government representative I have been the person who attended all conferences in the life of one parliament. It is my obligation now to retire, somewhat sadly I might say. Nevertheless, it has been a wonderful experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of things I want to point out to the Australian parliament and put on record. I think Australia has a unique and very important role to play at IPU conferences, not least because we operate within the Asia-Pacific group. There are actually only three Pacific countries which attend the IPU&mdash;Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Australia and New Zealand are the only countries which attend every conference of the IPU. I in particular was aware of that fact in attending conferences. I felt that there was a particular obligation on Australia&mdash;New Zealand of course picked up this obligation too&mdash;to make sure that the interests of the Pacific were properly represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We operate within the Asia-Pacific group, as well as the so-called Twelve Plus Group, which is the western European democracies. Australia and New Zealand are the only two western European style democracies which are members of the Asia-Pacific group and, as I said, together with Papua New Guinea are the only Pacific countries to attend. The Asian countries are enormously significant. Geographically they range from Iran through to Japan, and include giants such as India and China as well as the other Asian countries that one would expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore incumbent on Australia to make sure that the Pacific's interests are reflected at the IPU conferences, and we did that through the Asia-Pacific meetings and through our participation on drafting committees. Australia is very active on the committees that draft the resolutions voted on at the end of a conference. A couple of the drafting subjects had very particular relevance to the Pacific. At the first conference I attended, which was in Uruguay, I was on a drafting committee concerned with the subject of colonialism. On another we were involved with the subject of the environment, which had very particular significance to the Pacific because of concerns about long-line fishermen in Japan. Obviously, at times there are inherent conflicts within the Asia-Pacific group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that, on behalf of Australia, I was successful in raising AIDS as a supplementary item for discussion at a conference in Cameroon. The subject of AIDS is one of great significance to a number of Asian countries, but while China, Thailand and India were very strong in their support for making AIDS an item for discussion Japan was very strong in its opposition to it. That is a subject for another day. Nevertheless, Australia has been very active in promoting issues of significance to the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference held at Canberra in September was an opportunity for the promotion of Australia. I pay tribute to the honourable member for Watson for the efforts he made to bring the conference to Australia. I might add that there was not any opposition to its coming to Australia. In fact, I can remember conferences where we were approached by people asking, `Could you have it there sooner?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst hosting a conference is expensive, it provides a great opportunity for promotion of the host country. It promotes goodwill amongst all the visiting countries, and it promotes a sense of parliamentary process. I am sure that the fact that the conference was held here meant that a number of countries who possibly need to sharpen up their democratic instincts went away with a better idea of how a parliamentary system works within a democratic context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to refer to the pre-conference meeting of women members of parliament. The colour photograph on the cover of the IPU report shows a meeting of the women MPs. Nobody has mentioned this, but the woman in red, sitting at the head table&mdash;just to the left of where the clerk is sitting at the moment&mdash;is me. I am very grateful for being accorded the opportunity to chair that meeting. It was of great assistance to the meeting that day that there was a woman in the chair who had actually attended previous IPU conferences. Traditionally, the pre-conference meeting is chaired by the most senior woman MP from the host country. In my experience, that had always been a woman who had not previously attended an IPU conference and consequently did not know what was required on the day. It was of very great help to me and to the meeting that I had been to previous conferences, and I hope it is a practice that future IPU conferences will follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was, of course, the first woman MP to be appointed a permanent member of Australia's delegation to the IPU. I had hoped that the government would follow suit in time. There are women from the government side who have attended IPU conferences in the time that I have been a delegate, and I particularly mention Senator Reynolds and the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio)&mdash;it was great to have them along&mdash;and Senator Reid, who was a member of our delegation last time. I hope that both government and opposition&mdash;particularly the government&mdash;take the opportunity to include women amongst their delegations in this forthcoming parliament. The opposition probably feels that it has at least done its duty in that respect for the last parliament. As for the future, it is a matter of who nominates for the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to convey my thanks to some members of staff whom I have not mentioned on previous occasions. John Dyer was a great support to the delegation in the time that I have been connected with it. While he is no longer the secretary to the delegation, he was on the last occasion that it met. Then there is Pam Macdonald, the new Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade support person, and Bill Neilson, who preceded her in that position. The foreign affairs people have been a great support. They get all sorts of curly things thrown at them at these conferences without any warning or preparation time, yet they always measure up in a very professional way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, having extended my time by a minute or two, as part of my swan song I thank you for your role in the conference. It was much admired. You certainly rose to the occasion, even though you were there on short notice. It was an excellent conference all round. I extend my very best wishes to all future Australian parliamentary delegates to IPU conferences. They are a very important fora for Australia. There is a proud tradition associated with them, which I did my very best to uphold and which I am sure future delegates will work equally hard to uphold. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the main purpose of the delegation was to strengthen relations between the Australian parliament and parliaments in the countries visited and to advance the knowledge of these countries by our delegation members. I am pleased to report that in achieving these objectives the delegation was a great success.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In every country visited our host was the Speaker of the national parliament, who offered us generous hospitality and every opportunity to appreciate all aspects of parliamentary activities. This personal interest by the Speaker ensured that everything went smoothly and emphasised the common interests of parliamentarians elsewhere. It was obvious from our contacts with the different Speakers and members that the Australian parliament, as an institution, is well regarded in the Pacific islands and that delegations such as our own foster this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all countries we also had discussions with ministers and senior officials, and in four countries we visited the head of government. This enabled delegation members to increase their knowledge and appreciation of the achievements of each country and of the challenges facing them. The delegation did not, however, confine its activities to talks with leaders. In every country, we visited Australian aid projects and commercial developments outside of the capital and had the opportunity to talk with local workers and villagers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation spent its longest time in Papua New Guinea. This was appropriate, because PNG is the largest Pacific island country and is also the one with which Australia has the closest historical and traditional links. In PNG our host was the Speaker, Bill Skate, who personally welcomed us and ensured that we saw as much as possible of parliamentary operations and of their most impressive parliament house. In PNG, however, at our own request we spent most of our time in regional centres rather than in the capital, Port Moresby. During this time we were accompanied by the Deputy Speaker, Ben Okoro, whose reputation and presence resulted in this part of our visit being what I personally regard as a highlight of my time as a member of parliament. In these regional centres of PNG we were also fortunate to be the guests of provincial parliaments and administrations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Links between the Australian and PNG people are particularly strong and affectionate. To an older generation of Australians there are memories largely based on the Second World War and the tenderness and compassion of the famous fuzzy wuzzy angels, which will always be part of Australia's heritage. Australia continues to be indebted to the PNG people for this assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation visited the two largest Australian war cemeteries in PNG, which are a moving testimony to these links. However, with generational change and personal memories fading, it is essential that these links be confirmed and maintained. On the parliamentary level, this could best be achieved by continuing and up-grading parliamentary delegations such as our own. In particular, Australia's relationship with PNG is sufficiently important for delegations that visit only that country. Also, because of what we believe is the special relationship between Australia and PNG, the delegation suggests that the committee exchange program which at present operates between the Australian and New Zealand parliaments should be extended to the PNG parliament. This would be an appropriate recognition of that special relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from parliamentary matters, Australian aid was probably the most discussed topic in our talks in PNG. At present, there is considerable debate in Australia and elsewhere about the merits of budgetary aid as opposed to aid for individual projects. In PNG, following discussions with both PNG nationals and Australian expatriates and observations of a number of aid projects, we concluded that project aid was effective and efficient. However, the delegation recognises that the eventual mix of aid is a matter for the Australian and PNG governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is also aware of some debate in Australia about the situation in Bougainville. While we did not visit that island, our discussions led us to believe that the Australian position on the Bougainville issue was accepted and appreciated by PNG. Here again, this is a matter for our respective governments rather than parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter which the delegation wishes to raise in respect of PNG is the position of Australian business. In all parts of PNG which we visited, New Zealand business houses were strongly competing for the market. The delegation wishes to point out the opportunities for Australian business in PNG, where participation results in our mutual advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After PNG the delegation visited the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. In both of these countries we were honoured to be the first Australian parliamentary delegation. This was a considerable privilege for the delegation. In the FSM, we were the guests of Speaker Jack Fritz and in the Marshall Islands of Speaker Kessai Note, both of whom showed the delegation marvellous hospitality. The warmth of our reception in these two countries was particularly gratifying, not only because we were the first Australian parliamentary delegation but also because neither the FSM nor the RMI have the same traditional links with Australia as the other countries visited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, on the parliamentary level, the visits were very satisfactory. The FSM was the only country we visited with a federal constitutional system, so there was much to see and to compare. In the RMI we visited the new parliament complex, known as the Nitijela, which was just being completed. The delegation is pleased to report that, as a result of its initiative, Australia was able to provide a speaker's chair for the new chamber. We thank you, Mr Speaker, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), for your assistance in delivering that chair to the new parliament of the Marshall Islands. The delegation believes that it is important that the Australian parliament builds on the goodwill towards Australia evident in the FSM and RMI by instituting regular parliamentary exchanges and by other contacts, both regional and bilateral, which emphasise the role of parliament. This is already being maintained with the delegation led by the President of the Marshall Islands visiting Australia last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from parliamentary matters, while in the FSM and RMI the delegation mainly discussed development and the environment. Both these countries consist of a number of scattered island groups, which presents particular problems for economic development. Both countries, however, are meeting this challenge in appropriate ways. The environment also presents challenges, particularly for the RMI. Whereas the FSM consists of island groups which are largely volcanic, with steep mountains and fertile soil, the RMI consists of coral atolls scarcely one metre above sea level. Thus, any continuance of global warming and a consequent rise in the sea level would have the most serious consequences for the RMI. The committee visited an Australian aid project which monitored this process and suggests that this type of project is a most appropriate use of Australian aid resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the delegation visited Western Samoa and Tonga, both of which have ties to Australia resulting from relative geographic proximity, membership of regional organisations and, increasingly, the island communities resident in Australia. A number of Australian parliamentary delegations have previously visited these two countries and it was a privilege and a pleasure to continue and expand these contacts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Samoa we were the guest of Speaker Afamasaga Fatu Vaili, who showed us great personal kindness, particularly in enabling us to experience traditional village culture. In Tonga our host was Speaker Fusitu'a. I am pleased to acknowledge that the Tongan Speaker is in Australia at the moment. He was in the parliament earlier today. I, with other members of parliament, was pleased to enjoy a meal with the delegation this evening. I acknowledge the presence of our Tongan parliamentary friends in the gallery this evening. The hospitality extended by the Speaker and our friends in Tonga was similarly generous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tonga we also witnessed the great strengths of traditional values. In addition, one of my local friends, Joel Mafi, a Tongan, was able to visit Tonga while I was there and so I had the opportunity to visit some of his friends and relatives in Tonga to give me a much closer first-hand knowledge of life there. In both these countries, there was considerable discussion of the vibrant Western Samoan and Tongan communities which contribute much to Australian life. I acknowledge that I have a large Western Samoan community in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major highlight in both Western Samoa and Tonga was a visit to the headquarters of an important regional organisation. In Western Samoa this was the South Pacific Regional Environment Program, an autonomous intergovernmental organisation. Its function is to encourage sustainable development in its Pacific island members. In Tonga it was the South Pacific Alliance for Family Health, which is a non-governmental organisation addressing women's health issues in the Pacific. Australia makes a substantial contribution to both organisations, which do effective work. Australia should further assist the operations of such regional bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the South Pacific Alliance for Family Health was doing a tremendous job right throughout the South Pacific. In light of an earlier paper today by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), I think it is very important to highlight where our aid is assisting in that area. I congratulate everyone associated with that organisation in Tonga because of the good work that it is doing in family health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all the countries visited, our talks with ministers and other leaders covered a wide variety of topics. As indicated earlier, aid, development and the environment were important everywhere. Health, education and training were also areas of crucial importance to the Pacific island nations. There were, however, other major issues which often were relevant to contemporary debate in Australia. For instance, the delegation discussed constitutional change and development, the processes of which varied considerably when compared to both Australia and the countries in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national heritage of our respective countries was also an important topic. In this context, the delegation noted the strength of traditional island cultures and the central importance of native land-holdings in this continuing tradition. Given the current debate in Australia on the native title legislation, this was of particular interest to members of the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three of the countries visited&mdash;PNG, Western Samoa and Tonga&mdash;are already, with Australia, members of a number of regional organisations. Due to geographical and historical factors, the FSM and the RMI are less familiar members of regional bodies to which Australia also belongs. The delegation believes that regional bodies in the Pacific islands seem a particularly appropriate and effective means to meet common challenges, such as environmental change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On another aspect of Australia's regional and aid programs, national leaders in all the countries visited expressed their satisfaction and appreciation of the appointment of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney). I think that we were the first parliamentary delegation to visit Pacific island states since this appointment and I can report the considerable interest and gratification shown in those countries at what was seen as an important new focus for Australia. The minister had already had extensive talks and discussions in many of the areas visited and the delegation can report directly to parliament that this appointment will be of great benefit to Australia's regional objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation was greatly assisted by Australia's representatives in the countries which we visited. These representatives include high commissioners Bill Farmer in Papua New Guinea, David Ritchie in Western Samoa and Jennifer Rawson in Tonga, and Ambassador Peter Stanford in the FSM and the RMI. The delegation considers that the quality of our representation is high and that Australian resources in these areas should be maintained at least at their present levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to thank the other members of the delegation: the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who is in the chamber tonight and was the deputy leader of the delegation; Senator John Coulter, senator for South Australia; and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick), who is also in the chamber this evening. I would also like to thank Mrs Kaye Charles, the wife of the honourable member for La Trobe, who accompanied the delegation in Western Samoa and Tonga. She was of great assistance at a number of our official functions and I offer our thanks to Kaye for this helpful assistance and friendship. David Creed was the hard working secretary to the delegation and I thank him for his assistance on the delegation and on the drafting of this report. It is certainly my pleasure to table this report this evening and commend it to members of parliament for their reading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to thank the parliament of Australia for giving me the opportunity to participate in this delegation. For me it was a truly eye-opening experience. I told a number of our guests at several functions during our tour of five Pacific island nations that it seemed to me that Australia had always viewed itself as a piece of Europe transposed somehow magically into the South Pacific and operating in a European environment in the location in which we find ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For me, it was an opportunity to view the globe&mdash;or, if you will, the atlas&mdash;from a different perspective: the real perspective of meeting real people in the real community in which we live and in which we must operate. It does seem to me that, increasingly, Australia is demonstrating to the people of the region, not only in Asia and South-East Asia but also to the many small island nations in the Pacific, that we belong here, we live here and we consider that we really are part of this region and so are they. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the parliament for giving me the opportunity of putting the two-dimensional layout that one sees on a map into perspective as a three-dimensional reality of people and places. My mind now locates Australia so very much more accurately than it did before we left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take the opportunity to thank the parliaments, the parliamentarians, the leaders and the people of Papua New Guinea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Western Samoa and, last but certainly not least, Tonga. They opened their hearts to us. They showed us the way that they live. They showed us the way that their very different parliaments and democratic systems operate. They were willing to share with us their needs and the kinds of things that Australia could do to help them. They were willing to share with us their homes, their food and their hospitality. We all thank them. It was a great learning experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a hardworking delegation. From time to time, we hear in the electorates that the politicians have gone off on another junket. The people in the gallery and the people listening to this broadcast might be interested to know that it actually is hard work. From the best of my recollection, I think we had half a day off in four weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was one stretch when I think we got up at 5.30 in the morning in Lae, on the north coast of Papua New Guinea, flew to Moresby, had a series of meetings there and then had a lunch where we met and talked with some members of parliament as well as business leaders and some of the bureaucracy of Papua New Guinea. We then got on a plane and flew to Brisbane. We sat on the ground in Brisbane for 5 1/2 hours. We then got on a plane and flew to Guam where we sat on the ground for 3 1/2 hours. We then got on a plane and flew to Truk and from Truk to Pohnpei in Micronesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Pohnpei we were met with a brass band, dancing girls, the delegation and the mayor&mdash;the lot. We immediately took our bags to our accommodation and went to a series of meetings with ministers and heads of various state departments. That evening, immediately after we finished the last meeting, we went to a state dinner hosted by the President. By the time we got to bed, we had been up for 47 hours straight. So those listening who believe that these junkets are not worth while to Australia or believe that parliamentarians do not work while they are away might take heed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We received magnificent hospitality. I took the liberty of bringing what some might have viewed as an offensive weapon, but which is in fact a lovely ceremonial sword which was presented to me by the citizens and the local regional government of Wewak on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is absolutely magnificent. That demonstrates very clearly to me the friendship displayed to us as Australians by our hosts in every country that we visited. It was particularly interesting for me, with my sometimes twangy accent, in Papua New Guinea. The Papua New Guineans thought it was really quite remarkable that one who had been born in the United States was in fact a member of the House of Representatives of Australia. But they accepted me as an Australian, as they accepted all of us, and really were tremendous hosts. We learned a great deal about our region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be remiss of me to not advise the House and those who are listening that during our visit to Western Samoa the leader of our delegation, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), had the great honour bestowed on him of being made a chief&mdash;Chief Tuia-Anafuaoletauola, Chief Scott. It was a tremendous ceremony. We learned a great deal about local customs. It was a great honour bestowed on our delegation and on Australia. I have photographs of the honourable member, for anyone who is interested. I can say that they are absolutely remarkable. I believe that, as the honourable member was led out to change clothes for the ceremony, he was heard to say, `Oh, Bob Charles is going to love this'. The honourable member was something to behold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the ceremony the honourable member for Oxley sat in his chair, sort of naked from the waist up with a pink flower behind one ear, and there was the pig on the concrete in front of him with a flower behind its ear. Some of us wondered which was the pig and which was the honourable member. They both had flowers. It was very nice, and a great honour to the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of our hosts were terrific hosts. All of the nations that we visited were particularly complimentary about Australia's aid program and Australia's approach to them. I thought that was fantastic. For instance, in the Federated States of Micronesia, even though their economy is dominated by American aid, they nonetheless seemed to appreciate more the small amount of help that Australia was able to give because of the manner in which it was given and the directions in which it was applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our patrol boats are particularly well received throughout the South Pacific. Micronesia was also interesting in that regard. Its parliament told us that it had some concerns about the patrol boats when they were first offered because they had thought, `We may not be able to afford to meet the cost of running them and maintaining them'. But in fact within several months the Micronesians caught a Japanese fishing boat, I believe, fishing illegally and by the time they had finished with the Japanese in court they had $750,000 in the federal coffers. Several months later, they captured an illegal Indonesian fishing boat. That one cost the Indonesians $1.3 million. At the time of our visit they thought patrol boats were the best thing since sliced bread. They were absolutely delighted with the patrol boats. It is interesting that we seem to have shifted the illegal fishermen from the south of the Pacific to the north. They have moved north as the patrol boats, in conjunction with Orions, have really taken over servicing the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues on the delegation. The honourable member for Oxley was an excellent leader. I enjoyed the company of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick) and Senator Coulter as well. I thank the honourable member for Oxley for his kind words to my wife and I will pass his message along to her. My thanks go to all of our ambassadors and trade commissioners in the various countries that we visited for their assistance, their advice and their hospitality. I thank our hosts and I particularly thank the delegation secretary, Mr David Creed. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our tour of Papua New Guinea was highlighted by visits to Port Moresby, Weewak, Madang and Lae. Each area was different in its cultural, geographic and economic aspects. Talks with provincial ministers enabled us to understand the enormous problems associated with providing remote areas of that country with adequate health, education and community services. Our visits to several Australian war cemeteries&mdash;beautifully maintained by local people&mdash;helped us to realise the enormous sacrifices made by Australian servicemen and women in this part of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill is about correcting drafting mistakes found in earlier legislation. It is a terrible shame that honourable members' time is being wasted unnecessarily, when so many bills are being pushed through the House at a rate of knots, and that honourable members are now merely correcting drafting mistakes which the government could have got right in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parts 2 and 6 of this bill make relatively minor changes to legislation governing the aged care program. These changes&mdash;which commence on the date of royal assent&mdash;will have no financial impact. Part 2 would make it an offence to make false or misleading statements, knowingly or recklessly, in support of various applications or submissions made under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act. This particular part of the principal act relates to Commonwealth subsidies for hostels and community aged care packages. Applications that are included in the proposed section include applications for financial assistance, for an approval for a service, for an approval to transfer a service, or for an approval as an approved operator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The offence also extends to documents given to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe), unless it is indicated that the document contains false or misleading information and reasonable steps are taken to provide the correct information to the minister. The maximum penalty laid down in the legislation is five years imprisonment. It would be an offence, with a similar penalty, if false or misleading statements were made in relation to a submission seeking to contest a ministerial decision to revoke an approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the proposed sections which would introduce an important safeguard into the parent act. Until now there has been a need to rely on general offences under the Crimes Act. Part 6 of the bill provides that nursing home records which are required for the verification of claims for Commonwealth benefits under the National Health Act shall be retained for seven financial years. This seven-year requirement would also apply to any other records that the secretary requires a proprietor to keep as a result of serving a notice in writing. The seven-year financial period will commence on 1 July after the financial year to which the records relate. It applies to records held at the date of royal assent, and finishes on 30 June seven years later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The penalty for not keeping such records for seven financial years is 200 so-called penalty units. This issue of penalty units is unusual&mdash;a new concept in this country. Australians are used to having to pay fines defined in currency. I understand that the move towards the use of penalty points in Australian laws commenced in Victoria in 1981, and that Queensland and New South Wales have introduced similar systems. Amendments made last year to sections 4AA and 4BB of the Crimes Act introduced a penalty unit with a monetary value of $100. The base unit is specified in sections 4AA and 4AB of the Crimes Act 1914. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relating penalties to a central reference point in the Crimes Act means that the government does not continually have to update the value of penalties in a large number of relevant Commonwealth acts. I might point out that this is not much consolation to a nursing home proprietor who has no idea of the definition or monetary value of a penalty unit. What would be useful to assist these busy people would be information on where to find the relevant information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate the coalition successfully moved an amendment to section 18A regarding those penalty units. The amendment secured in the bill states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a section of the Principal Act refers to a penalty in terms of penalty units, a note is to be added at the end of each such section in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`For the definition and value of a penalty unit, see section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914'</PARA>
<PARA>The maximum penalty of 200 units is double the maximum penalty for a breach of the general retention provisions for nursing homes under section 61 of the National Health Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate debate on this bill the coalition questioned why the maximum penalties in relation to the retention of records increased from $1,000 in 1991 to the equivalent of $20,000 in 1993. One has to query what criteria were used to decide the appropriate penalty. That is a huge jump in anyone's view&mdash;from $1,000 in 1991 to $20,000 in 1993. Following the Senate debate, a letter to the shadow minister for senior citizens and aged care, Senator Patterson, from the minister advised only that the 200 penalty units specified in subsection 61(4A) were set on the advice of officers of the Attorney-General's Department. Nevertheless, the coalition concurs with the government on the matter of retaining records for seven years, which is normal bookkeeping practice for businesses for tax claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the coalition will not be opposing the bill as a whole, we are nevertheless concerned about the long and protracted delays in validating nursing and personal care funding to nursing homes since the inception of the new funding system in 1987. Major concerns have also been expressed by representatives of both community based and private sector nursing homes about the government's conduct of nursing home validations. As a result, the matter was referred to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs. When the preliminary report was presented to the Senate, Senator Patterson stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, every nursing home proprietor must have an undeniable right to a timely validation that is prospectively applied in accordance with a consistently defined and interpreted set of guidelines by validation teams acting in a professional manner . . . In its preliminary report, the Committee concludes that the validation process is a crucial part of the restructuring of nursing home funding and that it is not prepared to recommend its interruption while investigations are being carried out. </PARA>
<PARA>The main concerns are therefore those of timeliness, and the prospective application of funding criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the bill corrects two drafting errors in the National Health Act 1952 caused by the passage of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment (No. 2) Act 1992. The changes are relatively minor. The most substantial of them relates to the secrecy provisions in the Health Insurance Act. As honourable members would be well aware, departmental officers often receive requests for information about public and private hospitals. The information sought includes names and addresses of hospitals, bed capacity, kinds of services provided, teaching status and whether the hospitals are public or private. Under current legislation this information is readily available in the public domain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 16 allows an authorised officer to release certain specified information about hospitals. Given that the information is available in the public domain, the coalition will not oppose this clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank the opposition for supporting the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now that we are an hour ahead of the guillotine, we might be able to facilitate matters by dispensing with this matter quickly before the other two speakers arrive! We are discussing the Migration Amendment ("Points" System) Bill 1993. What I am going to say might excite the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) to stay on. The explanatory memorandum to the bill states that this bill:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">simplifies the operation of the points system and pooling mechanism provided for in . . . the Migration Act 1958. The points system and pooling mechanism are essentially program control measures designed to enable efficient management of changes in total migration program numbers in the independent and concessional family categories.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, those categories are those which are most clearly able to test people's skills and abilities for entry to Australia and, for that reason, are particularly important because the only other category in which there may be some element of skilling required is that in relation to the entry under nomination by employers and the like. This bill is designed to replace the three-mark system currently in operation with a two-mark system consisting of a pass mark and a pool mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I imagine that at this point we would be losing anybody who is unfamiliar with the operations of our immigration scheme. It is important to recognise that, in relation to the system in which we have been operating where people are required to obtain a pass mark to be accepted for migrant entry, it is a pass mark which is assessed on the basis of a person's skill, age and education. If the person is nominated by a family member, it includes whether or not those family members have been employed. It also relates to whether those family members are citizens of Australia. In other words, we are looking at a range of factors which enable us to make an assessment of the large numbers of people who would like to migrate to Australia in the independent and concessional family categories and to choose those who are more likely to settle well in Australia over time and those who have the personal characteristics which it is judged will facilitate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under these new arrangements, a qualifying score will be set by the government of the day. It will do so by regulations which will have to be met by applicants. Following an assessment of the prescribed qualifications of an applicant in one of the relevant classes of visa that people have to satisfy, an applicant's score will be compared with the pass mark and the pool mark which have been notified before. There can be one of three outcomes, we are told, if we read carefully the explanatory memorandum. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) An applicant who achieves a score that is more than, or equal to, the notified pass mark . . . is taken to have received the qualifying score and is entitled to move on to the next stage of processing.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that usually relates to character and health checking. The explanatory memorandum continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) An applicant whose assessed score is less than the notified pool mark is taken not to have received the qualifying score with the consequence that the application must be rejected . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The third outcome reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If an applicant's assessed score is more than, or equal to, the notified pool mark but less than the notified pass mark, the application is taken to have been put into a pool.</PARA>
<PARA>The explanatory memorandum continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains detailed arrangements regarding the manner in which applications in the pool are to be dealt with. Specifically, the Minister is required to compare the applicant's assessed score with any variations in the pass mark or in the pool mark, during the 12 month period following the assessment of the applicant's assessed score. The Bill makes it clear, however, that the Minister is not to re-assess the applicant's assessed score every time a variation is published and a comparison with the new mark is made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Depending on the outcome of any comparison of an applicant's assessed score against a varied mark the application will, in a manner similar to that outlined above in respect of the initial application of the points system, either be entitled to move on to the next stage for processing, be rejected, or remain in the pool. Once an application has remained in the pool for a period of 12 months following the assessment of the applicant's score, the applicant is taken not to have received the qualifying score and the application must be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This process streamlines the management of applications which have been pooled by replacing the current arrangements of three pass mark reconsiderations and by incorporating a clear statement which sets out the circumstances and the timeframe within which applications are removed from the pool.</PARA>
<PARA>The bill also makes some technical amendments mainly because of the introduction of the Migration Reform Act and some changes that are made there. These are technical amendments to bring the new bill into line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members that the points system for independent and concessional entry for migration was introduced in 1989. It followed the extensive reforms implemented after what is known as the FitzGerald report. The system was introduced to enable effective control of the numbers approved for entry into Australia. Essentially, it was to enable the government of the day to determine a total program in advance and then to try to bring in the specified numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these two categories, that is, the independent and concessional family categories, there was some capacity to make variations whereas each of the other categories&mdash;employer nomination, very often in relation to the business migration program as it was, and the preferential family stream&mdash;was what was called demand driven. When dealing with preferential family we had to eventually accept all of the spouses, for instance, that qualified for entry under the test that had been specified. If more spouses applied in that year, there was no flexibility to reduce the rest of the program unless there was something similar to this floating pass mark in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this system was introduced it was well understood that it was an important control mechanism. I notice a particularly interesting comment in the second reading speech by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh). In the scheme as it was operating before&mdash;the three-tier system, as I have identified&mdash;where the number of successful applicants was inconsistent with the program planning levels, it was possible to lower the priority pass mark to allow more applicants to move to the next stage of processing. If there were a shortfall in the number of places to be filled, the pass mark could be lowered and a large number of people could be brought in very easily. That is fairly clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was found that, when the numbers had to be reduced, the program was not so successful. That is essentially what the minister was saying to us. To lower the numbers of people in the pool was not possible because of the timelags and the requirement that people who had already been entered into the pool were there. They were difficulties associated with the management of the pool operation. It seems to me that it is appropriate to ensure that the system is able to be better managed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I wonder, as I do with most of these things, even though I might come somewhat innocently to these issues, whether there are some underlying reasons for the changes. I am merely speculating when I raise these matters, but it is interesting that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) has foreshadowed recently that the numbers in the immigration program may have to rise. Given the suggestion that the numbers in the program accepted for entry may rise at a time when the government has significantly reduced the migration program over time, one could be forgiven for wondering whether the minister for immigration is better able to predict what might happen to the Australian economy than some of his economic ministers. Maybe he is suggesting that the economy will grow and unemployment will fall so significantly that one would want to increase the migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He may have in mind that there are skills that we require in Australia that we cannot obtain without increasing the numbers in the migration program, but it sits a bit uncomfortably with some of the other matters that we have been considering of late such as the government's statement on unemployment in Australia at this time. A very interesting library paper has recorded that unemployment in Australia is at record levels. It is at its highest level in percentage terms since the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could be forgiven for wondering why the numbers in the immigration program need to increase at this time when we look at the circumstances that led to the reduction that the government undertook and the largely unchanged situation in employment. I wonder what some of the other factors are that might be influencing the government to look at a more flexible way of managing the pool. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not hear what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services said. It may have something to do with the fact that the government has in mind to make some changes to the humanitarian stream. That will have some significant consequences over time in relation to each of the other categories. That may be the reason that we need to be able to make some changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the government managed to get an election out of the way, it managed to leave the humanitarian issues, those people making claims for humanitarian consideration, largely in abeyance. That was the situation. While the government agonised over whether they were substantial claims, those people were left hanging out there, for base political reasons. The government got the election out of the way and then it was able to make the decision comfortably to allow the approximately 20,000 students from the People's Republic of China permanent entry. The fact is that their relatives, in some 7,000 to 9,000 cases, are already here. The government then made a decision to allow, albeit under some tested provisions, all of the other people to stay in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, they are fairly questionable provisions because they will force all of the Chinese PhD students who have been in Australia to leave while all of those who came under the ELICOS schemes, without a substantial education before they arrived in the majority of cases, will be allowed to stay permanently if they satisfy the criteria. That is a pretty poor choice in the way in which the government has tried to deal with the matter. That scheme will allow perhaps another 14,000 or 15,000 people&mdash;large numbers of them from the People's Republic of China, some from Sri Lanka, some from the former republic of Yugoslavia and maybe some others who have made claims for refugee status&mdash;to stay permanently, unlike the situation before where they might have been granted only a four-year temporary entry permit. To understand the linkage, every one of those people will become a permanent resident of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens when those people have obtained permanent residency is that they have a capacity to sponsor other family members under the preferential family stream or under the concessional arrangements which are the subject of the points testing arrangements. These changes that are being made to policy have the potential to increase significantly the numbers of people who can apply under both of those categories that I have spoken about&mdash;the preferential stream and the concessional family stream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the parliamentary secretary will explain whether or not the linkages that are there are in part the reason for requiring a capacity to reduce&mdash;that is what the government is seeking&mdash;the numbers of people who will be admitted through the pool. If the parliamentary secretary reads again the minister's second reading speech, she will find that it is quite clear that the problem with the scheme as it operated was that the numbers could be increased quite easily but the numbers could not be decreased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we are being asked to approve&mdash;and we do; we are not opposing the bill, I make that clear&mdash;is a situation which will give that flexibility. At the end of the day the government makes the decisions in relation to these matters. I know and understand that principle. But it is important that, in relation to this issue, the people of Australia understand why decisions are being taken and understand that, when important decisions are taken in relation to the humanitarian regime that is in place, they have before them the matters that the government had in mind when it took decisions. If those decisions are being taken, as I think they have been, for base political reasons, when one considers the timing it is important that people have an understanding that those factors were involved as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on this matter of humanitarian factors that are taken into account, I notice that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in another place has referred to me by name from time to time. I have found in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that he takes some of the support that I gave to the previous minister on aspects of the handling of refugee matters as a basis for extending that support in a way which is totally unreasonable&mdash;given my public utterances about the government's performance and about the total handling of those issues by the government. I notice that, on page 19 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of Senate Estimates Committee F which dealt with the estimates of the department of immigration, the minister said in relation to the boat people:</PARA>

<PARA>He then went on at the end of the page to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think it was accepted by Mr Ruddock and Senator Teague that, despite those hiccups in the processing that had been there, the delay in processing was not purely the province of the department. It related to other matters as well. Phillip Ruddock&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">accepted that the process that we put in place on detention was still appropriate in these circumstances.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make it very clear that, in relation to those matters, the minister was drawing a long bow. I thank the parliamentary secretary for her observations because, quite frankly, in relation to the humanitarian stream there is not an area in which I have been stronger in my condemnation of the government and its policies. Sure, I have accepted that it is appropriate under the circumstances in which people first came to Australia by boat that they enter into detention as part of a total framework of decision making in relation to people's entry into Australia. That in no way means that I condone the fact that people have been held in detention for four years because the government was incapable of administering a program or providing the resources to ensure that those matters were dealt with expeditiously and that people who had no claim were removed from Australia and that those people who had a claim were entitled to enter and remain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That condemnation is one of the shames that this government will bear because it provided resources that were inadequate to the task and it certainly was not in a position to administer a scheme fairly. I must say I do not think there has been a government that has been more roundly condemned than this one was in the judgment of Mr Justice Wilcox when he pointed out the double standards that this government had applied in relation to dealing with Chinese students and Khmer. Consider the fact that all those from one group were categorised as having a need for protection and all those from the other were categorised as having no need for protection. For the then Prime Minister of this country and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), who ought to have some experience in these matters, to have put at risk the decision making process&mdash;which they clearly did by their public statements&mdash;shows the ineptness of the people who are dealing with these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact. It cannot be denied. Mr Justice Wilcox is on the record. The decisions of the court are there for all to see. The public statements were known to us all. I have to say that, in relation to the handling of these matters, one of the aspects of it that I continue to regret is the extent to which we are moving in the special assistance category to a point where we now have criteria which are satisfied not by objective standards but by the country of origin of a person&mdash;not by an objective standard as to whether or not the individuals have been persecuted or subjected to conduct in a way related to individuals in particular but merely the fact that they come from a particular country. This is the basis upon which their claims will be considered more advantageously than the claims of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may come a time when we will very much regret that, in relation to these special categories, we have allowed those sorts of factors to intrude into the decision making process. I do not know the extent to which the bill we are dealing with will facilitate the government as it tries to weave a path in relation to these particular matters I have addressed. It may well be that we are facilitating the way in which it will have to respond to these changes that have occurred because of the political considerations. That may well be the case. If it is, so be it because I think it is appropriate that the government of the day have the power to be able to either raise or lower the number of people within each of the categories which are meant to be flexible. In other words, this legislation is merely giving effect to the scheme the FitzGerald report originally advanced. It is for that reason that it is being accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the trends that we are seeing now, which have given rise to my colleague in another place Senator Short saying that we need to more thoroughly investigate a lot of these matters, the fact that we have left open our comments in relation to the further steps that might be taken in terms of the humanitarian issues that are at present under scrutiny, should not be seen as a basis in this legislation for endorsement by us. In other words, our support for this legislation is related to the principle of the way decisions ought to be made. It is not an endorsement of the decisions the government is taking. That needs to be clearly understood. As time goes on and we see more clearly the consequences of these decisions&mdash;a situation which is quite fluid&mdash;we might well have a lot more to say about it. It is very important that it be understood that the minister and the government are on wood in relation to these questions. Nevertheless, this bill will not be opposed by the opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I view with surprise the fact that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), when he began the debate, started at great length to explain to us what the Migration Amendment ("Points" System) Bill was all about, as if we could not read it in the explanatory memorandum. I thought, `Fair enough, we will put it into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. We will not go into a second diatribe from him about how we should or should not change'. Then, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be well aware&mdash;you were listening as well as I&mdash;he came up with how it would be supported. But this was not good enough. We always have the idea somewhere along the line that there will be deceit and under the table things because the government is not really trying to simplify the act, according to him. But it is the intention of our Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) and this government to simplify the present points system, a points system that has had a number of anomalies since it came into existence in 1989&mdash;and which has always been there to be amended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go into the bill, which I support, I would like to correct some of the anomalies expressed by the honourable member for Berowra in his address on this bill. First we must have some honesty. There was a great diatribe about how all we did, as far as the timing of a decision on our Chinese students was concerned, was to get the election out of the way. How deceitful it is to say that. The commitment had always been given that those people would be given a temporary entry permit while consideration was given to the changing situations both in their country and here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time it was very clearly laid out that there would be a reinvestigation into what was happening. When people make a comparison, as the honourable member for Berowra does continually, between the Chinese students and the Cambodians, Laotians, boat people&mdash;or whatever we call those people who came here by boat&mdash;the fact is that one group came to this country legally and one landed on our shores illegally. There is a great difference in those two points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, no matter what steps we took, I would have liked to hear the honourable member for Berowra, as loudly as he has spoken in the House tonight, condemning all those lawyers and well-wishers who took on board the cases which they thought they would win very handsomely&mdash;but their representation and presentation proved very futile. At all times, the government went overboard in trying to be very fair in administering the law clearly and distinctly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of condemning the actions taken in a very difficult situation, credit at least should be given where it is due. I do not mind the opposition being negative. I am used to the honourable member for Berowra being negative on any action or step this government has taken in the past or is taking at present on immigration. But surely, somewhere along the line, we will finally hear from the honourable member a little appreciation of where we are going in amending the immigration legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point I would like to correct for the record is the `deceitful' way we seem to be bringing in conditions of entry for all these terrible people who happen to be here in this country&mdash;his words not mine. One thing he is right on is that there probably are in the vicinity of 16,000 or 17,000 students. Probably about 9,000 are already here under other conditions of entry as spouses or direct family members of those students. But we have to be honest and say that the conditions of entry which they must meet in their application certainly are very stringent. They include having to be under 45; being able to take other degrees that are acceptable in this country&mdash;or are in the process of studying for those degrees; having a business running and people employed other than their family; and having a knowledge of English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that should be acknowledged about those people since they have been here while all the questionable decisions have been taken&mdash;questionable in relation to what the honourable member was saying&mdash;is that at no time have surveys shown that those people have been a drain on the economy. If there have been one or two, that problem has been very minor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be very realistic. Whether mistakes were made in the past could be debated across the table in this parliament for a long time; but steps have been taken positively to amend that situation. At the same time, humanely, steps have been taken to say to those people who arrived in this country illegally, `You cannot come in under this process'. I know that when the people from Cambodia fled their country, the country was unsettled. Since then there has been a government election and our people have been over there helping to restore peace. The country is at least trying to adapt to a democratic system. We are saying to those people that they have a country to return to and we will assist them in that. If they wish to return in 12 months, and the people who wish to support them with all their good intentions can show that they wish to continue to do that in 12 months time, they can show a relationship to the country and can apply to come back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But those well-wishers and do-gooders will also have to provide some sort of financial assistance for those people's passage back to this country and assist them either with a job or other support when they arrive. The message has been spelt out clearly to people around the world that we are a humane country in our immigration process that has been put into place and amended over many years. But we are also saying that enough is enough. Even though we have wide shores we will not open them to everyone who chooses to build a boat or get on one. Those steps have to be taken and spelt out very succinctly and clearly. I hope that continues to be spelt out by our government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you gave me a long bow, as you did for the honourable member for Berowra, but I will now refer back to the bill before us. I repeat that the amendments seek to simplify the process of the points test used to assess our  migrant applications, as indicated under the independent concessional or extended family categories. It will now provide very clear and predictable rules but, most importantly, it will provide them with certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has relevance to all Australians, irrespective of their background. This bill recognises the need to make the elements in the process of migration which has been so vital throughout Australia's development that much simpler. My electorate of Prospect, as has been stated many times in this parliament, is the largest multicultural area in Australia. Our population consists of something like 105 nationalities. We have a diverse range of people. One thing I am very proud of is that in the last statistics it was shown that some 98 languages were spoken in the homes, other than English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also aware that there is a wide array of issues in the migration debate. Those complexities do abound and will continue to do so; but they are going to be solved only with practical application and reassessment of the rules and laws we have in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra mentioned refugees and what we might do for them in a humanitarian way. I would also like to state that I am a little concerned about some of the objections expressed by our adult migrant education teachers who feel that 510 hours with our newly arrived migrants is not enough for them to learn English. The continual barrage we seem to be getting in our electorate offices is rather disturbing because we certainly welcome these people. We provide facilities for them to come to this country and for them to learn English. We understand that without a knowledge of English they will make very little contribution to the country&mdash;nor will they find jobs readily. </PARA>

It is equivalent to five months of schooling for our kids who go to school, if we were to take the example of a Monday to Friday school week. I believe that with solid application that is certainly giving those people a large incentive to learn the language. I will not refer to the days of the 1920s and 1930s&mdash;perhaps even when my father-in-law came out here and had to pick up a comic book to teach himself English. That assistance was not available in the 1920s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say, thank God that has now changed. But let us not then try to say, `Well, we have some people who need more, some people who need less;  510 hours is not enough, we want 900 hours'. I continue to refute that. I believe the facilities must be provided for the teaching of English. The  facilities that are provided must be adequate and they certainly must be provided for our new arrivals. For those who need assistance and help to settle in, we must have a time factor so that they can come back. Some mothers have indicated that they need to establish their families first and then have the opportunity of learning English. I believe that is all in place and it will continue to be in place. Personally, I think that 510 hours is more than enough. When we are creating easier paths to enable people from overseas to settle here, we should create easier paths that are logical and simpler. That is why we have the amendments in this bill that is before the parliament tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see that the benefits flowing from our migrants to this country are very much a two-way affair. Historically, Australia's migration policies have focused on two major aspects. One has encompassed the need for people, economic development and security, while humanitarian factors represent another.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The points system for independent and concessional family migration has operated well since 1989, but it needs to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be understood that points are now to be given for different categories and those points are to be allowed to be assessed in a pool area. With regard to the adjustments, some people have complained that they could not understand what happened to their application when they did not quite make the mark. That is now going to be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very clearly, what is going to happen with the pool system is that the number of applicants in the pool will be able to be increased by the lowering of the pool entrance mark. I think the existence of what is presently in place&mdash;those three different mark systems&mdash;has certainly only operated to confuse all of our applicants overseas. I have had it continually expressed to me in my electorate office by people who have asked, `What has happened? Why aren't we being accepted?'. It has had to be explained to them, `You have a right to have your assessments reassessed but it requires gazettal and it requires time'. In some cases it has gone on for well in excess of 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has not allowed people, who have made applications, to plan their lives. It will now be very clearly defined. If people do not reach the pool mark, their application will be refused. If they reach the pool mark, they are then pooled and they know a decision must be made within 12 months. People who have got the pass mark will go immediately on to the further checks that are required with regard to health, security or whatever. It is now a very clear distinction rather than being left in never-never land, hoping somewhere along the line those people may get it or may not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have to be very honest with our applicants. Certainly, we have to be honest with regard to this amendment. I believe that is why it is before the parliament tonight. It will replace that three mark system with a very simplified two mark approach which enables, as has been stated, the adjustment of the pool and the pass marks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current requirement of three gazettals, I believe, has been too extreme. Under the present system those three gazettals of changed pass marks could occur over a period well in excess of those 12 months that I have indicated. That is why I am pleased that the conditions that are contained within these amendments will eliminate that uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does not change the essence of the operation of the points and pooling system;  rather, it refines the administration. That is what I thought the honourable member for Berowra might have touched on at least once during the 30 minutes in which he was on his feet. Our government will certainly have greater control over the numbers in the pool at any one time. It will certainly be able to target the migration planning levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the benefits are very obvious. I would like to refer to some that I see that this amendment bill will bring to this country. The people who are waiting in the pool will know that the maximum period of time before they meet or fail to meet the pass mark is 12 months. They can therefore plan their futures with certainty. It will be easier for people from non-English speaking backgrounds whose knowledge of English may be limited to understand the mechanisms of the Migration Act and regulations. The amendments will make the legislation less legalistic and certainly less complex than has been the case until now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the bill for various reasons, including that it allows the migration process to work more efficiently. Surely, we in government should be about having efficient legislation. Australia's migrant population has contributed significantly in many ways to Australia through sheer hard work and through the diversity of cultures that those many migrants have brought to our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Migrants have positive records in many arenas, such as in our sporting fields, in research and academic fields. They are well represented in all tiers of government and industry. To list the achievements of Australia's migrant population would be stating the obvious. Australia has reaped many benefits from its overseas born citizens. With the assistance of migrants we have created a modern, tolerant, prosperous and democratic society. Changes like the ones proposed in this Migration Amendment ("Points" System) Bill are critical elements of the federal government's reform process of enhancing and continuing worthwhile migrant programs. </PARA>

My colleague the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) made a number of very important points about this Migration Amendment ("Points" System) Bill. One of the things she mentioned was the constant harping by the honourable member for Berowra when he was the shadow minister. Now that he is representing the shadow minister in this chamber, he comes into the House and says, `We don't disagree with this bill. We agree with the general policy of this bill'. He then starts to get into the government on the administration of immigration or on some other matter in relation to immigration that is unrelated to the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very interesting phrase because I attended the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council of Australia conference last weekend. One thing that was remarked upon was that the shadow minister, Senator Short, for the first time by anyone from the conservative side in a major speech admitted that the opposition in the last few elections, and in particular in the 1993 election, had comprehensively lost the ethnic vote. The honourable member for Berowra thinks this is amusing, but it is not amusing because he used to be the shadow minister. During the time that he was the shadow minister we raised on a number of occasions the fact that he represented a number of important issues in such a way that ethnic communities perceived the Liberal Party as being against their interests. That was the perception that they were given.</PARA></TALK.START>

Instead, very tough positions were adopted by the opposition on a range of immigration and ethnic issues. As a consequence, the final humiliation for the opposition was in July 1992 when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) attacked multiculturalism in a very big way.

He spent the next six months trying to get out of it because the response from ethnic communities was furious.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the honourable member was speaking and getting into the government, we said nothing. Now he is trying to interrupt every half a minute. The fact is that the honourable member does not like what we are saying. As I said, following the report we changed the rules so that we had a much cleaner and better regime on the marriage issue. There was a change of status on the basis of marriage so that people now have to wait for two years. Some people are not aware of this and try to get around the system. They are suddenly stunned to find that there is a two-year period. We have to make it perfectly clear that it will not be tolerated if people think they can get around the immigration system through false or non-genuine marriages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra asked about overseas applicants. Our embassies are there to test overseas applicants who apply on the basis of marriage.

That is the job of the embassy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra talks about imposing a two-year rule for overseas applicants.

That is the issue that has been raised. That is not changing at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government has been very sensitive to input on this matter, especially the current Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus). He is a very sensitive man on all these issues, and he has been very sensitive to the way in which this points system will operate in the future. If the honourable member for Berowra has any complaints about this he should forward them, along with concrete suggestions, to the minister. There have been two stages in the modern points system. It was introduced in 1979 by Minister Macphee&mdash;I am not entirely sure, but it was one of the conservative ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was Minister Macphee, who was one of the great ministers for immigration. The principle, together with the floating mark, was adopted in 1989 in order to deal with the control that was required in each of the two categories. One of the important things introduced in our response to the FitzGerald report referred to precisely what people were given points for in the two categories. While there are some similarities there are also significant differences because of the sponsorship involved in the family reunion category. What have we had from the opposition about the family reunion category? There has never been a time that I can remember when the opposition has not attacked it, when it has not wanted to get rid of it.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is so. When we first introduced the two categories the opposition objected because FitzGerald had recommended one category. The honourable member has forgotten that. The fact of the matter is that we rejected the FitzGerald recommendation and went for the two categories precisely because we wanted to have a distinct family reunion category.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has been making attacks on the family reunion category, but without it the humanitarian edge of our immigration program would disappear. For that reason I believe that we should sustain the points system&mdash;the two separate points systems for the two categories&mdash;and welcome the changes that will simplify and improve the system. I look forward to a situation where the government is responding in a sensitive way to the concerns expressed by people applying for migration, while at the same time ensuring that shonky applications, or people who try to get around the system, are dealt with severely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to one other matter that was raised by both the honourable member for Berowra and Senator Short at the FECCA conference, and that is the very important matter of the special assistance category. The opposition has raised concerns about the application of the special assistance category, and I understand that it will be looking at the implementation of that category. I urge the honourable member for Berowra and Senator Short to maintain bipartisan support for the special assistance category. Some people claim that the special assistance category has the appearance of being discriminatory because it applies to certain groups of people who are severely disadvantaged or who come from regions that are severely disadvantaged at a particular time. The fact is that the special assistance category has a very important humanitarian function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the government is happy to hear from the opposition its recommendations for additions and amendments, but I hope that it does not throw out the baby with the bath water in trying to get rid of this special assistance category. We need support for the special assistance category because of what it is able to do in drastic situations&mdash;in Cambodia, in the former Yugoslavia and in a number of other places. It has served a very important humanitarian function for those people who cannot technically meet the definition of `refugee' under the criteria of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees but who nevertheless have a very important humanitarian claim and who can demonstrate family or other links with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister should be commended for the way in which he has expanded the special assistance category to help the many people who have found themselves caught between the cracks, so to speak, in making applications as refugees, as well as helping many people already here in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill 1993 deals with an area of considerable interest to a number of members of this House&mdash;an area that has raised some very interesting concerns over the last couple of years. I am pleased to say that people are now paying a great deal more attention to matters relating to the potential pollution of the sea, particularly in areas of economic importance, such as our fishing and tourism industries, which in particular parts of Australia depends on the maintenance of a sound and safe maritime environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By embracing other protocols, the bill ensures that Australia extends its area of interest in the maritime environment so that we have greater control over the types of goods and products that can be disposed of in the sea.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, a certain organophosphate&mdash;I cannot recall its exact name&mdash;has been specifically included amongst the items banned from being dumped in our maritime environment, which extends to areas of the Southern and Indian oceans. This is an issue of great importance because we are looking for ways of ensuring that the maritime environment is not polluted by commercial shipping or any other form of activity that goes on at sea. Commercial shipping is not the only cause of pollution. Pollution can be caused by things such as oil wells and drilling rigs that operate at sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As these matters have arisen over the last few years&mdash;certainly since I have been representing the opposition on maritime matters&mdash;the opposition has been prepared to strongly support all reasonable measures to protect Australia's interests in the maritime area, particularly as they relate to our environment. This bill goes in that direction. It is for that reason that I am pleased to be able to say that the opposition will be supporting the legislation. I simply note at this point that the shadow minister for the environment, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), will be speaking on this matter a little later, if time permits, so we will hear from her some of the views that she has about this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past few years, there has been growing evidence of pollution in our maritime environment. I was in Tasmania only a few days ago and was speaking to people on this subject. If my memory serves me correctly, Tasmania is the only state in Australia that has specific legislation in this area to deal with what is happening in their own waters. The Tasmanian government has also agreed to introduce complementary legislation into its parliament to ensure that it is in line with the legislation that this House is debating tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must ensure that Australia does not allow our maritime environment to be polluted by ballast water being disposed of within our close maritime environment. In Tasmania, I spoke to someone with a particular interest in the dumping of ballast water, and that person drew to my attention how potentially dangerous and how potentially damaging the disposal of ballast water by foreign ships can be. This person went into some detail to explain the sort of damage that has already occurred in Tasmanian waters as a result of the disposal of ballast water by foreign ships in close proximity to the coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The damage done by ballast waters to oceans can be quite extraordinary. We are not talking about a little murky water being pumped out into the ocean; we are talking about all types of marine life that can be brought from one part of the world to Australia that can do immense harm to our maritime environment, to our commercial fishing industries and to other aspects of commercial life in Australia. These can run into hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, worth of damage if we are not careful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The example that was given to me was, I think, in Canada in the Great Lakes. A particular organism was transported to the Great Lakes in ballast waters of ships from some part of the world. As a result of that, some type of growth is now entering into, I think, the dams and pipelines of the hydro-electric schemes in and around that part of world, and it is costing hundreds of millions of dollars to try to stop these organisms from growing and affecting the operations of those schemes. That is just one example of the problems that a particular country is facing as a result of the disposal of ballast waters, bringing foreign organisms into our own environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here in Australia we have examples of that sort of situation occurring, doing damage to our maritime environment. Indeed, the stories that this gentleman was telling me are really quite alarming. What I would hope we could do over the next year or two, and I am sure that honourable members would agree with me, is to draw to the public's attention the tremendous damage that can be done by inappropriate ballast water disposal&mdash;in the same way as over the last couple of years, by efforts from members on both sides of this House, we have been able to draw to the attention of the Australian public the potential damage that can occur to the Great Barrier Reef as a result of pollution from shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have seen over the years a number of changes occur through legislation passed in this parliament, or through complementary legislation passed in other state parliaments, to ensure that our Great Barrier Reef&mdash;one of the great treasures of Australia's tourism industry; one of the great wonders of the world&mdash;is further protected from possible damage to its environment by a ship sinking, running onto the reef, turning over or doing something that would cause pollution to emanate from it when in trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have gone to compulsory pilotage through the reef. We have just seen&mdash;I hope I am getting the company right&mdash;Caltex provide $80,000 worth of sponsorship to look at alternative routes outside the Great Barrier Reef for commercial shipping to use as, of course, has been the history of commercial shipping along the east coast of Australia. Commercial shipping has preferred, in the main, to travel within the area of the Great Barrier Reef rather than to go outside it. There are many good reasons for doing that. The sponsorship from Caltex has enabled some research to be undertaken to see whether there are better routes outside the Great Barrier Reef that would minimise any potential damage to it by a ship sinking or getting into some sort of difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think over the last few years we have been successful in highlighting potential damage from pollution at sea in the Great Barrier Reef region. As a result, I think some very sensible actions have been taken by government to try to do the very best to minimise that potential damage. In the same way, it is my hope that we could draw to the attention of the Australian parliament and to the people of this country the very real need to do everything that we can to try to minimise the potential damage from the disposal of ballast water in our own Australian waters. I am convinced, after speaking to a number of people, that the commercial and environmental damage that can be done by releasing ballast water into our waters in the future could be quite catastrophic for this country. So I take the opportunity that this debate affords us to make that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, I am very pleased to say, is widely supported by the Australian shipping industry. The Australian shipping industry has been very cooperative and, indeed, I think it has been very forward thinking in the way in which it has cooperated with government to do the best that it can to be a good corporate citizen in Australia. We have seen some tremendous advances made over the last couple of years; indeed, dating back over many years, starting with Ralph Hunt's tenure as the minister for transport in the  Fraser-Anthony government in shipping reform. Much of that shipping reform has, of course, been driven by the industry itself and, to be fair, by the Seamen's Union, which I am pleased&mdash;and some would say surprised&mdash;has taken the issue of reform within its own industry, grasped it by the nettle and decided to drive it rather than being pushed into reform.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have seen, as is evidenced again by the bill that we are debating in the House tonight, that shipowners in the Australian shipping industry have been very good corporate citizens. They have supported the sort of legislation that we are debating tonight; as, indeed, they have the health and safety legislation for the maritime industry which would have been debated earlier this evening had not the House been full of a lot of windbags and not under the auspices of a guillotine so that we were not able to debate it. But, like that legislation, the industry has taken a responsible stand and highlighted some deficiencies in the legislation, which I was pleased to see were corrected&mdash;things such as masters not having full authority over their vessels in certain circumstances. The government amended the legislation to ensure that that was the case. I guess a valid point that the industry makes, which I would have commented on had we been given the opportunity to debate the legislation earlier today, is that the occupational health and safety legislation should have also come in a package with the compensation legislation that we debated, if my memory serves me rightly, in about June last year. Those bills should have come together rather than coming more than 12 months apart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) said that we could not possibly have had the two bills come together as a package because the election split them up. That is the reason for the gap between the compensation and rehabilitation legislation that we debated last year, and the health and safety legislation that we should have debated earlier this evening. Those points are worth making. I am sure that honourable members on both sides of the House would recognise that it is worth making the point that the issue of pollution at sea has, over the last few years, been a bipartisan issue&mdash;one supported by both sides of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must admit though that there are some issues in the maritime area which are not bipartisan. One of the things that this side of the House violently opposed, and will continue to oppose, was the extraordinary increase in the excise on fuel, which was brought down in the budget in August of this year. It was a more savage blow for the shipping industry than for any other industry in Australia because shipping uses bunker oil, which had, prior to the budget, an excise of 5.5c a litre. The government's decision to increase that excise by 5c a litre meant that a 92 per cent increase would result in the excise from the budget decision. That boiled down to something in the order of&mdash;again, if memory serves me rightly&mdash;$22 million worth of excise being paid by the Australian shipping industry; an average cost of around $360,000 for each Australian vessel, when the Australian shipping industry had been undertaking reform. The latest round in that reform had delivered savings in the order of $270,000 for each Australian flag vessel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet having just achieved that reform and that sort of saving, the government, in the same week, was going to load an extra $360,000 in costs onto the average Australian ship through increased oil fuel excise. At the end of the day, after a lot of toing-and-froing and a backdown by Senator Harradine, rather than being knocked off in the Senate, the excise was reduced to 3c a litre from 5c. That still adds $217,000 to the operating costs of the average Australian flagged vessel. That does away with a lot of the advantage that Australian ships and the shipping industry have received as a result of shipping reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder how happy Seamen's Union representatives would be. Seamen have seen a great deal of reform&mdash;many making sacrifices in the process of that reform&mdash;in order to sustain the viability of the Australian shipping industry and to ensure that their colleagues will be able to obtain useful employment in that industry in the future, only to see that sacrifice thrown out the window by the government's decision to jack up the fuel excise, taking away most of the benefit that has been achieved from shipping reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is that type of hypocrisy and lunacy that we on this side of the House have the legitimate right to oppose. But we will continue to make those sorts of comments and take up that form of opposition whenever we see the government doing things to harm the Australian shipping industry. We think viability is crucial to the Australian shipping industry&mdash;and any Australian government interested in a good future for that shipping industry will take note of that. We cannot have proper pollution at sea measures put in place and proper safety measures undertaken on board vessels if the owners of those vessels are not operating profitably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst many people on the other side of the House have a philosophical objection to people making a profit in business, one of the critical things I have learnt&mdash;and I am sure that even the honourable member for Throsby would agree with me&mdash;is that whenever the world's shipping industry is operating at a loss, safety levels are decreased. Maintenance is not kept up and lifeboats are not properly maintained. We then get some ludicrous situations. We saw such a situation in Gladstone only this week when a vessel, which was caught out only six or eight months ago by AMSA, was pulled up because the propeller on the lifeboat would not turn around. That sort of poor safety and poor maintenance occurs because the people who own those ships are not making enough money to afford to keep their ships in proper order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are other extenuating circumstances. The best we could say about some of the registration societies is that they are crooked, and the worst we could say is that they ought to be chased off the face of the earth. But I think there is a direct link between viability and safety. If a company that owns a ship is operating profitably, it enhances its ability to keep up proper maintenance on the ship and, therefore, proper safety procedures. So there is a link between industry viability and safety measures on board vessels, and indeed our ability to ensure that the Australian shipping industry complies to the sorts of pollution at sea requirements that this government&mdash;and indeed the Australian society&mdash;would expect of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is once again an occasion for the opposition to support a bill of this nature because we do recognise the importance of protecting our environment. I know that my colleague the shadow minister for the environment, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), agrees with me wholeheartedly. We will continue to do so whenever such bills are of a reasonable nature. At the same time, whilst taking a bipartisan position, we will do our very best to highlight the cargo cult mentality of this government in relation to transport&mdash;whether it is shipping, rail, road or anything else related to transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few years, this government has done nothing but tax our Australian transport industry. It is at the point now where I am convinced that the only way we can do anything to help the Australian transport industries is to do away with some of those taxes, as the opposition intended to do in its Fightback package. Had the Fightback package been implemented, there would have been around an $800,000 difference in operating costs per ship, per annum compared to what the Australian shipping industry has ended up with under the Labor government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that example alone proves the point that if this government wants to do something for shipping and transport the one thing it can stop doing is taxing those industries to death. The opposition will support this legislation, as we will on future occasions in relation to reasonable legislation which goes to protecting the maritime environment from pollution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would not be a shipping debate if I did not follow the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) in speaking in this chamber. At the outset, I will make a couple of points about his speech. As usual, he was gracious in his comments about the Seamen's Union and niggardly in his comments about the Waterside Workers Federation. He knows, as I do, that the two are now amalgamated into the Maritime Union of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I suggest that before the honourable member gives a serve to the waterside workers he should have a look at their history of reform. As I have said many times before in this chamber, a whole range of issues were involved on the waterfront. It is not good enough to hint that if we had got rid of what was the Waterside Workers Federation all would have been sweetness and light. That is not true. The Waterside Workers Federation reform package and the reforms that it carried out were as great, or almost as great, as the exercise in reform by the Seamen's Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with what the honourable member said about ballast water. Some of the water that has been released in Twofold Bay&mdash;an area that he is familiar with&mdash;from ships coming in has been a worry. There is also a debate going on as to whether ships should go inside or outside the Great Barrier Reef. I welcome the investigation being conducted in that regard. My information is that it is actually safer to go inside the reef because there are definite channels. Ships are protected from the elements and it is also quicker&mdash;so, in the old capitalist phrase, `it saves money'. Nevertheless, if Caltex is generous enough to put up $80,000 for that study, we would all welcome it. Maybe some of the questions raised in debate in this chamber and elsewhere about whether ships should travel inside or outside the reef will be answered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill is to amend the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Act 1981 to raise the maximum rate of oil pollution levy which can be applied to commercial shipping using Australian ports. The bill is fairly narrow in its terms. I suspect that the honourable member for Hume may well have been discussing legislation that is scheduled for debate in this chamber tomorrow. Having said that, he has nevertheless exercised his right to engage in wide ranging debate on this bill. I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you will extend to me the same generosity for a wide ranging debate as you extended to the honourable member for Hume. There will then be no bitterness about the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy that was introduced in 1973 provides funds towards the costs associated with the operation of Australia's national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil. The national plan brings together Commonwealth, state, territory and industry expertise and combat capacity under one national contingency plan. Since 1 January 1991, it has been administered by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority&mdash;AMSA. The levy funds the administration of the national plan, including equipment acquisition, maintenance and training. It also provides a contingency fund to cover costs incurred in responding to marine pollution incidents. The act currently provides that the rate of levy per quarter is such rate not exceeding 4c per tonne of the tonnage of the ship, as is prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rate of levy was previously prescribed by regulation at 2.2c per tonne. However, this rate was raised to 4c per tonne from 1 October 1993. This increase enabled AMSA to implement the recent decisions of Commonwealth and state transport ministers aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the plan. These decisions flowed from consideration of a high level review of the national plan by a Commonwealth-state industry working party. Additional funds are required to purchase additional response equipment to enhance response capability in the event of major spills and put in place contractual arrangements to enhance fixed wing dispersant delivery capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the prescribed rate of levy to meet these additional funding demands will, however, remove the leeway that has previously existed between the rate of levy prescribed by regulation and the limit on the levy set by the act. This leeway is essential to allow AMSA to react speedily to a large funding requirement that might arise in the case of a major incident. While in almost all cases costs of responding to oil pollution incidents are recovered from the polluter, there is an immediate call on funds, and it may be some time before these can be restored. In such cases, the ability to increase the levy by regulation will allow AMSA to borrow funds at short notice by giving it the financial capacity to service and repay such a loan from the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase to 6c per tonne in the maximum rate of levy that can be prescribed, as proposed in this legislation, maintains the current relationship between the rate of levy prescribed by regulation and the maximum rate capable of being prescribed. Naturally, everyone hopes that there will never be a need to raise the rate of levy to pay for a clean up of a major oil spill. Yet, increasingly, we are being faced with the possibility of a major environmental catastrophe along the Australian coastline as ships, best described as `rust buckets' ply to and from Australia and along the Australian coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not necessarily oil tankers that are presenting major threats because, with the notable exception of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>, most oil companies are strict in their inspections and requirements for tankers. In my view, the biggest environmental threat is from bilge oil from coal carrying ships sailing up and down the Australian coast inside the Great Barrier Reef. It has always seemed to me to be a case of not if, but when, we will be faced with an environmental disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, released at this time last year, highlighted the conditions of many of these ships. AMSA has stepped up inspections of ships and, indeed, a month ago there were six foreign ships being detained in Australian ports. Contrary to some media reports that claimed that this was an indication that the recommendations contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report were not being implemented, it illustrates that the inspection services have been considerably tightened up. Indeed, there are currently several ships being detained in Australian ports&mdash;one in Brisbane and one in Port Hedland&mdash;which is further proof that the inspection services have been improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) has given the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure a further reference to continue this work because there are still too many incidents of unsafe shipping off the Australian coastline which pose a threat to the marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area requiring considerable tightening up is the issue of single voyage permits. Single voyage permits are issued by the Department of Transport and Communications when there is not an Australian ship available for the cargo. I believe that before such permits are issued the ship should be inspected to ensure that it complies with all Australian health and safety requirements. Such, currently, is not the practice and it is far too easy for single voyage permits to be issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some unknown bureaucrat in the transport department, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS> of 3 December, referred to my remarks regarding single voyage permits as `bull' with a few exclamation marks after it; I do not know what that bureaucrat means. I challenge this gutless wonder to put his or her name to the comments made. I do not mind being challenged on what I say, but I do object when bureaucrats use a departmental source to launch an unfounded attack on me because of comments that I make. These people say that they follow the system and that it is a difficult system to administer. The point is made here that people in the department are constantly talking to the industry and the unions about the issue of special voyage permits. That is simply not true. The unions often get 20 or 24 hours notice, but they are not constantly talking to them about it. If the department's record is so good, why are so many ships with single voyage permits being detained&mdash;such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anand</EMPHASIS> in Gladstone recently. That ship was issued with a single voyage permit from Albany, and in Gladstone it was found to have 140 defects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in the Department of Transport and Communications say that I should talk to them. I do not mind if they want to talk to me before they go criticising me in documents. I will be replying to this with great vigour. Before people start criticising me and my comments on single voyage permits, they should have the guts to put their names to what they say. Members of parliament cannot get away with that sort of disguise when we make statements either inside this chamber or outside. We are always identified, and I have no difficulty with that. I do not think I have ever given anonymous stories to anyone. It is rankling when people want to beat up some story about me and what I said about single voyage permits. The interesting thing is that the bureaucrat was totally wrong in the article. The writer justified everything that I had said, and that was admitted in the article. Nevertheless, I think people should put their names to articles of this type. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When our premier tourist resort, the Great Barrier Reef, is awash with oil, it will be too late to call for a tightening up of regulations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about shipping in this debate. There was another bill passed in this House earlier today that is related to this legislation, but because of time constraints I did not have an opportunity to comment. I refer to the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Bill. This bill will make the maritime industry a healthier and safer industry to work in. In the Australian shipping industry alone, over the past five years there has been an average of 1,000 injuries a year reported to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. I suggest that many of these injuries could have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main point that I should like to make about the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Bill is that it completes a comprehensive safety net for Australian seafarers&mdash;all achieved in the last few years via union, industry and government consultation and cooperation. Seafaring is a dangerous occupation and injury rates have been unacceptably high. With the passage of this legislation there will now be a system to minimise injuries and maximise rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many vessels in the seagoing sector already have on board health and safety experts, and the act will simply clarify the role and function of these people. Ships without occupational health and safety committees will need to establish them. All vessels covered by the Commonwealth Navigation Act will now need to comply with the new Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act. Health and safety representatives will have their rights and responsibilities outlined in the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ALMA surveyors will become occupational health and safety inspectors for the industry. The Seacare authority will oversee the administration of the act, together with the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. Most importantly, health and safety representatives, inspectors and, indeed, all seafarers will receive training about the new occupational health and safety act and all that it entails. I welcome the legislation that has been put to this House which concerns wide maritime issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put the mind of the honourable member for Hume at rest, let me assure him that I share many of the concerns that he has outlined tonight about the increase in the excise on fuel. I must say, in all honesty, that I felt it was a very regrettable decision, for many of the reasons that he has outlined. The shipping industry, through management, unions and others, has made tremendous strides in the last few years to make the industry profitable. I hope that even at this late stage the government might have another look at that. The simple act of increasing the fuel excise has wiped out many of the gains that had been achieved. It was a most regrettable step. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the night is getting late, and with the vision of us all sitting here until Saturday, I shall try to make my remarks brief. I want to approach this, as the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) foreshadowed earlier, to make one or two environmental comments about the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill which, as other members have said, is a way of increasing the levy in case there is a chance of an oil spill. The present levy is 4c and the bill allows that to be increased by an extra 2c to take care of any spill. The levy funds the national plan to combat the pollution of the sea by oil, including more equipment to deal with any spill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having mentioned that, there are some concerns that I would like to raise. Oil spills are one of the biggest threats that we have to our coastline. That fact has been confirmed in the recently published RAC report. I suspect that the threat that we have from ballast water, which the honourable member for Hume also mentioned, is one of those threats that we have to now consider, considering what has come from Tasmania. Undoubtedly, the threat of another <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS>, or another <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> of a large size, is something that worries all Australians. This government has to look more seriously at what can happen in cases of oil spills and what must be done to prevent them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we can ever reach a point where we can have 100 per cent prevention and say that we will not have oil spills. But, as part of our coastal policy, we should have more action to prevent them from happening. This bill starts to look at what happens after we have had the spill, but that is not good enough. I ask the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to bring down her coastal policy a little quicker than she has. We have only a draft coastal policy now, but perhaps we could speed that up and look towards getting a full coastal policy with more action in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, there were 175 marine oil spills around the coast of Australia. Of those, 33 per cent were within ports and 17 of those had to be dealt with by AMSA and the national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil, which this bill refers to. </PARA>
<PARA>The RAC report also comments that this plan, as good as it may seem on the surface, has its problems. Indeed, it has $13 million worth of specialised equipment, which seems a positive thing to have until we look at the Commonwealth Auditor-General's report of 1993. It found that some of this plant was inoperable and that other parts of the plant simply could not be located, certainly not in a hurry, which does not give us much confidence in what is going to happen if there is an oil spill and we need to get that equipment out there to deal with the oil spill. </PARA>

We need to look at how that equipment is stored and how available it is. It is not good enough to say we have $13 million worth of equipment in case we have a spill. For one thing, I do not think it is enough; but, for another, if a lot of that equipment were inoperable and could not be readily located, what would the consequences be if there were an oil spill? Would we have people on the phone saying, `Where do we find it? Where was it last seen? Who had it last? Does it work? Did somebody remember to oil it?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote from an article by Mr John Enders, of the Associated Press. He filed this in San Francisco under the heading `Much of the world's oil moved by obsolete ships: US tanks and safety'. The article is dated 27 March 1993 and reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Four years after the Exxon Valdez dramatised the gooey horrors of an oil spill, the world still relies on hundreds of rusting, ageing, unregulated tankers with ill-trained crews to transport its most critical fuel. Although US safety has improved, vast stretches of sea and coast elsewhere remain vulnerable to what tanker safety critics call a fleet of floating catastrophes waiting to happen. In the past six months alone four big tanker spills have fouled the waters of the South Pacific to the North Atlantic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the biggest tanker safety critics are the big oil companies themselves which are confronting enormous liability costs and tougher regulations in the United States, the single biggest market for imported oil. Their primary targets are the smaller independent charter shippers who historically have been able to ferry enormous cargoes at far cheaper rates because they take big risks, ranging from shoddy maintenance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as mentioned by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to sailing in dangerous waters to save money&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as mentioned by the honourable member for Throsby&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`It is an industry that if you don't have a high dedication to quality, some day you are going to pay the price', said David Powell, fleet manager of Chevron Shipping Company, a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation and a vocal critic of the smaller rogue shippers. Some big oil companies are relying increasingly on their own ships instead of chartering them. Some are building their own new double-hull tankers which, theoretically, are safer. Some, such as the San Francisco based Chevron, have created their own tanker tracking systems to know which independent shippers have the most hazardous histories. Chevron Shipping constantly updates a database showing locations, owners and operators of 10,000 tankers worldwide, including 3,250 ocean going vessels. P.R. Grant, Chevron Shipping head tanker tracker, says many should be scrapped. Grant and other industry officials decline to discuss specific ships. `But up to 20 per cent of the world's tankers are potentially disastrous', said Grant's boss, Doug Wilcott, Chevron Shipping president. Shell International Petroleum Company Pty Ltd, another big oil shipper, issued a similar estimate in February. Much of the oil industry's sensitivity to safety stems from the March 24 1989 disaster at Alaska's Prince William Sound, which changed the way people viewed environmental damage. The grounded <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> spilled about 11 million gallons, or 41.6 million litres, of crude oil and devastated large sections of pristine coastline. Exxon Corporation has spent $US5 billion and $A7.11 billion to clean up the mess.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1990, Congress passed a law raising liability limits and requiring double-hulled tankers in US waters by 2015. Europe is moving in the same direction. The US changes apparently are working domestically where only a few minor spills have happened since the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> calamity. But industry and environmental groups say that not nearly enough has been done elsewhere. Shipping insurance statistics show that 65 per cent of the world tanker tonnage is at least 15 years old, considering a complete lifespan for big tankers. Roger Cone, a spokesman for the International Maritime Organisation, a London based agency that monitors world shipping, has said that that is about the time when people are beginning to scrap their ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Experts say that the key problem is obsolete tankers plying trade routes worldwide. No agency has authority to order them out of service. Regulations governing tanker operation, maintenance and crew hiring vary widely. IMO standards depend on voluntary enforcement. Only 20 per cent of signatories even report violations. Periodic tanker inspections by major oil companies are common, but smaller owners and independent operators frequently rely on self-policing that often overlooks serious maintenance shortcomings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tanker charter rates are so low that few companies have incentives to build more expensive ships which encourage operators of shoddy, older tankers to keep them afloat. Crew members sometimes are little more than common labourers hired at dockside. They do not necessarily speak the same language as the officers. The larger supertankers weigh 400,000 tonnes, are four football fields long and carry nearly 120 million gallons or 454 million litres of crude. </PARA>

That is more than double the load dumped by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS>. The crew included a Greek captain, a Filipino and Polish sailors. The company said that language was not a problem and blamed the weather. Also in January, the Danish ship <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Maersk Navigator</EMPHASIS>, with nearly 78 million gallons or 295 million litres of crude, collided with an empty tanker, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sanko Honour</EMPHASIS>, in the crowded shipping lanes off north Indonesia.

Its captain had attempted to bring the ship into port without a pilot. Some shipping experts say that the biggest reason for accidents is not the ships but the operators. Richard Gulob, the publisher of Gulob's Oil Pollution Bulletin&mdash;a journal in Cambridge, Massachusetts&mdash;has said that the vast majority of tanker accidents are caused by human error. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While American owned ships must adhere to new standards under the Oil Pollution Act 1990, owners and operators of foreign flag tankers do not. Many tankers fly so-called flags of convenience from Panama, Libya, Greece, South Korea, St Vincent and the Grenadines to avoid such requirements. Environmental critics say that independent tanker owners have historically operated with impunity. Behr Henneman, a spokesman for the Centre for Marine Conservation in San Francisco, has said that it has been very much a laissez faire industry policed operation for a long time. He also said that, if we were as upset about tanker accidents as we are about airline accidents, tanker accidents would be few and far between.

There will be two main elements in its functions ensuring that industry parties are complying with the legislation requirements to establish appropriate arrangements to protect the health and safety of employees at work, conducting spot checks, responding to requests for investigations, conducting investigations into significant accidents and dangerous situations and taking such action as required to ensure deficiencies are rectified. </PARA>

Currently, the Australian shipping industry contributes only four per cent to international cargoes entering and leaving Australian ports. Further, the cabotage provisions&mdash;the carriage of domestic cargoes by domestic shipping&mdash;is being eroded by the outrageous levels of special voyage permits currently being granted, as mentioned by the honourable member for Throsby. </PARA>

With few exceptions, nations ensure their domestic economic security by cabotage. Those on the other side would leave Australia at the mercy of international shipping companies and thus put in jeopardy Australia's ability to ensure economic integrity if they attacked the cabotage. The willy-nilly granting of special voyage permits allows foreign vessels to carry cargo at rates which are non-competitive in that they just need to cover fuel costs to ensure higher profits on what would otherwise be dead legs in full voyage patterns. </PARA>

The average age of international ships is 18 years. The flag of convenience ships have safety standards based on very dodgy surveys, as pointed out by the honourable member for Hume. The insurance underwriters are increasingly faced with risks that will inevitably drive up premiums to a point where shipping costs will dramatically increase. </PARA>

The unfortunate scenario is, however, that the world shipping industry would need an injection of $400 billion in capital investment to improve the world fleet&mdash;to eradicate the ships of shame depicted in the inquiry into ship safety by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, chaired by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris).

ANL continues to be a major participant in the SIRA process, which effectively began in 1988. The prospect for success was significantly enhanced with the line's participation.

I was not quite certain, after hearing the speech of the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), whether this was the correct bill. I hope to speak on the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill tomorrow. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe) said in the second reading speech:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in the maximum rate of levy that can be prescribed to 6c per tonne as proposed in this legislation maintains the current relationship between the rate of levy prescribed by regulation and the maximum rate capable of being prescribed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government hopes of course that we will never need to raise the rate of levy to pay for the clean-up of a major spill.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to say that the 6c levy is not enough; it should be more. My liking for oil companies is well known. When I was first elected in 1983, I think one of the first speeches I made was against certain oil companies in Westernport Bay&mdash;one company was BP. I will come back to that later. I would like to talk about one of the first reports that was ever produced in this parliament in relation to oil spills. It was the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment and Conservation in September 1978. I believe that some of the findings produced by this report are still relevant today. Recommendation No. 1 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the increasing importation of oil and refined products to Australia, there is a serious threat of larger and more frequent oil spills.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members should remember this was written in 1978. It went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The likelihood of an oil spill disaster depends largely on the performance of the people involved in the industry, both on land and sea, and the standard and maintenance of equipment. The ability to cope adequately with an oil spill disaster depends largely on the location of the spill.</PARA>
<PARA>I will get back to the issue of Westernport Bay soon and refer to the problems that could occur if there were an oil spill in that most beautiful part of Australia. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is the body charged with cleaning up these oil spills. It is also the body that will receive this money collected from the oil companies. In its annual report of 1992-93, there was about 1 1/2 pages devoted to oil spills. One paragraph in this report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the 234 sighting reports of marine oil pollution, 109 were known to be ship-sourced.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that it is talking about 1992-93. So there are 234 sightings of marine oil pollution. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over 54 per cent of the incidents occurred within port limits where cleanup action was taken by the port authority or relevant oil terminal. The remainder of the incidents occurred offshore and did not pose a threat to the coastline and consequently required little or no further cleanup action other than an initial threat assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the national plan the response to one major oil spill, that of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ira</EMPHASIS> in 1992, was successful. Due to the prevailing conditions, containment booms were not able to be used. Dispersants were applied to the spill and, in accordance with current dispersant policy, oil in mangrove areas was left to degrade naturally. Considering the conditions, the response was regarded as the most effective for this incident. It was said about this incident that `due to the prevailing condition containment booms were unable to be used'. I will refer to that again in a moment in relation to Westernport Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the environment committee had before it the executives of AMSA. We were questioning them about various oil spills and threats of oil spills, not only to Westernport Bay but to the Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia and to the Great Barrier Reef. I asked them whether the ships that had been chartered by Australian companies were sound and up to maritime standards. The reply was that these ships were sound and seaworthy and had been chartered by very reputable companies such as BP, Mobil, Shell and Ampol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reminded them that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> happened to have been chartered by BP and the front had broken off it. It was certainly a bodgy ship. BP is a reputable company, but it did not pick up the fact that its ship definitely was not seaworthy. It spilt thousands of tonnes of oil into the Indian Ocean. Luckily it did not blow onto the shore. It blew off into the Indian Ocean and probably evaporated&mdash;or whatever happens to oil when it spreads out over the sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe we can trust these so-called reputable companies to charter ships that are safe and have had all their checks. In the past&mdash;we have only to look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>&mdash;we know they have not done it. The ships should be looked at very closely.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest attractions for tourists in Victoria is the penguin parade at Phillip Island, the gateway to Westernport Bay. I would like to read to honourable members about a little incident that happened in Victoria in 1990. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper of 26 May 1990 it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conservations officials believe several hundred penguins have probably been killed by the oil slick that has washed up on beaches from Warrnambool to Skenes Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least 104 fairy penguins are confirmed to have died after being caught in the slick.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that it was not known which ship had discharged the oil but officials were looking for it. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in June 1993 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the coast around Apollo Bay was contaminated with oil two years ago, 160 penguins were retrieved; half of these were saved at a cost of $60,000 a bird&mdash;the real cost was masked by the input of volunteer labor.</PARA>
<PARA>That amount was $60,000 per bird. This is why I believe that we should not have just 6c a tonne levied on the oil companies; it should be double that amount. A report from 30 June 1993 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A subsidiary company of petroleum giant Caltex was yesterday fined $60,000 for causing an oil slick off the Victorian coast three years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A County Court judge imposed the fine on Caltex Tanker Company (Aust) Pty Ltd after finding it had been negligent in failing to provide regular maintenance of . . . the ship . . . </PARA>

<PARA>So the Caltex company was fined $60,000. That was the cost of reviving and saving one penguin. An advertisement in the newspaper recently said, `Phillip Island&mdash;the Anchor Seaside Retreat, 1 The Esplanade, Cowes. Turn my popularity into your profits'. There is a photograph of penguins. It goes on, `Here is your opportunity to profit from the 500,000 tourists who visit Phillip Island each year'. Just imagine if that penguin parade had been wiped out by one of these tankers that regularly ply Westernport Bay: 500,000 tourists a year would be gone. That would certainly make a bit of a dint in the budget of the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of activity in Westernport Bay. Many groups there have been involved in stopping a development which would have increased the amount of tanker traffic. The groups range from community groups, scientists, environmentalists and even federal politicians. Recently we had a bit of a shock. We had been fighting this matter for over 12 months and believed that Shell-Mobil was about to start work on the old BP site there. However, Shell-Mobil will delay plans to develop an oil storage plant at Crib Point for 12 months, amid calls from environmental and fishing groups for the federal government to intervene. Shell-Mobil's Crib Point terminal project manager, Mr Jim MacKinnon, said that work due to start next month had been postposed for at least a year to release money for other projects. He said this on 1 December 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have effectively delayed the construction of this plant and, therefore, the transport of ships up and down the bay. That has not come about because the residents of Phillip Island or around Westernport Bay have been sitting on their hands. They have been very active. There has been a lot of very vocal opposition to this proposal. One of the people who have been very active is Mr Peter Carroll from Shoreham. He has written to me, discussing some of the problems that could occur if these ships go up Westernport Bay. I would like to mention some of them. He heads his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Marine Organisms in Ballast Water&mdash;Translocation of toxic . . . (algae) from Port Phillip Bay to Westernport Bay.</PARA>
<PARA>Some honourable members may be aware of the red tide we have had in Port Phillip Bay over the last few years. That is toxic algae&mdash;which is not in Westernport Bay. However, if these ships going to the Crib Point Terminal went from Westernport to Port Phillip Bay&mdash;which they were going to do&mdash;this toxic algae would get around. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service . . . is responsible for vessels entering Australian ports from overseas. Ballast water is part of the vessels practique, though most may not be signatories to the voluntary guidelines of the International Marine Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There appear to be no guidelines or controls by state agencies to minimise the potential impact of translocating marine organisms, particularly toxic&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>algae&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and possibly cholera pathogens (not detected here yet).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opinion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Carroll's opinion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(and other scientific opinion) there is a real potential for translocation of toxic marine organisms from Port Phillip Bay to Westernport Bay, in tanker ballast water, by the Shell/Mobil proposed activity of transferring oil from . . . (Crib Point Terminal project) to Altona and Geelong. The risk is in the probable need to deballast in WB prior to reloading oil for the transfer to PPB. It is essential that appropriate controls and regulations exist before the activity occurs.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on with other suggestions. He has asked me a series of questions in relation to the Shell-Mobil project and whether the project is really in the national interest. He has asked me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What monies are remitted back to the parent companies overseas?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What return on investment is expected from this new activity of crude oil importation, and export of refined product?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How many new jobs (short and long term) will be created by the activity?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will they receive a tax rebate, or any other benefit from the public purse, for the export of refined product?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What taxes and other charges do they contribute now?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What taxes and other charges (rates, rents etc) are expected to accrue from the new activity?</PARA>
<PARA>I will endeavour to find out the answers to those questions. But I think it is important that people are aware that we do not have to have overseas tankers bringing in toxic algae in their ballasts; we can actually transfer it from Port Phillip Bay back to Westernport Bay. Westernport Bay, of course, is a different bay from Port Phillip Bay with regard to the amount of tidal activity, the height of the tides and the speed of the water leaving the bay, because of the narrowness of the exits there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned before that the AMSA report stated that container booms were not able to be used because of the weather conditions. The tide in Westernport Bay is about 10 to 12 knots. Those booms would not work there, either. So the oil would float out to who knows where in Westernport Bay. Of course, it would destroy the penguin parade in that area. As we know, 18 tonnes of oil killed hundreds of penguins in the Lorne area, where there is open water. Just imagine what it would do at Nobbies Entrance at Westernport Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, as I said before, only charges the oil companies six cents per tonne. I think it should be at least double that amount. We should build up a huge amount of money. One has only to look at the oil spills overseas and the huge cost of fixing them up. Therefore, we should have a trust fund which would allow AMSA to buy the latest equipment. The equipment should not just be based at Geelong and flown out to other areas if there is an oil spill; it should be based all over Australia in critical areas like the Ningaloo Reef on the Great Barrier Reef, and also at Westernport Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this delay by Shell-Mobil in the refurbishment of the tanks at Crib Point should enable the federal government to step in and ask the companies to do an environmental impact study. Mr Mackinnon who, as I said before, is the spokesman for Shell-Mobil, attended a meeting recently and, in relation to a study, is reported in a newspaper article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Jim Mackinnon told the meeting his company would not call for either a study or an assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"It has always been our view that such a study is not necessary", Mr Mackinnon said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"However, if the commonwealth or state authorities should require CPT to carry out such an assessment, we would willingly participate".</PARA>
<PARA>Crib Point terminals has said it would willingly participate in a study. I think this is an open invitation to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to ask these companies to carry out an environmental impact study. There is no real urgency now. They have got 12 months before they will even start work. I believe this is the correct time to do it. I do not know why they have not gone ahead with it. Maybe it was because of the pressure brought to bear by the environmental movement and the residents in this area. If so, I congratulate them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, one never knows with oil companies. As I said, I have been suspicious since 1983 when I first became a member of this House as to the motives of oil companies.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall that in 1984 I made a speech in relation to Westernport Bay and oil tankers which anchored in Westernport Bay. They have huge anchors weighing 50 tonnes, 100 tonnes&mdash;who knows how much&mdash;and they drop them straight down onto the bed of Westernport Bay. This creates a huge amount of turbulence and muddies the water. The seagrass in Westernport Bay has died off&mdash;not completely, but huge amounts have died off since I used to swim there when I was a teenager. Even at the pier from which I used to fish, where there used to be a huge area of seagrass, it has now all gone. Who knows whether it is because of turbulence caused by these oil tanker anchors. What I can say is that once Crib Point opened, a few years later the seagrass of Westernport Bay died very rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important piece of legislation. I am glad it has the agreement of those on both sides of the House.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can't use Tullamarine and it is nonsense to suggest that it could take additional traffic from Essendon. Moorabbin is appropriate for destinations on the south eastern side of the metropolitan area, but it is not a substitute for Essendon.</PARA>

We were able to see it and join in the spirit of it. It was a very special night. There were not a lot of boring speeches, but the speeches that were given were sincere and relatively short. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I spoke on Tuesday night about the proposed takeover of Tate and Lyle, and I return to the subject this evening because it is of such great importance not only to North Queensland but to the economy of Australia. I am talking here of potentially some $400 million a year in production going to a foreign company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The South Johnstone mill has spent $30 million in capital expenditure over the last 14 years, and increased its crushing rate from approximately 380 tonnes per hour to a capability which will allow 500 tonnes per hour. This capital expenditure was used to improve milling capacity, sugar quality and recovery aspects, and also reduce lost crushing time to the extent where in 1993 South Johnstone mill achieved lost time excluding weather of 3.3 percent and only 1.3 percent of this time was due to mechanical failure&mdash;surely an excellent performance in anyone's books. Should this company be taken over by Tate and Lyle, performance will deteriorate to the detriment of cane farmers. A similar performance was recorded by the Tully mill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The performance of Tate and Lyle mills in Australia demonstrates that the management philosophy in that organisation is deficient in some way. I emphasise that these mills were working quite well until the takeover by Tate and Lyle and were the equal of any other mills&mdash;both management and workers were doing an excellent job&mdash;but they are now operating under the sort of expenditure restraints which have caused this takeover situation to arise. Surely Tate and Lyle should not be allowed to extend its clear lack of ability to efficiently manage raw sugar mills. It is of far more importance to the nation to allow these mills to continue under the current directorate or leadership, and indeed Tate &amp; Lyle should be encouraged to exit the Queensland industry so that the existing industry can be utilised in a much more efficient manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can it be possible for an organisation such as Tate and Lyle to take over other mills when, in a presentation to South Johnstone mill, Mr Mitchell of Bundaberg Sugar indicated that he knew nothing about an expansion into the tableland area by South Johnstone mill and had not considered the future of this expansion in the lead-up to the presentation of the Part A Statement. Indeed, Mr Mitchell is a member of the board of the Queensland Sugar Corporation and should have been well aware of the intentions of South Johnstone mill in this particular field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Mitchell also pleaded ignorance of the fact that the 1992-93 financial statements of South Johnstone Mill showed a cash reserve of $12.3 million. It seems inconceivable that Mr Mitchell's advisers did not understand that we had $12.3 million in cash reserves as at 30 June 1993. With this takeover, of course, the company will be able to help itself to those cash reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With these exhibited misunderstandings of the true situation at South Johnstone, how could this organisation effectively run two other sugar mills in North Queensland in a successful manner. If the takeover bid is successful it would be `really fantastic for Tate and Lyle', but certainly not for South Johnstone shareholders and the farmers, with the shareholders being paid cash which their company has accumulated to the tune of some $20 million when profits and cash flow from the 1993 crushing season estimated at $7.5 million is included. This is indeed a ridiculous takeover bid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tate and Lyle clearly wish to achieve something for nothing. Our financial advice indicates that if the bid is successful, Tate and Lyle would have a return on investment of 25 to 26 per cent and a pay back in cash from its own resources within a two- to three-year period. The takeover offer is clearly absurd and must reflect the absurdity of the so mentioned company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should the takeover bid be successful, Tate and Lyle would have the strategic advantage in the region of four sugar mills, and this strategic advantage is not being allowed for in the amount offered for the shares in South Johnstone Mill Ltd. Nor does it allow for the expansion of these mills. An additional strategic advantage would be the exclusive use of the Mourilyan Harbour facilities&mdash;which have been paid for in most part by taxpayers&mdash;for the dispatch of raw sugar. Should the industry be deregulated after review of the Sugar Industry Act in 1996, and the takeover bid is successful, Tate and Lyle will have exclusive use of Mourilyan Bulk Terminal facilities to dispatch sugar produced from their mills to whatever market they have arranged and be in a position to not share this price with the growers supplying the cane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With virtually unlimited expansion now available in the industry in this area, Tully not only has available Bankers Trust `King Ranch' holdings land but also the forestry department's pine forest, which has now matured for harvesting&mdash;this plus adjacent undeveloped land would open up as much as 20,000 hectares of land for cane production&mdash;a significant increase in the entire crop for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to point out to the House this evening that, in its submission to the FIRB, Sugar North noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The balance sheets of all member mills of Sugar North are very healthy. There is no net benefit to Australia flowing from&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this takeover. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, examination of the Tate &amp; Lyle balance sheet shows relatively high gearing (89% at 26 September 1992).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say, in fairness, that I have seen other reports that say it is 60 per cent. But whether we accept the figure of 60 or 89 per cent, we are talking about an extremely high and precarious gearing level. This submission continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this gearing would rise considerably and increase their net borrowings position from #641.9 million equivalent to A$1.46 Bn. Acquisition would also provide the buyer with access to a substantial amount of cash which the mills have accumulated for reinvestment in their own activities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1992 the Kennett Liberal government was elected to power in Victoria and proceeded with one of the most vicious assaults on the living standards of ordinary working people that my state has ever seen. No more deeply was that assault felt than in the Geelong region and my electorate of Corio in particular, which has a high concentration of low income earners and pensioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four housewives, in their anger and frustration at this assault on their families' living standards, walked off the street to seek advice from those who understood the political process on ways ordinary working men and women might oppose these inequitable policies. Their discussions with family and neighbours unearthed real fear for their future under this mindless, heartless and uncaring state government. They decided to hold a public meeting of concerned women in Geelong. At that meeting, attended by over 100 women in Geelong, an organisation was born called Housewives United. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the first tentative step into the public arena by those four woman who had never entered that zone before. They had little experience of organising or chairing public meetings, or the resources to sustain any further activity. All they had was a burning desire to protect their families from the rather rotten policies of this conservative state government. Housewives United grew rapidly in Geelong and, as other communities in regional and urban Victoria reeled from the jackboot assault by Kennett on their liberty and living standards, they turned to Housewives United and those four women for support and, indeed, hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The organisation grew in other communities and today has a membership of over 3,000 people. It has now become, with a new name, People United. It is an extraordinary tale of courage, commitment and dedication by working people to one another. But, for the four women concerned, it has been a personally liberating experience. They have learnt that politics is not what it seems to be from the outside; they have learnt new skills; they have met other inspiring working women and men; and they have refused to cower or be intimidated by this repressive government. They have grown personally stronger in their own lives with the passage of the days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell this story in the House tonight as we move towards that rather spiritually inspiring time of the year so that the story of People United will give heart and hope to all working people in my electorate and throughout the state of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no stone left unturned, no sacrifice too great, no skill left unexploited and no resource left unused in the quest by working people in Geelong and in Victoria to rid the state of this political cancer that is consuming the heart of this great state&mdash;namely, the Victorian conservative government. The prosperity of Victoria will return to the state, despite Jeff Kennett and the policies of his government. The work of concerned organisations such as People United will continue until we have a government again in Spring Street that can demonstrate some compassion for working families in the state of Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to conclude my remarks on an issue which is of such vital importance to the sugar industry, to the Australian economy and to our area. The difficulty with the sugar industry that arises if Tate and Lyle takes this&mdash;it is with deep regret in this House that all three parties have a policy of deregulation of the sugar industry&mdash;is that we will have a monopoly pricing mechanism between the farmers and between the mills. I do not think people in this House, when they advocate deregulation, even remotely understand that most of our primary producers have only one buyer&mdash;whether it is the local dairy cooperative or dairy company, the sugar mill or the meatworks, the area usually has only one. Sugar producers do not have the ability to move the product up the road to the next mill, so they either take the price that they are given or they go into some other commodity, which is virtually impossible for people in the super wet belt&mdash;the area which I am talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, many of them have gone back into growing bananas and that has imposed itself upon the banana industry of New South Wales and gone a long way to destroying that very viable industry that once existed there. These people do not want to get out of the sugar industry, but if deregulation&mdash;and that is the policy of every party in this House, I deeply regret to say&mdash;is on its way, they are also on their way out of cane and into bananas. That will cause a net loss to the Australian economy because we cannot export bananas. We can, and we did, export the sugar that was produced in these areas previously. I must emphasise to the House the real, basic, underlying reason why we are trenchantly opposed to the takeover by Tate and Lyle; if deregulation is on its way, if farmers own the mills, they do not have to worry about deregulation in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most unfortunate for Ingham and Ayr and those areas which are under corporate ownership now, but at least we would be relatively safe in the super wet belt. But even here we will not be safe if Tate and Lyle takes over these mills. The influence of GATT means that there is no reduction in the subsidies in Europe or the United States&mdash;Europe is the big player in the sugar industry. There has been no agreement under GATT for the reduction of these subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means we will be competing against the slave labour wage levels of the big corporate farmers in Central America. Even if the workers do not like these wage levels, the farmers seem to have a lot of influence with the government and the people are kept at the tiller for nothing. Those slave labour wage levels will be imported into Australia via GATT, which has opened the door. Alternatively, these industries will cease to exist completely. As far as I can see, in these areas we have a choice of either having no sugar industry or having people working for nothing, as they are in Central America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people in the sugar-growing areas are in a very serious financial situation because of the demise of agriculture in Australia via the excessive interest rates that have been imposed upon every agricultural industry. I plead with those people who have to sell to do so to other farmers in the area so that Tate and Lyle does not get their shares. There are people waiting to buy those shares at a similar price. I also plead with those people who have to sell to at least attempt to hold out for a reasonable price from Tate and Lyle if they must in fact sell to that company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are other buyers out there; there is no necessity to sell to Tate and Lyle. We urge them not to turn our country back to where it was at the end of the last century, with what were then called the `imperialist' companies controlling the industry in all of these areas while we cut cane in the mud amongst the Taipan snakes, crocodiles and floods for virtually nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And that is really what it was like. Burning was introduced to rid the canefields of the snakes, but that came later. It was not initially a practice on the canefields. These people worked in the fields and they worked for nothing. That is what we will return to if we have a situation of deregulation coupled with the takeover of these mills by foreigners. If there were ever a case where the FIRB should intervene, it is this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay very great tribute to the battlers up there who are fighting tooth and nail to see that we do not return to the Stone Age. They are people such as George Despot, George Taifalos, Fred Lizzio, Reno Cargnello, Dennis Stevenson, Graham Patch, Delmo Tarditi, Scott Grimley and Don Watson. They are enormously capable people and people whom I am quite confident will win in the long run. But they have to get some assistance from this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to pursue this morning the important and perplexing issue which was raised yesterday in this parliament by the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), and more recently by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), concerning the quite extraordinary events in Victoria arising from the activities of the Victorian Attorney-General in relation to the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Victoria, Mr Bernard Bongiorno.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances of this matter, which are of grave concern, were adequately dealt with in the contribution by the honourable member for McEwen. The aspect which I wish to deal with, however, raises equally important but distinct issues. In recent days, following the leaking to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> of a copy of the Victorian government's DPP amendment bill, the Attorney-General has required the Victorian police to investigate the sources of the alleged leak. Aside from Attorney-General Wade's quite extraordinary actions in this matter, a much more serious aspect has now emerged to which I want to refer this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that yesterday at about 2.30 p.m. the Victorian police sought to interrogate the shadow Attorney-General, the state member for Melbourne, Mr Neil Cole. In that interview, the police apparently indicated that their interest in Mr Cole had sprung from questions he had asked in the Victorian House of Assembly and they sought to question him on the source of the information in those questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is hard to imagine a more gross breach of privilege. Any student of parliamentary history and powers would know well that police interfering or intimidating MPs is about as grave a breach as is possible to imagine. Sadly, such abuse of power is becoming par for the course in Victoria, where Attorney-General Wade has time and again now shown herself incapable of carrying out her office in the proper quasi-judicial and impartial way that an Attorney-General should act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised this matter tonight in the hope that lawyers and others across the nation will be repulsed to hear of these happenings and will join in ringing condemnation of the Victorian government's actions in seeking to interrogate an MP over his parliamentary duties and its interference with the independence of the judiciary and of the DPP. I sincerely hope that this will not be the last that we hear of these matters and that they will be taken up properly in the appropriate place at the appropriate time&mdash;which is, of course, in the Victorian parliament&mdash;and be treated most seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every student of parliamentary history would know perfectly well that the idea that members in any way should have their activities interfered with by police is the most serious type of breach that one can imagine. I say to all people in this nation who are concerned with proper rights and freedoms that this is a terrible breach, if the circumstances are as have been reported to me. I hope that all citizens of goodwill, and all people who are able to have their voices heard in this matter, will raise their voices in justified concern about what apparently has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It not only appears to be a breach of privilege by the police but also a breach of privilege by the Victorian Attorney-General who apparently authorised this particular action by the police. I simply say to members of the House that each and every one of us should be gravely concerned to hear of this matter. I hope that the matter is properly investigated over the next few days and weeks and appropriate action is taken to ensure that anybody who believes that this action is appropriate is brought to book, and the sooner the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government was advised that Xanana was moved from Dili to a prison in Semarang, Central Java on 13 August. He was moved from Semarang to Cipinang prison in Jakarta on 30 September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) resumed its program of visits to East Timorese detainees in early August 1993, having suspended that program first in May and then in June this year.  The ICRC has a local office in East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Xanana's purported successor, Mauhunu, has reportedly been released from detention in East Timor. The Government understands Mauhudu, Xanana's former deputy, is not in detention but under house arrest.  The Australian Embassy in Jakarta has been following up these cases, and continues to make representations about all East Timorese who are in detention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Government has been informed by the Indonesian authorities that of around 40 East Timorese who demonstrated outside a cathedral during the visit of the Papal Nuncio to East Timor in July this year, about 12 were detained and that they have since been released.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Government continues to urge the Indonesian Government to grant access to East Timor by, for example, parliamentarians, the media, and human rights organisations. The Government welcomes the access to East Timor given to the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy to East Timor, Amos Wako. A UN observer, local and international human rights organisations, and local and foreign media were all given access to East Timor to attend Xanana's trial. Officers of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta  also attended the trial. Embassy officers make regular visits to East Timor.  US Congressional aides have recently visited the province.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Government supports the efforts of the UN Secretary General (UNSG) to help Indonesia and Portugal reconcile their differences over East Timor, through the Indonesia&mdash;Portugal talks on East Timor under UNSG auspices. The Government believes that the question of parties to these talks is one to be agreed between Indonesia, Portugal, and the UN Secretary General. The Government welcomes the outcome of the most recent round of the Indonesia&mdash;Portugal talks, in particular, the consideration of possible confidence&mdash;building measures and the affirmation of the need to facilitate access to East Timor by UN, human rights, and humanitarian organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The development of broader and more diverse links between Australia and Indonesia in recent years has enabled the Government to conduct a frank and productive dialogue with the Indonesian authorities, including at the highest levels of Government, on human rights issues and including the situation in East Timor. The Government's ability to raise issues concerning East Timor in a persistent manner at the highest levels of the Indonesian Government, and to receive prompt responses, results from this broadly based approach to the relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Current co&mdash;operative defence activities with Indonesia include ship and aircraft visits, combined naval exercises, Indonesian observers at Australian land exercises and exercise planning conferences, training and some consultancy assistance by the ADF, reciprocal study visits, and personnel exchanges in shared areas of military interest, survey and logistics operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) Yes. As part of its development co&mdash;operation program with Indonesia, Australia is assisting the Government of Indonesia with the provision of an affordable water supply and sanitation services to approximately 100,000 people living in and around Dili and the town of Suai on the southern coast of the province. This assistance is being delivered through the five year Indonesia/Australia East Timor Water Supply and Sanitation Project, which began in October 1992. The total project cost is estimated at $18 million, of which Australia's contribution is $11.95 million. Project implementation is being managed on behalf of AIDAB by a joint venture of Scott and Furphy Pty Ltd and Coffey MPW Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Project performance is being monitored closely through regular field visits to the project by AIDAB officers from the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and through six&mdash;monthly project progress assessments conducted  by the Project Co&mdash;ordination Board (PCB).

These briefings were, as a matter of course, discussed with my Ministerial advisers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) There is no manual produced by the Department entitled `The Threat'. The manual to which the honourable member refers is the Australian Army Manual of Land Warfare Part 1, Volume 3, Pamphlet No 2, Aid to the Civil Power. It was issued in 1983 as a restricted training pamphlet on the same basis as all other restricted training pamphlets and is used by Australian Army officers and non-commissioned officers engaged in training. The Manual of Land Warfare is a generic title which covers the whole range of operations that the land forces might be called upon to conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All volumes in the Manual of Land Warfare are subject to review on a periodic basis. Other volumes, such as the one on Peacekeeping, are being written and re-written and attract a much higher priority than this particular training manual&mdash;noting there is a current directive which prohibits training aimed at controlling Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manual is still applicable to some training. Parts of  it deal with the legal considerations involving procedures for call-out, requisitions and requests which can be applicable to a counter-terrorist situation if a state government asks for assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The manual is classified Restricted in accordance with normal Defence practice to protect Defence information.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) &amp; (iii)  Yes. Description of basic tactical formations used to effect dispersal of riotous crowds, conditions requiring use of force, and when to consider the use of force is contained in this manual.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Yes. As part of routine distribution of Army manuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) No. Material classified as Restricted is not issued to the public. I see no reason to make the manual available to Members of Parliament as the Defence Force does not carry out training which is aimed at controlling Australian citizens.
