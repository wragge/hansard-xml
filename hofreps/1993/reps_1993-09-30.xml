<TITLE>Medicare Benefits for Optometric Examinations</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the schedule fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered.</PARA>

He is now the chair of the subcommittee that prepared the report. A lot of the work was done during the previous parliament, and I thank him for his courtesy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I know, this is the first report by this parliament on the major international financial institutions, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The report has been in preparation for over two years; in fact, it would have been tabled about six months ago if the election had not intervened. In 1991 the committee proposed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, that an inquiry to examine Australia's relationship with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund be held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For countries like Australia, membership of the bank and the fund offer both the potential to influence their policies and the opportunity to export Australian goods and services to developing countries under their programs. However, to date Australia has failed to capitalise adequately on either of these two types of opportunities offered by membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its 1989 report on third world debt, the committee examined the impact of international financial institutions, through IFI adjustment programs, on developing countries. The committee recognised that, while the primary responsibility for economic policy lies with recipient country governments, the bank and the fund have considerable power to influence those governments. Since the committee's 1989 report was published, the bank has accepted the need to address issues such as poverty and the environment as a necessary part of its policy of growth through structural adjustment. Whilst acknowledging that the bank is attempting to deal with these issues, many witnesses and commentators consider that the change in actual policies has been inadequate, and called on Australia to play a much more active role in influencing bank and fund policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Particular areas of concern addressed by witnesses to the inquiry were the failure of the bank and the fund to lead a process of major debt reduction for severely indebted countries; the social problems created by the current focus of both the bank and the fund on structural adjustment loans; the failure of the bank and the fund to address cross-sectoral issues such as unemployment, inequity, poverty, population growth, land redistribution and environmental issues in developing countries; the failure of the bank or the fund to learn from its mistakes adequately through program evaluation; and the dominance of the fund and the bank by industrialised countries with a particularly narrow and naively theoretical philosophy of unconstrained markets, regardless of the extent of market failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee addressed each of these areas of concern and concluded that there was at least some validity in all of them, and we made a series of recommendations about the effectiveness of fund and bank policies aimed at addressing them. For example, our recommendation No. 25 urged that the bank and the fund strengthen the advice that they give to recipient countries during loan negotiations dealing with poverty, population growth, land redistribution and the environment. We urged more effective evaluation of their programs to see whether they are in fact working. Of course, the bank and the fund do that, but we urged them to extend that approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We urged that member countries support the issue of special drawing rights. I was profoundly concerned to see that Australia at present is not amongst those governments which are supporting the issue of special drawing rights. A new issue of SDRs would be of direct benefit to developing countries in easing their current account constraints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also urged Australia's executive directors to take more initiative in the development of bank and fund policies. There is a tendency, it would seem, amongst our executive directors to be extremely cautious in the kinds of involvement they have in policy development within the bank and the fund, and we urged them to inform themselves better on the needs of the developing countries, the recipient countries themselves, and to be more active in urging more sensitive policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also recommend that the link between the bank's capital base and its lending, which is on a one-for-one basis at present, be broken so that the resources that it can lend to developing countries can be increased in ways other than by simply increasing its capital base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade believes that membership of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund has considerable benefits for Australia. That membership provides the opportunity to participate as an active member of the international economic and financial system and to influence the multilateral development banks' policies so as to increase the effectiveness and equity of those policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Membership also provides opportunities on a regional level for Australia to encourage bank and fund involvement in South-East Asia and the South Pacific, thereby enhancing our regional bilateral development programs. Australia is also able to participate in the development debate in our region through the World Bank's research into the economies of this region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the commercial activities of the World Bank, involvement in bank financed business opportunities can help Australian firms in becoming established and to serve export markets in developing countries, including in the Asian region. From a commercial perspective, therefore, the benefit to be gained from Australia's membership is the opportunity to participate in the procurement of goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this area Australian service providers such as consultants and engineering firms perform better than our manufacturers. There are a number of reasons for this, not least of which is Australia's technical excellence in the fields demanded by the World Bank and the approach taken by service providers. The committee has made a number of recommendations about ways of strengthening Australia's commercial involvement in World Bank activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another theme of the report is the need to increase the openness of bank activities, and the committee makes a number of suggestions for dealing with that. Perhaps the most original suggestion is for the establishment of an interparliamentary assembly to monitor the fund and the bank. The committee proposes that that should meet annually; that the meetings should be organised through, perhaps, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund; that membership should come from countries which currently provide the executive directors for the bank and the fund; and that the Speaker and the President of the Australian Parliament should take the initiative in organising a preliminary meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also states that it is very important that the policy of widely advertising the positions of executive directors in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund be continued. We applaud the Treasury for opening up those advertisements, but we urge that the selection process should ensure that strong weight be given to experience in development finance issues. That should be through the selection criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was also concerned about the increase in the proportion of Australia's aid program which goes through the international financial institutions. The committee supports that and it would, of course, like to see the aid program increased, but it recommends that that portion of the aid program going through the multilateral development banks should be separated out as a component of the aid budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to thank the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in both the 36th and 37th parliaments, and particularly the current chair of the subcommittee, the honourable member for Werriwa. All members of the subcommittee participated actively. It was a very interesting and valuable inquiry. I warmly thank the members of the committee secretariat, particularly Cheryl Samuels and Marina Ellis, for their work. It was a quite difficult and technical inquiry and they worked very hard at it. I am very grateful for their work. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very appropriate that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) table the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund</EMPHASIS> because, in the previous parliament, he chaired the subcommittee, did most of the work and involved himself very heavily in it. The honourable member also has a lot of experience in, and academic and practical knowledge of, the issues surrounding aid and development cooperation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not my intention to speak today. I had assumed that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) would be here. He expressed to both the honourable member for Fraser and me his wish to speak on behalf of the opposition; and he too, of course, was involved in this committee right through the last parliament and was very heavily involved in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what I have learnt from all my colleagues on the committee, there were a lot of very strong opinions about the bank. There was evidence of contentions and allegations in various places but, in others, evidence, knowledge and information were lacking. This says a lot in itself, inasmuch as the bank hitherto has not exposed itself to the degree of scrutiny that the committee clearly sees as being necessary. It is one thing to attack the bank's operations on first principles but, since we are in a heavily ideological area and in an area where there will always be a very strong debate about development issues, it is very important that there be full scrutiny, given the amount of money that the taxpayers are putting in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My involvement with the bank when I was minister for primary industry was really in terms of visiting the bank when I was in Washington&mdash;where I was given some insight into the work being done by Australians in the World Bank&mdash;and also in terms of directors reporting to me on my way through. As Treasurer, I attended the World Bank and IMF meeting in Bangkok in 1991. Most of my work then was done in two committees over the weekend, and consisted of a day's work on the development committee and another day on another committee, the name of which now escapes me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those meetings were very active, open and interactive, and there was real debate in them. But US views&mdash;or what I would call a banker's ascetic view of the world&mdash;tended to be the dominant ideology. One would see some of the developing nations and the donor nations divide. Australia, being the sort of middle power it is could play a bridging role, as we so often do in international fora. I did not give a speech to the plenary session. I think it was intended by my officials that I give a vacuous speech. I remember helping the Mongolian delegate write his speech. Seeing that he could not speak English and I could not speak Mongolian, that was not a very effective exercise, but he gave a speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech that I did not give&mdash;we did table something in the plenary session&mdash;said that Australia was going through the worst recession in 60 years. Although I did not say it, I certainly believe that I have to be responsible. That speech was boxed, and the person in Treasury who wrote it was looking at one out of four relevant measures. I will not debate whether at that exact time we were in the worst recession for 60 years. That is history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Bank, with the IMF agency as part of it and with the International Development Association, is part of a spectrum of development cooperation assistance given to the developing world. The IMF's role has diminished somewhat since the collapse of Bretton Woods. It is now an agency which tries to impose conditionality and tries to give advice to governments on the way they see fit to run their economies. The IMF often clashes with governments of developing countries, because the political realities in those countries do not square with what is seen as the proper way to go about things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Bank is very much at one end of the aid spectrum inasmuch as we are dealing with long-term finance, and dealing commercially. We are dealing with loans of up to 40 years. The IDA does a lot better work. There are other banking agencies such as the Asian Development Bank and the African Development Bank. I attended a meeting as Australia's representative of the Asian Development Bank last year in Hong Kong. The position that Australia took there was that it was about time that the embargo on Vietnam was dropped and that Vietnam be allowed to receive funds. This is something that I think most Australians would feel rather strongly about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a long time since the Vietnam War ended but, again, this shows that the World Bank has a US dominance. Australia, in again taking the bridging role, pointed out that just because there was a domestic political issue Vietnam should not be denied the international assistance that other developing countries are given. We have seen plenty of areas where the victor has helped the vanquished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these international agencies suffer the same deficiencies as any international bureaucracy. In terms of the administration of the funds, AIDAB, our own aid agency, is actually about 3.8 times more efficient. The non-government organisations are the ones that most stridently oppose much of the work, or some of the work, of the World Bank. NGOs are a lot more flexible, of course, than a body like the World Bank and governments, including the Australian government. The World Bank has to deal government to government, while NGOs can actually deal with the people on the ground. Some of the views of the NGOs are accepted uncritically, but the NGOs are not monolithic and they really do cover a wide spectrum of aid. At least they do constantly concentrate on poverty and the real issues in development and are constantly there as a check and a balance and a continuation of the debate which is so essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My objection to the World Bank and the way Australia deals with it is that because departments of treasury and finance, in the donor countries particularly, are the ones concerned with the World Bank it becomes a closed shop or a closed order. I accept the line that a bank is a bank, but our own banking system has shown that if this is regarded as something that is not subject to scrutiny one can get into a lot of trouble&mdash;ask John Bannon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole question of conditionality is a very difficult one. Conditionality in human rights, conditionality in terms of macro-economics are all difficult for a bank. I accept that confidentiality of assessments is needed when the bank is making assessments about countries, but that does not mean that the views of the bank should not be identified by the donors, should not be identified at World Bank meetings and should not be subject to scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the US view of the world since the cold war&mdash;particularly with respect to republican administrations; I do not know about the present administration in the US&mdash;a spokesman for the US at the World Bank meeting I attended said quite clearly that it is no longer a question of how much money the United States puts into development. They actually put in a very small amount compared with other countries in the OECD, but they really see it as a matter of whether or not countries are going to have democratic systems, market systems, and adopt family values. Of course, in Australia we would point out that this did not stop them helping formerly anti-communist countries which had none of those attributes. One can point to some of the fiercely anti-communist countries that did not have much to do with democracy or market systems, for that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other objection I have is that the proportion of the aid budget going to the World Bank has been increasing in real terms. It is going to the international agencies, where I think we will always be and we will always do our bit but, in looking at the whole amount that we spend on aid, the arguments of the Department of Treasury and Department of Finance in Australia were always against targets, against many forms of aid, but always accepting the level of contribution. The scrutiny that was applied to AIDAB was never envisaged as having to be applied to the World Bank and this committee clearly does not share that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, Australia gets back about 87-89 per cent of the amount we spend on aid, through whatever means. We do reasonably well in terms of procurement but we can do a lot better and I share exactly the views of my colleague the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) in saying that we could do more. If business people were going through Washington a lot more, if they worked it harder, I think we could do better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the overall conclusions of the committee which the honourable member for Fraser touched on is that there is need for more scrutiny. In my experience representing Australia at a meeting of the World Bank, I really do believe that this is essential. Parliamentary scrutiny has to be more closely directed to the Treasurer's report. We know how busy this parliament is, but we do put in a lot of money; we need a body like the World Bank. However, that is not a reason for it to be a closed order, and the honourable member for Fraser and I will be seeing honourable members about this inter-parliamentary assembly. I thank the committee members and particularly the staff, who did a sterling job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a new member of the 37th parliament I was obviously a new member of the committee. I must say that it was a fascinating experience for me to join a committee which was enriched by the presence of a former treasurer and ministers for trade. There was not only the last speaker, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), but also the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). The right honourable member for New England is not able to be here today but I know he has a great interest in this report. He has a fascinating political background and has a wide knowledge of the world. I must say that I felt privileged to be able to be part of the concluding stages of the report and the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would particularly like to pay tribute also to the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). He was the first chairman and he continued his work in the 37th parliament. His words, direction and leadership are reflected very much and very often in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all that, I must say that I believe that the report is going to be one that will lead to a lot more activity, action and inquiry about the operation of the World Bank. If its sole effectiveness is to do that then it will have done its job very well. The World Bank is indeed a giant. I understand it employs 6,000 to 7,000 personnel. It is present and operates throughout many parts of the world and has a huge responsibility in terms of helping address the problems of poverty. It also helps countries recover from disasters and wars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear the honourable member for Werriwa refer to Vietnam and to the fact that often in history it is the vanquished who have been helped by the victor and so the World Bank's role in Vietnam is seen as being appropriate. I agree that it is appropriate but I wonder whether it is not the victor being helped by the vanquished. I think perhaps it is in many circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very troubled in the short time that I was part of the inquiry, leading to the finalisation of the report, to learn of the lack of scrutiny and the lack of knowledge and information that our parliament has about the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The recommendations in the report are absolutely vital and urgent and must be implemented. The role of the World Bank is not going to diminish in this troubled world for the next 20, 30 or 50 years. It will take an increasing role. Also, I think Australians are entitled to know more about the World Bank because we are a significant shareholder and we are a significant player in the world. Although we are a small country we are influential and respected throughout the world for our contribution towards helping address the problems of impoverished countries and for our efforts to try to achieve peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting too that this report recommending more scrutiny by the parliament and by the departments of government is being released just prior to the 50th anniversary of the United Nations which will take place in 1995. It is good to see that Australia has been honoured with the chairmanship of the planning committee for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, which is very appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would see that the two activities&mdash;the review of the United Nations which inevitably will occur and will be focused when the 50th anniversary occurs, and the recommendation of this report that the parliament and the government take more interest and become more aware of the World Bank's activities and effectiveness&mdash;will together marshal our scarce resources and help address some of the grave problems of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting it bluntly, I do not believe that any member of this parliament, from either side, or any Australian from whatever walk of life would approve of World Bank funding being given to countries which do not respond to the need to strengthen and give human rights to people or being given to those which do not address problems of anarchy and lawlessness. I regret to say that, over the years, inevitably there must have been occasions when World Bank activity has occurred in good faith in countries but has not achieved the necessary cooperation and reaction from the people in power in those countries at the time.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>With all the huffing and puffing that is going on at the moment in the Senate regarding the budget, many very important items that have an effect on the lives of the majority of Victorians have been overlooked. I would like to remind this house and Victorians of a number of them and also use this opportunity to make the House aware of the other Victorian budget and its disastrous consequences for the people of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would first like to speak about our elderly, our veterans and other social security recipients. There are 588,212 pensioners, 83,880 service pensioners and 250,912 social security recipients in Victoria. This adds up to 933,004 people. I will repeat that number so that honourable members get a bit of an idea of the number of people who receive government moneys. I repeat: 933,000. That is about 11 times the number of the people who attended the real football grand final and saw the mighty Bombers win. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these people will receive benefits from this budget. Even though it is very hard to determine the total increase in monetary terms, it would be in the region of $3 a week. If this is correct, the increase to the Victorian economy from this budget, for this group of people alone, is $2,769,000 per week&mdash;that is, approximately $138 million per year. These people do not put their money under the bed; they spend it, and we all benefit&mdash;especially our shops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are benefits besides the financial one. The benefits are increases to the community aged care package to allow older persons to remain in their homes, improved access to respite care, a seniors health card, a Commonwealth dental scheme, a mature age allowance, increased earned income, increases for palliative care, and child-care cash rebates. These benefits will also put millions of dollars into the Victorian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our veterans will benefit as well. They will receive extra funding for hostel development and emergency funding for telephone counselling. Something I am very pleased to say is that there has been a pilot scheme in the Dunkley electorate over the last three years&mdash;that is, the veterans' advice network. It will extend to Geelong, Ballarat and Gippsland, as well as to the Melbourne metropolitan area, from the existing branch office. Staff employed in the network will work with local communities, providing information on education, advocacy and community development focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of the Victorian environment, there are programs, such as Australian Alps National Park, endangered species, ocean reserve 2000, national land care, save the bush, one billion trees, and national wetlands. As well as these programs there are many more of these innovative schemes, which will inject millions of dollars into very important areas. Some of this money will go to community groups, which work long and hard to protect our fragile environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993-94 budget will provide $1.3 billion for labour market program assistance for the unemployed throughout Australia, and $350 million is allocated for Victoria. There is $136 million allocated for TAFE funding. The Commonwealth, through the Department of Employment, Education and Training, will inject millions into the Victorian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Primary Industries and Energy has done a great deal to assist our rural community in Victoria with programs in this budget, such as money for the Murray-Darling Basin; the national landcare program; a program to introduce world best practice in agriculture; expansion of rural counselling; funding to encourage the use of solar heaters; and the abolition of the assets test on the supplementary boarding allowance for isolated children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning of this speech, this budget is good for Victorians. However, the spite and bitterness that have permeated the opposition since it lost the unlosable election is being vented on this budget and therefore on the people of Victoria. It wants to stop the budget. It wants to stop all the benefits I have listed, and the many more that I have not, and try to create a 1975 situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It keeps telling us that it is a conservative party and it swears to uphold the conventions of the country. However, when they cannot get their own way, it is always the conservative parties who will manipulate, cheat and take treacherous actions to achieve their ultimate goal, and that goal is power. Remember 1975: ever since then it has been trying to justify this act of treachery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Liberals block the budget or have the tax cuts delayed, or removed, it will have a disastrous effect on the Victorian economy. In 1991-92 there were 1.1 million people working and earning between $20,000 and $50,000 per year&mdash;51 per cent of all Victorian taxpayers. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stated that the tax cuts were worth approximately $8 to $10 per week: 1.1 million workers by $10 is approximately $10 million per week. I repeat, $10 million per week. Yes, that is right: that is what they are worth and they are worth that to Victoria. If these tax cuts are stopped, $10 million per week will not go into our economy; $10 million per week will not be spent in our small businesses. Honourable members can imagine what effect that will have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These economic troglodytes opposite think that stopping this budget is a smart thing to do. Jeffrey Kennett's Liberal government in Victoria, I am sorry to say, is taxing the people so much that they are leaving: they are shifting to Queensland, and places like that, to get away from him. The Liberal Party is even taxing business. This is the party of business. In Victoria, what does Jeffrey Kennett do? He puts a land tax on small business. Therefore, he is taxing businesses down; they are his natural allies who prop him up all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party is sacking people. It is closing schools and kindergartens; it is closing rail lines; and on and on it goes. It has even got to the stage now that people are being thrown off the work care scheme and on to Commonwealth social security benefits. It is a fact that, if a person has his foot cut off in Victoria, under the Liberals' new accident compensation scheme, it is not considered a serious accident. A person can stand on one leg with his foot cut off at the ankle, and it is not a serious accident. This is the sort of thing that Kennett is doing in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are a few people who are starting to hit back at his budget cuts. Recently, the Premier of Victoria started to attack the Family Court. One of the judges had the temerity to speak out and say that the Victorian budget was bad for young people and for child care in Victoria. Fancy someone speaking out against the Premier of Victoria; how dare he! The bishop attacked the Premier and he got a bit of a burst. Anyone who speaks out against the Kennett government is attacked. There is only one person who can answer and that person is Jeffrey Kennett; all his ministers are gagged; they are not allowed to speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is also closing down ambulance stations. We saw recently that an ambulance could not get to an injured police officer. That police officer died&mdash;it is believed, although it is not certain&mdash;because of the changes that have been made to the ambulance services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) must surely have been jesting&mdash;albeit a rather bitter and cynical jest&mdash;when he submitted this particular item of private members business. What he is suggesting in this motion is almost an impossibility. How can this House note the positive financial and social impact of the budget on the people of Victoria when the sad and unfortunate fact is that there is nothing positive to note? From the moment the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) resumed his seat after delivering his now totally discredited speech on 17 August, it was already apparent to most Australians that the 1993 budget and the words `positive impact' are mutually exclusive terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing that the honourable member for Dunkley has said in this debate today has done anything to change that fact. Furthermore, in this motion, the honourable member for Dunkley has failed to define which version of the budget he is actually referring to. Is it mark 1, mark 2, mark 3 or, for that matter, any other subsequent versions that may yet emerge along the way? Not that this lack of definition is of any real consequence because, despite the improvements and modifications so far forced on the government by the opposition&mdash;and rest assured we intend to keep working on it&mdash;the budget is still, and will doubtless remain, deficient in many significant respects. With the best will in the world one cannot salvage the unsalvageable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us start by examining the impact of the budget on unemployed Victorians. There is no doubt that unemployment is one of the most significant problems facing Australia and Australians today. It is a very real tragedy that so many people cannot find work. In Victoria there are almost a quarter of a million people registered as unemployed and thousands more who are not receiving unemployment benefits but are nonetheless actively seeking employment, or are underemployed. There are many others of all ages and from all walks of life who have given up all hope of ever finding a job. What does this budget do for them? Nothing; nothing at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in unemployment figures for August only serves to confirm the sorry fact that this government has failed to take any positive or constructive measures to assist unemployed Victorians to get back to work. The Treasurer's claim on budget night that `the primary objective of this budget is jobs' has been shown to be little better than a cruel and heartless hoax. Rather than offering any prospect of improvement in the already desperate unemployment situation, this budget reinforces the depressing probability of unemployment remaining at unacceptable levels for the foreseeable future. In fact, the likely impact of some of the anti-business measures in this budget will be to exacerbate this problem. One cannot hope to increase job opportunities in times of economic uncertainty by increasing imposts on business. It just does not work that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me demonstrate this point by examining another of the budget measures that have the potential to impact in a very negative way on many Victorians, particularly in my electorate of Casey which includes the wine making area of the Yarra Valley. I refer of course to the exorbitant and unjustifiable proposed 55 per cent increase in the sales tax on wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr David Wollan, the Managing Director of the Tarrawarra Vineyard, Yarra Glen, has written to me about this matter. Unfortunately, the anticipated financial and social impacts identified by Mr Wollan are certainly not of the positive variety. I quote some extracts from his letter:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have spent a small fortune developing markets in the USA, UK, Japan, Hong Kong, Germany, New Zealand, Spain, Canada and Malaysia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I employ a winemaker, a vineyard manager, a secretary/bookkeeper, a salesman and 2 vineyard/cellar hands.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are unlikely to be able to pass this impost on to our local consumers as the price elasticity of demand for wine is high.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what sort of survival is it? Our losses will increase by close to the full extent of the tax (i.e. $40,000). This is the annual cost of employing a person or the cost of our export market development activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do you suggest we do? Add another person to the million unemployed or forsake the $200,000 plus of export revenue we generate annually?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My wines have won major national and international awards.

<PARA>Whilst David Wollan's comments are directed towards the wine industry, the sentiments he expresses could just as readily be applied to many other small business enterprises in Victoria and, indeed, Australia. The winegrowers are by no means the only potential victims of this latest Labor budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the saddest and most unsatisfactory aspects of the budget is that it is the battlers, the low-income earners, the poor, the disadvantaged and the vulnerable&mdash;many of whom are farmers, pensioners and self-funded retirees&mdash;who will suffer most from the inequitable measures it contains. They are the ones who will be hardest hit by the increases in wholesale sales tax and fuel excise which will result in price rises for a wide range of basic commodities.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These increases came into effect on budget night.

It is worth noting that for every week the personal income tax cuts are delayed, the government saves itself about $50 million.

This, combined with the higher indirect taxes, will leave everyone significantly worse off. Perhaps there may be positive financial or social impact for the people of Victoria, although I must admit I cannot imagine what it could possibly be, in light of the government's decision to change the rules halfway through the game in regard to taxation of lump sum payments of unused accrued annual leave. What about those Victorians&mdash;and there are thousands of them&mdash;who are simply not able or not permitted to take their full entitlements every year?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The value of the federal budget to the people of Victoria in real terms is clear, particularly in direct contrast to the actions of the Kennett state government. The electorate of Corinella has the 11th highest proportion of people under the age of five&mdash;over 11,000 kids&mdash;of any electorate in Australia, and it also has one of the highest proportions, at 55.5 per cent, of couples who are both in the labour force. The federal budget included a child-care rebate which will greatly assist many of these young couples in my electorate. In addition, we announced a further 29,000 child-care places, sales tax exemptions for child-care centres and assistance to establish new playgroups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of further sections of the federal government's child-care policy requires the cooperation of the Kennett government, cooperation that we have received from other state governments but not from Kennett. This is not unexpected, given the Kennett government's draconian cuts to the preschool system&mdash;cuts that, according to Kindergarten Parents of Victoria, could force kindergarten fees up about 300 per cent; cuts that will see voluntary preschool committees of management, already stretched to the limit, having to find an average of an extra $16,500 per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In education, where the Kennett government is only prepared to match the average, the difference is again stark. In my electorate, the Kennett government has already closed four schools and more are set to close when the results of the ridiculously named quality provision task force process become known. This QPT process is nothing more than the Kennett government doing a Pontius Pilate, washing its hands of responsibility for education, setting staff against school councils, against parents and against other schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has not washed its hands of the young people of Australia. In those areas of the education system that the federal government has responsibility for, we are not prepared to search for educational areas showing signs of excellence, cut them down to an average and attempt to dress it all up as quality provision. The approach of the federal government to educating our young people could not be more different. In higher education&mdash;and this is an issue of concern to me because the number of young people in my electorate going to university is far too low&mdash;this year the federal government is putting in $4.6 billion. That is about twice the OECD average in terms of the contribution to higher education in a national budget. Our contribution is about 4.5 per cent, compared with Japan's 1.1 per cent of its budget provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Included in federal government initiatives are measures to ensure that more university places are available to our young people when they leave what is left of the Victorian school system. If we were to follow the principles of the Kennett government and say that averages only are good enough and it is all we are going to do, we would be cutting our expenditure in half. There would be no funds available for the new Monash University campus at Berwick which, when it is completed, will service a significant proportion of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the federal government talks about quality provision in the education sector, it does not take a Kennett style approach and close universities. Instead, we are providing $76 million to enhance quality in universities. Those areas of the education system that fall under the responsibility of the federal government are governed by policies concerned with the long-term welfare of our young people and our country, rather than a Kennett style approach of cut first and ask questions later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the people of my electorate were given the choice of cuts in education, child care and kindergartens and thousands of government employees sacked, versus no state budget deficit, I know which one they would choose. The approach of the Kennett government is not one of financial responsibility but one of uncaring political zealotry. It is not an approach of planning for a stable future, because the lack of cohesion and the social costs created by the financially punitive measures inflicted on the less well off in Victoria will more than offset any savings. While the federal government has delivered on its election promises, what the Kennett government has been doing, and continues to do, to the people in my electorate, constitutes one of the best arguments yet for putting the issue of the abolition of the states on the republican agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at other areas of the federal budget, the objective is to promote jobs through fiscal stimulus, export and industry restructuring facilitation, and strong employment education and training programs. Over 100 separate spending commitments will be implemented. The government has honoured all commitments made to farmers and resource industries, including more than doubling its previous commitment to RAS. In one of our fastest growing export areas, tourism, there will be an additional $80 million over the next four years. Initiatives are to include regional tourism development, special interest tourism marketing development and eco-tourism development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast that with the approach of the Kennett government. Twenty-three teaching positions are to be cut from the five secondary schools in the Shire of Cranbourne, which will double the number of teaching positions cut in the electorate since the Kennett government was elected. The results of the quality provision task force to be announced on 15 October are expected to include that more than 100 schools in Victoria be closed and 2,400 more teachers be sacked.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is 13.1 per cent unemployment in Victoria and this government attacks the people who are unemployed, those who are on social security benefits, because the government has opted for a mishmash of tax increases that will impact particularly hard on those who are at the bottom of the income scale. The government makes no apologies for that. Why not? It is because the misrepresentations that they made going into the federal election campaign led them to conclude that the economy was in great shape. They thought we would come roaring out of the recession, that the tax cuts that were l-a-w, law, were affordable and in place, and that we needed no further taxes to cover those tax cuts. Wrong!

One of those positive aspects resulting from the budget is the announcement that a mature age allowance will be introduced from 20 March 1994.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dunkley suggested that it is the new government in Victoria that is forcing people to go to Queensland. I would suggest that he consider the fact that those people left Victoria when it was under the governments of Mr Cain and Mrs Kirner. Putting this motion before this House just creates an opportunity for diversion, which is typical of the tactics used by the current government and the honourable members who sit on that side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me point out a few additional difficulties that the Victorian government confronts in Victoria. Victoria is the one state in this nation that suffers under the difficulty of competing with imports. It is the one state in this country that needs those costs of imports reduced. I would suggest that the honourable member for Dunkley should concentrate on the budget this federal government has put forward, rather than on condemning other governments which are trying to take constructive action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact on all Victorians of the fuel price increases will be more than the $3 per week suggested by the honourable member for Dunkley for those low income people and pensioners he mentioned. By the time that the impact of the wholesale sale tax increases on every consumer item from soap and cosmetics to food items is felt, the extra cost will be at least $5 per grocery trolley per week. Three dollars is hardly enough to compensate for those benefits that the honourable member for Dunkley put before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to suggest that the honourable member for Dunkley consider the desperate position of grape growers in my electorate. They contribute something like 50 per cent of the grape production in Victoria. They now face the prospect of a reduced demand across the whole of Australia. There is a reduced demand of 50,000 tonnes per annum of wine variety grapes, because of the massive hike in wholesale sale tax on wine. That tonnage represents the entire production of wine grapes in the Barossa Valley. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House acts urgently to respond to the recommendations in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The call for recognition </EMPHASIS>to ensure:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)an end to the discrimination against the descendants of South Sea Islanders;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)that descendants of South Sea Islanders remain proud Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>The report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on the situation of Australians who are South Sea Islanders was handed down on 15 December 1992, which was some nine months ago. My motion calls for this House&mdash;and, through it, this government&mdash;to act urgently to respond to the six recommendations that are listed in that report. Perhaps, in contrast to a history of 125 years or longer of discrimination against these people, a nine-month delay may not appear too long to some people. But it is too long; and I would hope that this House, all political parties, and the government would act without delay to end this discrimination against South Sea Islanders and their descendants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At our current state of social and economic development&mdash;and particularly with many of the Mabo claims and decisions&mdash;some Australians would believe that the most disadvantaged group in Australia are the 229,000 people of Aboriginal descent and the 27,000 people of Torres Strait Island descent. This is not the case. By far the most disadvantaged are the 15,000 to 20,000 South Sea Islander descendants of those early islanders who, from the 1860s, were blackbirded or kidnapped from their home islands of Vanuatu; the Solomons, including Guadalcanal; the Gilberts; and many others, to be indentured in the cane farming industry of Queensland and northern New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the conclusions from the report are interesting. The report said that South Sea Islanders have suffered from essentially racial discrimination and harsh treatment. In fact, the statistical profiles in the report indicate that they are one of the poorest groups in Australia. The report also says that the South Sea Islanders as a group are in a situation of high need, with particular difficulties observed in school retention rates, employment skills, home ownership and health. While material benefits have been given to South Sea Islanders, governments have denied South Sea Islanders recognition as a distinct black minority group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also says that such lack of recognition, over time, contributed to increased tensions amongst the South Sea Islanders themselves and between them and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Lastly, the South Sea Islanders are now being denied access to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs, and are being forced into mainstream programs which are seen by them to be culturally inappropriate, with the result that those programs are not used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the report notes, legally the original workers were not slaves but indentured labourers, receiving some #6 per year for a three-year contract, #18 altogether. But that slavery is more than a legal concept; it is a way of describing how two groups of people relate. As a result many South Sea Islanders during the inquiry referred to themselves as the descendants of slaves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fragments of a Lost Heritage</EMPHASIS>, Noel Fatnowna, a close and sincere friend to many, traces his heritage, in much the same way as an American descendant of a slave traced his origins back to Africa in the internationally proclaimed book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Roots</EMPHASIS>. Fatnowna traces his heritage back to his grandfather and grand-uncles at a time when they were blackbirded from Malaita. It is clear that their removal from their homeland to Australia was most involuntary. I indicate this not from an intent to build into this argument a guilt complex but to say that no other ethnic group, not even the original convicts, came to our shores with less recognition or greater discrimination than did the South Sea Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change in our constitution in 1967 to recognise the indigenous Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and the formation of ATSIC in the late 1980s compounded the discrimination; it did not relieve it. This is in stark contrast to the role South Sea Islander descendants played in the creation of the great Australian sugar industry, in decentralising Queensland to towns right along the coast, and in bringing South Sea Islander culture and heritage to Australia and maintaining it there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the last statistical count in my electorate of Dawson there are 3,224 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, yet no part of those statistics indicates the numbers of South Sea Islanders&mdash;who total, as the report notes, 3,420 in the Mackay region and 1,634 in the northern region of my electorate. As the report points out, the major discrimination is that South Sea Islanders are not included in any ATSIC programs. This means that they are not included in the benefits of the funds allocated to ATSIC. My understanding is that $1,316 million of Commonwealth funds were allocated in 1992-93 to ATSIC and other Commonwealth programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Yet, as the report indicates, in health, education, housing and community services, South Sea Islanders suffer the same disadvantages as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders but have access to none of those funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Sea Islander home ownership rates are lower than those of any other racial group in Australia. As evidence, in Mackay, South Sea Islanders who were previously in the Aboriginal housing society are being severely discouraged from the ownership and renting of cooperative housing and are being expelled from the membership. There is obviously a discrimination that is not being redressed by the state housing authorities, yet $327 million has been allocated through ATSIC in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the health area the report suggests that the South Sea Islanders suffer a relatively high incidence of diabetes and that they die younger than Australians overall. Again, $67 million provided to ATSIC is not available to South Sea Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note a survey in the report of 39 South Sea Islander schools by a Mr Simon Bliss concludes that, in education:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Islander students continue to experience difficulties in language skills and mathematics;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">they do not have their right to an appropriate education secured in government policy;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">very few services exist to support Islander students' educational difficulties;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Sea Islanders are a minority group in education;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Islander students experience considerably higher rates of difficulties in education than their non-Islander peers;</PARA>
<PARA>Again I mention that $295 million has been specially allocated to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, yet these people with greatest difficulties have access to none of that. The unemployment rate for South Sea Islanders is 28.5 per cent, 2.5 times the national average. This reflects a system that does not deliver adequate education, health, housing or opportunity for income earning to the South Sea Islanders themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to dwell too long on report statistics. Sometimes they can be a bit loaded one way or the other and sometimes the findings are not accurate. Nor do I want to dwell too much on the negative aspects of this discrimination, except to say the report itself is well worth reading for its coverage of the proud history of the South Sea Islanders in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to place on record the contributions that these descendants of the South Sea Islanders are making as Australians to Australian culture, the economy, sport and many other areas. I pay tribute to all the South Sea Islanders who contribute in all these ways to the economy of Queensland and Australia and to the social and community fabric of their own electorate. I particularly mention those people who have formed the Australian South Sea Islanders United Council Inc. In particular, I thank Patricia Corowa and two people from my own electorate, Colin Andrew and Christine Andrew, brother and sister, who are making sure that the rights of the people are being pushed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke previously of Noel Fatnowna, a most respected member of the Mackay community and an islander descendant himself. He was the author of the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fragments of a Lost Heritage</EMPHASIS>. Again, I suggest that, for anybody who wants to know what happened in those earlier days and what is still happening, this should be compulsory reading. He contributed positively to Australian culture. Unfortunately, Noel died in 1991 and through that we lost a great Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three South Sea Islanders&mdash;Francis Fewquandie, Norman Womal and Noel Howard&mdash;gave their lives in the Vietnam War while many other of these descendants fought in World War II and Vietnam. Probably the proudest is Mal Meninga, who captains the Australian Kangaroos. I identify him as one of the truly great sportsmen in Australia today. Henry Tongoa, in 1901, set up the first Pacific islander association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, South Sea Islanders play an integral part in our Christian churches and, through that, in our society. They have retained their dignity, their heritage and traditions. They are good and proper Australians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The master hurried them down a plank onto the timber which appeared to be floating on the water. The men who had been standing and looking at them now began to grab and push them towards huge brown and black animals that were tied to flat pieces of timber. Skinny short sticks with thick hard brown vines attached, were used to prod Wacvie and his fellows up onto the flat timber, behind the big animals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The men were shackled with irons, and their legs, not having touched land for many weeks, were unsteady. Some felt as though their feet would snap from their ankles, and some felt they could not walk at all. The horse-drawn drays were difficult to climb onto because each man had to lift himself up with his hands and then drag his feet up by his body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Side by side they sat, each leaning against his neighbour to give physical support to each other. When all the drays were loaded with the black men, they were drawn into a line facing the unmade road.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After strolling around the drays many times, they gathered together in groups to discuss the condition of the slaves.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose we could think that that might be a quote from a novel written about the Deep South in America, about slavery in that country; but it is not. It is a quote from a novel by Faith Bandler about her father. Faith Bandler is a well-known writer in Australia and a descendent of a South Pacific Islander, Wacvie Mussingkon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a story about Faith's father, Wacvie Mussingkon, who in June 1883 was kidnapped from Craig Cove, a village on the coast of Ambrym Island in the New Hebrides. He was sold as a slave in Mackay, Queensland, and that is where the quote comes from. He worked in the sugar plantations until he escaped in 1897, finally settling in Tumbulgum in New South Wales where he died in July 1924. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not often that we have the opportunity in this House to speak on a bipartisan motion like this one. I commend the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) for putting this motion before the House and drawing to the House's attention the human rights report. There is a call for recognition of the South Sea Islander people, who, unlike a lot of other people in Australia, were not migrants who came to this country of their own choice. They were brought here under slave conditions. When that particular period of our history finished, they were then forced to go back to their homeland and were not necessarily taken back to their own particular island. I commend the honourable member for Dawson for drawing this issue to the attention of the House and I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to speak on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When some time ago I read the book by Faith Bandler about her father, I was particularly moved. I had seen Faith Bandler on a TV show one night speaking about the plight of the South Pacific Island people in Australia and I got her book out to read about her father. It sat there for some time before I got the opportunity to read it. Earlier this year I had the opportunity to visit a number of South Pacific islands and I took this book with me. After visiting some of those islands, I read this book on the way home. It takes a long time to get home from some of those islands, so I had plenty of time on the plane. It was a fitting time to read it, when we think about how these people have been treated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission tabled in this House on 6 May, which the honourable member for Dawson has referred to, marks an important milestone in the fight for the recognition of the rights of South Sea Islander people in Australia. The report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The call for recognition</EMPHASIS>, is a stinging indictment of the century of discrimination and injustices suffered by these proud people. The vast majority of these people are descended from the Melanesian group and were brought to Queensland to work in the sugar industry during the latter part of the 19th century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has been proud of its record of recognising the unique place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australian society. Of course, that is a very important topic at the present time as we consider the Mabo legislation. We have put in place a range of programs in areas such as health, community welfare and employment in an attempt to recognise the special needs of these people. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has also been established in order to give these people more power over their own lives and their destiny as a people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we still have a long way to go before Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders gain their rightful place in Australian society, at least the problems of indigenous people have been recognised and the need for action has been broadly accepted by the community. Sadly, the same cannot be said for the plight of the South Sea Islander people. The report of the human rights commission sums up their history by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The South Sea Islander history over the past century indicates that their general treatment was as close to slavery as the laws of the time would allow. White Society used them as labourers when needed and discarded them when no longer needed: they were coerced and expendable labour.</PARA>
<PARA>South Sea Islanders today suffer discrimination and the social problems that go with it similar to those that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people experience, but unfortunately there are few programs which are targeted at addressing this discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the results of a census of South Sea Islanders conducted last year, they are 2 1/2 times as likely to be unemployed as other Australians, have average weekly earnings at half the national level and have the lowest rate of home ownership of any group in this country. Yet the only way in which these people can access government assistance is by denying their heritage and claiming to be Aborigines or Torres Strait Islander people. No group should be forced to deny its heritage in this way, and I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Dawson. Not only does it force them to live a lie; it also creates tensions between them and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, which are certainly not needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many South Sea Islanders are being denied access to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs, meaning that even this avenue of financial assistance has been cut off to them. It is essential that South Sea Islanders receive rightful recognition as a unique minority group that has suffered as a result of racial discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the report before us needs urgent attention by the government and I hope that the government will pick up the points that have been made here today by the honourable member for Dawson and other speakers to this motion. To highlight the great tragedy and our shame I quote again from the foreword of Faith Bandler's book, where she talked about her father:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wacvie Mussingkon was an islander of the group which white men call the New Hebrides. He grew to manhood in the gentle rhythms of an island village. He swam, caught fish, played in the trees, joined in the mourning for the dead and knew the coming of islanders with gifts for the dancing ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this life ended in the few moments that it takes to shackle a man. He was taken by blackbirders to the sugar plantations of Queensland. Colonial Australia had developed its very own slave trade to secure cheap labour for the canefields, and Wacvie was a victim of this crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His days become governed by the clock instead of the sun. Unable to understand what was happening to them, he and his fellow islanders suffered the cruelty of overseers, meagre food, bug-infested quarters, and gruelling days of labour under the tropical sun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Wacvie never lost his sense of human dignity. He had to fight against despair, bewilderment, and apathy, but for his fellow-captives he became the symbol of all that they had lost and all that they might hope for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His struggle to gain control over the pattern of his life, so cruelly distorted by captivity in an alien land, is the continuing thread of this book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wacvie Mussingkon was the father of Faith Bandler, the author. He told his story to her and she has written it into this biographical novel.

It is a very important motion not only to South Sea Islander Australians but also, I believe, to the whole of the Australian community. The 20,000 descendants of the South Sea Islanders living in Australia are really the forgotten people of Australia. It is interesting that some 8 per cent of that population is living on the north coast of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering any aspect of what we do in this place and in the politics of Australia, I always prefer to believe very strongly that the `P' in politics stands for people. If we are not concerned about people, what on earth are we doing here? I am reminded of this when I think of a gentleman that the honourable member for Dawson mentioned, the late Noel Fatnowna. To my mind, he epitomises everything that was great and good in the South Sea Island people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was privileged to first meet Noel Fatnowna in Mackay in 1977. I recall very vividly that my wife and I were to meet him in a milk bar/coffee shop. We were supposed to be there for about half an hour; some four hours later we were still there. He was drinking milkshakes; we were drinking coffee. The conversation was flowing like a great rushing torrent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Noel Fatnowna was, I believe, a marvellous man. He was widely respected throughout North Queensland. I am speaking about him because, for me, he epitomises the contribution that has already been made by South Sea Island people and will continue to be made. He was remembered particularly for his services in Mackay as a caring and dedicated ambulance officer for over 40 years. He was a familiar figure throughout the whole community. He provided an enormous amount of leadership for the Islander community most importantly towards good community relations, better housing and better health. He went out of his way to speak to school students about the common citizenship of all Australians. He was a very visionary person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a peacemaker and he had this enormous capacity to put other people's worries ahead of his own. I think it was very significant that he was invited to represent the Kanakas on the Queensland Aboriginal and Islanders Commission. I use the term `Kanakas' deliberately because it is not a pejorative one: it is a word that means `man of the islands' and it is a word that all South Sea Islanders or Kanakas can use with pride. This was the very first time that the Australian South Sea Islanders or Kanakas had ever been represented formally on anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall very well indeed the four-hour initial meeting with him. I preface my next comment by saying that his skin colour was very dark&mdash;he was indeed black&mdash;and he had an enormous and wonderful sense of humour. I recall him saying to me during that meeting, `It is hard to be an ambulance officer at an accident after dark. Unless I smile at the patients they will not see me'. That is an indication of the sort of man Noel was and an indication of the sort of people these wonderful South Sea Island people are. Some 60,000 were brought here from the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and Papua New Guinea between 1863 and 1904. They were used to plug the shortage of labour at the end of convict transportation. By 1906, in spite of having provided the backbone of the Australian sugar industry, they were no longer welcome in this country because of the White Australia Policy but, fortunately, we have changed mightily since that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say to the people of Australia and to the honourable members of this parliament that the recommendations of the report on the situation of Australian South Sea Islanders should be implemented by the government.

Labor governments and the predecessors of the present coalition have all had a disgraceful record, going back to the last century, in relation to what was basically slave labour. I have to say, as a proud trade unionist in this parliament, that the trade union movement also should stand condemned for its reaction historically to South Sea Island people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have to look to the future now, and I congratulate the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) on bringing this matter before the House. South Sea Island people constitute a considerable part of his electorate but, as previous speakers have said, there are South Sea Island people throughout the Australian community, including in my electorate at Cairns, Innisfail and Port Douglas. The most northern part of my electorate is probably the most multicultural part of Australia. A lot of South Sea Island people who came to the Torres Strait area are obviously distant relatives of the people further south. Obviously, as the member for Leichhardt, I support this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that there are between 15,000 and 20,000 descendants of South Sea Islanders in Australia and 12,000 of them identify themselves as South Sea Islanders. They include&mdash;I think quite proudly&mdash;the current captain of the Australian Kangaroos, Mr Mal Meninga. His achievements and his quite proud statement that he is a South Sea Islander are obviously very significant. The report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission says that the South Sea Islanders are clearly one of the most disadvantaged groups in our society. Their unemployment rate is 28.5 per cent and their youth unemployment is about 50 per cent. The average weekly earnings of these people is $270 compared to the Australian average of $504. They have the lowest level of home ownership in Australia, apart from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people, so very clearly they are a disadvantaged group. </PARA>

In 1977 the report of the royal commission into human relationships made similar recommendations, at least with regard to the benefits paid to South Sea Islanders. Unfortunately, the government of that time did not act. I join with all honourable members who are supporting this motion to call on the government to act now. When one looks at that report and takes into account what I have just said about the disadvantage, the most important recommendation of the report is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Islanders should be identified as a high-need group in equal opportunity, access and equity programs, and they should be employed in government agencies dealing directly with the South Sea Islander community, most particularly in the Department of Social Security, the CES, and Housing Department offices in Queensland and Northern New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that this is the most important thing that we can do and something that we can do immediately. As the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) will know, the committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs is looking at the effectiveness of the government's program for access and equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. Although this would certainly be outside our terms of reference, clearly there is a need for access and equity for South Sea Island people. That is shown by the statistics that I referred to earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rest of the government's response is going to be a little more complex. The access and equity matter is one that can be handled very quickly. Extending further benefits would require budget allocations. I am not saying that this should not be done&mdash;I would support that&mdash;but that is something that cannot be done next week. I would certainly support the motion that is before the House that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission be supported, and I commend the motion to honourable members. </PARA>

Like him, I resigned from the front bench in a government, and the Parliamentary Library told me it was without precedent that a person stood down voluntarily from a cabinet without going for a superior position. Of course, I did it after I had been a minister for six years so it did not matter very much to me, but to him it was a very great sacrifice. I am told by the library that it was without precedent in Australian parliamentary history.

So I do not hesitate to embarrass him by making a substantial comment about him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been references earlier to blackbirding, and I would like to give honourable members an idea of what we are talking about here. I quote from what I have here:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1863 the infamous blackbirder, Ross Lewin, started the trade proper with the kidnapping of 67 men on the schooner <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Black Dog</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>That was a very apt name in view of the way these people were treated. If anyone here has any doubts about the slave status of these helpless individuals, Lewin advertised these 67 proud men as being for sale at #7 each. How cheap was a human life in those days!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To hide this dreadful trade in human lives behind the often misunderstood term of blackbirding belies some of the terrible stories that are today well documented. Those stories include those such as the horror that occurred on the brig <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Carl</EMPHASIS> on the night of 17 September 1871 when the part owner and captain of the vessel, one Dr James Patrick Murray of Melbourne, and his crew shot some 80 natives that they had kidnapped from the Buka Passage in the northern Solomons when they tried to break out. These men, some only wounded, were thrown overboard to drown or be taken alive by sharks. The estimable Dr Murray got off scot-free when he turned queen's evidence. Even though the state government of Queensland tried to legislate against the forceful removal of Pacific Island natives, only one charge of slave trading was ever laid in the sad history of blackbirding&mdash;and that case failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of discussion about that outstanding and ingratiating personality, Noel Fatnowna. It was hard for anyone to come in contact with Noel without remembering him. I found his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fragments of a Lost Heritage</EMPHASIS> very moving. In fact, I read it in almost one sitting. It was very engrossing&mdash;a small version, if you like, of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Roots</EMPHASIS>, telling who he was, where he came from and what his forebears had suffered and achieved. When they came out to Australia&mdash;and, in a lot of cases, it is fair to say that there was genuine indentured labour&mdash;a lot of these people, like many of our own forebears, came out because they wanted something better for their kids, or maybe there was a bit of romance and excitement attached to it as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they arrived, things were pretty grim but they got an awful lot grimmer when the trade union movement&mdash;and I am not criticising the rising power of the trade union movement; at the time, they did a good job for our country&mdash;unfortunately interspersed with its drive to achieve the rights and privileges which they had every right to fight to achieve&mdash;an element of flagrant racism. A cursory reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Worker</EMPHASIS>, as it was called, a newspaper in Queensland and the organ of the Australian Workers Union, would indicate the breadth and depth of feeling against people of South Sea Island descent in the state of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The laws that they passed&mdash;and they were probably good laws overall&mdash;had a dreadful effect upon the people of South Sea Islander descent. They went through a period of 20 or 30 years when they had little ability to stay alive. I think in Noel's book, or it may have been in another journal that I read, it said that `Staying alive time' lasted for a period of 20 or 30 years. They lived simply in the bush and off the kindness and generosity of a lot of white people who lived in the neighbouring towns who took them under their wing. They were able to stay alive and get jobs when times got better and became eventually an integral part of the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also congratulate the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) for introducing this motion. I think it is very worth while to be involved with honourable members on the opposite side in an area of commonality. The motion itself has to be seen in the context of a fairly novel interest in this matter over the last few years. The report we speak about was preceded in 1991 by the Evatt Foundation's publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian South Sea Islanders: A Report on the Current Status of South Sea Islanders in Australia</EMPHASIS>. There is, for instance, in Sydney at the present time a display at the Powerhouse Museum of photographs contributed by Kerry Packer's Australian Consolidated Press which, whilst featuring the broader islander situation, touches upon this subject also.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that when we speak to this motion today we understand that we should guard against this being another false dawn. As an earlier speaker commented, in 1977 there was a royal commission into human relationships and it made a number of points. It stated then that these people `are discriminated against' and that they `suffer from many of the disadvantages which affect Aboriginals'. That royal commission also determined that these people suffer unjustified hardship because of this exclusion from benefits stemming from the 1967 referendum and that action should be taken to extend to them eligibility for benefits now available to Aboriginals. So 16 years ago there were those kinds of suggestions around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular submission goes very deeply into the very real hardships experienced by the people. I think a number of those South Sea Islanders would feel a degree of irony that people such as Faith Bandler were involved in the 1967 referendum which, for the first time, drove home to the Australian population and political structures the need to take positive discrimination in favour of Aboriginals. But, at the same time, what eventually happened was that in some cases South Sea Islanders were denied benefits because of this new emphasis on the needs of Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen in this document is a clear delineation of massive problems in the community. Unemployment is at 28.5 per cent, 2 1/2 times the level of the Australian population. And as other speakers have indicated, they have the lowest level of home ownership in the country. But what strikes me in this particular report and other documents is their education situation, their level of tertiary education admission. The fact that they do not get something like Abstudy has made them into a community that is lacking in qualifications and one that is left out of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As earlier speakers have said, the position of both political parties in this matter has been very disconcerting. We had a situation where these people in many cases were forcibly brought to this country. They were housed in very unsatisfactory conditions. In 1868 measures were taken to bring in an inspectorate into their conditions, but even in that very year people were prepared to give up their wages if it meant not going back to the plantations. However, they were forcibly put back there by the Queensland legal system despite evidence of floggings, unsatisfactory food and accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we saw through the later part of the 19th century, as earlier speakers have indicated, was that the trade union movement, very concerned with the reality that in some cases these people were undermining the wage structure&mdash;they were only here because they were cheap labour, they were not here out of friendship&mdash;instituted a situation to alter those laws. Over the next few decades we had restrictive clauses in awards saying that people of non-European descent could not work on farms over a certain size. There were actually bounties so that sugar produced by Europeans was favoured over any that was produced by South Sea Islanders. We had, from about 1906, forced deportation from this country, with a few minor exclusions such as that those who had lived here for 20 years or were married were allowed to remain. I once again congratulate the honourable member for Dawson in having the initiative to bring this motion before the House. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a party slogan of the ruling party of Oceania in George Orwell's novel <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">1984</EMPHASIS>, and was used as a justification for the alteration of history to engineer the present and the future. The second is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the man who was Prime Minister for 17 years, during which Australia was united, steadily governed, and could offer a job to any man or woman who wanted one&mdash;Menzies is presented as a failure because he could not `read the direction of the river of life'.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from Peter Ryan in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> magazine in September this year and is an indication of Ryan's view of Manning Clark's view of the Menzies era. As the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has commented, the view that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has of Australian history is a comic book version of Manning Clark's view, which itself was heavily criticised in Peter Ryan's work in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> magazine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attack by the Prime Minister on Australia's longest serving Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, has also represented a crude attempt to mock the history of this nation. His constant character assaults and assassinations are galling to Australians who have used Sir Robert as a builder of national identity and a linchpin of good economic policies, under which employment opportunities boomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Robert was at the helm of a golden age and, when contrasted to the tough times now faced by Australians as a legacy of 10 years of Labor government, that golden age makes a mockery of the present Prime Minister and his own government's abysmal performance. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford History of Australia</EMPHASIS> made the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir Robert Menzies remained . . . the only Australian Prime Minister since the First World War to retire at a time of his own choosing. This is a mark both of his political skill and the disarray of his Labor opponents, but more than either it reflects the economic buoyancy of the 1950s and 1960s when political changes came seldom . . . In political and economic terms Australia was a model of stability in a fast-changing world. To the extent that the Menzies government presented a reassuring image of resolute anti-communism and fidelity to great and powerful allies, it could claim credit for creating an attractive environment for large scale investors of overseas capital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same publication observed that, upon the retirement of Menzies in 1966, most Australians considered themselves significantly better off than they had been in a long time. Their average weekly earnings had increased by four per cent in real terms, representing roughly five times the rate of advance of living standards between 1901 and 1940. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment stood at 1.2 per cent in 1950, lower than at any other period in Australian history, and it compared favourably to Britain and the United States. In 1965 unemployment in Australia was still steady at 1.2 per cent and it climbed no higher than 3.2 per cent in late 1961 and early 1962. It is clearly wrong of the Prime Minister to attack that record when he can do nothing to free this country of 11 per cent unemployment and the worst statistic of 32 per cent youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good fortune of this country continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s due to constantly expanding world trade, a stable international monetary system and vigorous export growth. Even then, the importance of trade with the South-East Asian region was recognised. The quest for new export markets dominated our nation's trade policies in the 1950s and 1960s, included the probing for new trade markets in south and east Asia, China and Japan. These trading relations were unhindered by our ties with the British monarchy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it odd that, when the Prime Minister can admit that Menzies understood the power that a common national sentiment commands, he can also refer to Menzies' ideology as being sterile, and say that Menzies was not aggressively Australian nor aggressively proud of our culture. That, as the Prime Minister should well know, is a fallacy. Sir Robert Menzies' leadership was a way of life for Australians. He was accepted as a father figure and a living symbol of authority; unlike our present Prime Minister, whose divide and conquer, chop and change approach has earned him little respect amongst ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Menzies respected the valuable institutions and influences of our British heritage: the law, parliament, the great works of the English language, liberty and individualism. He was a fierce and effective advocate for Australia. Menzies was not a fawner or a flatterer. His relationship with Churchill was one of admiration, but Menzies did not hesitate to clash with him as he sat in the British war cabinet. His love and respect for the monarch were sincere, but he said of the royal family in the late 1930s, `These royal sons are all triers, but they have a late flowering'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister was overwhelmed by his visit to Ireland this month. He is trying to portray his excursion and his family's Irish heritage as justification for outrageous and divisive sectarian comments about the relationship between Catholics and the Australian system of constitutional government. This should be contrasted with Menzies' 1940 journey to Ireland to act as an honest broker with De Valera in Dublin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister boasts about his role in developing a greater interest in Asia. It seems shallow when, as far back as 1936, Menzies was concerned about the effect of trade arrangements between British textile interests and Australia, and the effect that might have on our trade with Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and others make much of Menzies' anti-communist scaremongering, and yet the Prime Minister cynically used scaremongering in the recent election campaign, even though he had supported many of the measures contained in the coalition's Fightback program. In other words, his actions were hypocritical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could hardly argue, in contrast, that Menzies was anything but sincere in his detestation of communism, whose supporters and propagators in the union movement had even obstructed Australia's war effort in the Second World War until the Soviet Union was invaded by Germany and became an ally. Menzies has been proven to be right in his view that communism was a conspiracy against constitutional government and was committed to bringing about revolution. After the fall of the Soviet communist government, what has become known about the activities of the KGB and its huge array of client organisations, including Australian ones, has revealed the extent to which Stalin and his successors would use fellow travellers to suit the ends of constructing a huge empire that relied on terror, torture and repression for its maintenance of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Menzies saw the strength of democracy as being based on individuals making reasoned choices as to what was best for the country. He implemented policies to ensure that all those who had ability, regardless of economic background, could receive the best education the country could offer. `Elitist!' is the cry of honourable members opposite. However, that should be contrasted with the decline of our education standards, often in the name of political correctness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Menzies' desire to encourage excellence should be contrasted with the elitism of those on the left who dominate much of academia and who, in some cases, are so intellectually cowardly that they are unable to question or criticise those of their colleagues who abdicate their responsibilities to be honest and scholarly in their work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Menzies stood for the forgotten people, the middle class, who in Australia were largely unrepresented, having neither the power of organised labour nor the clout of wealth and influence. This should be contrasted with the sordid relationship between the Prime Minister and his mates in big business and the unions, to the extent that the so-called Kirribilli affair&mdash;a sleazy political deal to hand over the highest office in the land&mdash;was brokered by a magnate and a union boss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kim Beazley senior made the wry comment that, when as a young man he went to ALP forums, those present were the cream of the working class, while now those there, in many cases, represented the dregs of the middle class. Peter Walsh, in decrying the influence of a sinecured Balmain basketweaver class over ALP policy, asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would Chifley have allowed the long-footed potoroo&mdash;or whatever fad was in vogue with the chattering classes&mdash;to take priority over one million unemployed?</PARA>
<PARA>This should be contrasted with the words of Menzies, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measurement and estimation of economic trends, the organisation of finance, the devising of plans for social security, the discovery of what to do. We have neglected it as an art, the delineating and practice of how and when to do these things and above all, how to persuade a self-governing people to accept and loyally observe them.</PARA>
<PARA>Is this the slavish voice of an abject fawner? Of course not. He was a proud and determined Australian leader whose latter-day successes in the Labor Party have sold out Australia's sovereignty through amassing a huge national debt and signing away Australia's self-determination in endless international covenants and agreements that serve to reduce Australia's capacity to make independent decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thanks to 10 long years of `hard labor' the people of this nation are rapidly losing hope about the security of their own economic futures. The inability of many families to cope with the recession and diminishing household budgets has placed an unnecessary strain on the family structure with the instances of separation, divorce and even child abuse escalating as a result of rising tensions and the loss of economic certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is doing nothing to offer people hope or security, and the anti-social behaviour which is becoming more evident in our community is testimony to the fact that people feel powerless and alienated and that they will continue to do so, republic or no republic, new flag or old.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are generations of people who grew up under Menzies, whose parents had jobs and made the best of what they had.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Menzies years were the lost years, unlike what we have heard from the honourable member for Moore. They were the years of slumber and a legacy of lost opportunities. The honourable member for Moore alluded to Judith Brett of La Trobe University. She is the author of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Robert Menzies' Forgotten People</EMPHASIS> and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current liberal party is most deluded by this belief that the political stability of the fifties was a positive achievement, as it strives to regain Menzies' political success by reviving his political symbols. What it fails to see is that the effectiveness of these symbols was being undermined by social changes, even when they appeared to have achieved their greatest success. Politics lagged behind social change then, and the party seems determined it will continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA>It is deplorable that the opposition's understanding of economics is so deficient that it mistook stagnation for stability. The Menzies' idea of economic policy was to sit back and do the bidding of Britain&mdash;a Britain which was already in 1961 turning its back on Australia and applying for membership to the EEC: the first of three applications before it was successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Menzies' eyes were riveted on the fading glory of empire, canny politicians such as McEwen were turning to Asia. In 1966, while Menzies was still floating the British myth at the end of his reign, Japan quite appropriately overtook Britain as our largest trading partner. Menzies still hankered for a pre-war British society that no longer existed, even in Britain. The British had decided that they knew where their future lay. McEwen had an inkling of where Australia's future lay, but Robert Gordon Menzies relied upon those imperial dreams which he was never going to have come to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His view on Australia's physical place in the world was that it was not just inconvenient for travelling to the cricket, but also frightening and dangerous. So much so that, according to the cabinet documents&mdash;unlike the gloss that has been put on this by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing)&mdash;Menzies and the 1961 cabinet, rather than going out to Asia and looking at it as a place with which Australia should co-exist, considered nuking China and North Vietnam&mdash;a nice, friendly little gesture to the region of the world that we lived in! Obviously, at his sycophantic best, Menzies' explanation would have been that he had done it at the behest of great and powerful friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the end of Menzies' reign, we were in a position where we were going to nuke our neighbours in order to still live on the coat-tails of Britain. Instead of looking at how to develop Australia and how to develop our economy, Menzies presided over an economy in 1966 where manufacturing&mdash;that is, the value added part of industry&mdash;represented less than 20 per cent of our total exports. The economies of the world were booming but, unfortunately, this Liberal hero saw no value in manufacturing, despite the excellent position that Australia was in after World War II to develop value added industries. In the eyes of Menzies and the Liberal Party of the day, if it could not be ripped up and shipped out, then forget about it. Menzies' legacy, which we are still trying to overcome, was that we missed the value added boat. Under the Keating government, we have been able to lift business expenditure in research and development, in an attempt to improve the value added part of our economy, to such an extent that today it is a record high, both in real terms and in dollar terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the standard of living of people in those days, and the standard of education of our community, compared with what it is today? In 1964, inflation and interest rates were about what they are today but, on the Holden car index in 1964, it took a worker 45 weeks pay to buy a standard Holden sedan. Today it only takes 40 weeks pay to buy a Holden Commodore. In 1964, the year my sister left high school, less than one per cent of Australians were in higher education. In line with Menzies' very British thinking, the class bias was in there with a vengeance. You did not get to go to Sydney University unless you came from the North Shore of Sydney.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am moved to speak to this motion by the ongoing, quite deliberate and totally unacceptable rewriting of history by our Prime Minister (Mr Keating). To express the outrageous actions of the Prime Minister more succinctly, I can think of no other example than the recent discussion I had with a very dear friend of mine. This honourable lady is more Irish than the Prime Minister, for she was actually born there and her family, both directly and indirectly, fought hard and long for the independence of her Ireland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She proudly migrated to Australia under Calwell's White Australia Policy in the 1950s and now calls it home. She brought with her her young family. She chose to come to Australia for she believed it would be the best place to bring up her young family and would provide them with a lifestyle and future which she found impossible to achieve in her Ireland. She rightly believed that Australia could reward her family in return for hard work and she was proven correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia she came to&mdash;the Menzies 1950s&mdash;with its full employment, its low inflation, its low interest rates and secure social framework, was unique in the world of that era. Australia was prosperous, unlike now with debt out of control. This woman is staunchly Catholic, more so than the Prime Minister because she practises her Christianity every day and her siblings have traversed the world passing on the word of God&mdash;unlike the Prime Minister, who constantly uses unchristian verbal violence against those who have the temerity to disagree with his view, on this side but more so on that side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She has chosen to train her family in Christian ways and encourage them to fulfil their dreams, which Australia could provide and has provided. But how things have changed. My dear friend did not have a supporting parent's benefit, but was able to provide tertiary education for her five children&mdash;all of whom are now contributing to the community in civic service, be it in medicine or education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She had a vision and she climbed her mountain. She now fears not so much for her children but more so for her grandchildren&mdash;those grandchildren who cannot get jobs, or who cannot get into university or even into the local preschool. She is concerned about the values of her community, which is more reliant on government welfare rather looking to reach for self-help and climb its own mountain. She worries about the increasing crime, the unemployment and ongoing division within the community, promoted by her Prime Minister. She thinks the Prime Minister of her adopted country should maintain a statesman stature but believes this is beyond him because he has betrayed the very people he thinks he represents. During the Prime Minister's recent visit to England and Ireland, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Who does this person think he is . . . what right has he to tell the world that we want to be a republic when we the people have not voted on it.</PARA>
<PARA>How profound&mdash;the people have not yet voted on it! What a shame our Prime Minister cannot quite grasp this concept&mdash;the concept of democracy&mdash;but then again that is fairly typical of an insensitive, totalitarian toff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our history is rich with achievements. Who can forget the achievements of the disgraced Jack Lang, the mentor of our Prime Minister? Lang had his own government sacked, wreaked havoc on the social policies of the Labor Party, and bagged comprehensively the light on the hill for the true believers, Ben Chifley. Lang hated Chifley for his politics, his vision, his gentleness and his greatness in Australian history, and so too does our Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who does the Prime Minister think he is to rewrite Australian history? He is a student of one of the worst politicians in Australia's history and a denigrator of all things Australian. The Prime Minister, for instance, wears Italian suits, collects French clocks, has a Paris option and calls Ireland home. Just who is this miserable example of Australian manhood, this wrecker of Australian values, to tell Australians who have helped build this great country what they want? If he were not the jackal of our history he would call the Australian people to express their point of view on the republic at the ballot box right now.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the unfortunate experience earlier in the week of witnessing the coalition frontbench&mdash;all the Queen's men&mdash;dancing and frothing at the mere mention of an Australian republic. When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) referred to the opposition frontbench members as a `motley bunch of lickspittles and fawning sycophants', I thought he was being a bit hard on them but, after seeing them earlier in the week, I now think he was being really charitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the elements of this motion is that the Prime Minister has rewritten history. Many who fought and died in the theatres of war in Asia agree wholeheartedly with the Prime Minister's interpretation of some events which occurred there. I have a constituent who spent 3 1/2 years, which included his 21st birthday, working on the Burma railway, and his interpretation of the events relating to the fall of Singapore are very much in line with the interpretation that the Prime Minister has given to that event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element of the motion deals with the Menzies years. The honourable member for Moore is quite entitled to the view that he takes on those years, but it is not one that is shared on this side of the House. However, I wonder what Menzies would say about those who succeeded him in the Liberal Party who had control of the Australian Treasury for some seven years during the Fraser years. The economic legacy of those years is quite amazing. The inflation rate was double digit; growth was negative; interest rates were around 10 per cent; the unemployment rate was around 10 per cent; industrial disputation was the highest on record; and we had an inappropriate industrial structure hopelessly suited to taking on the challenges of the 1980s and the 1990s and taking us through to the 21st century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder what Menzies would have said about the architects of the disaster that we inherited in 1983, Hewson and Howard, because they sit in the engine room of Liberal Party economic policy and they still drive it. The sooner the honourable member for Moore and the honourable member for Cowan do the Liberal Party a favour and do in their leader, get on the front bench themselves and put a little sense into the coalition's economic policy, the sooner the affairs of the nation will move forward to meet the new challenges that this nation faces, rather than backwards down the time tunnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have found the third element of this motion rather disturbing. The Prime Minister is a warm, friendly man. He is a family man. He certainly brings to the parliament a degree of colourful language in explaining situations and perhaps putting honourable members opposite in their rightful place. Be that as it may, I think there are people in the community who share the Prime Minister's vision for this country, who certainly share his concern for the unemployed in this country and who certainly support the fact that the government has set an economic framework here that will take us forward and not take us backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was one other point that I wanted to make but, as my time is nearly up, I will conclude my remarks. Time has certainly passed even the younger members of the opposition by. If they are continually going to hark back to the good old days of the Menzies era and get that warm inner feeling, I am quite happy for them to languish on the back bench for another decade. We will continue to progress the affairs of the nation along with the Prime Minister and we will share his vision, an Australian vision. It is very important to understand that his vision is a vision for Australia and for Australians. We do not hearken to anybody else in this world. We do not look backwards; we look forwards. This is an Australian vision for Australians and it is a cause of some regret that honourable member on the other side of the House do not share it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

They see a bygone golden era that is frustratingly out of reach. Their response is to vindictively vandalise the parliamentary process and learn nothing from experience, as Senator Vanstone has suggested in today's press.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Menzies era can be viewed as a saga of wasted opportunities. Australia's economic development was founded on a postwar boom. There was expanding world trade, especially in those commodities which Australia was able to provide. The history of the Menzies era is one of boom and bust with the imposition of tariff restrictions to deal with rampant inflation and protect a manufacturing sector that was geared largely to domestic demand. The tariff obsession of Black Jack McEwen, against the advice of his own Tariff Board, ultimately led to problems in our manufacturing sector that it took Labor administrations to redress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following a near defeat in 1961 Menzies commissioned the Vernon report and then ignored its recommendations in 1965. This allowed him to make economic decisions for short-term political advantage rather than make decisions in the long-term economic interest of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite Australia's relative economic prosperity, Liberal administrations spent increasingly less on social security as a proportion of GDP than the United States of America, the United Kingdom or New Zealand. Australia lost an opportunity to be a leader in information technology because Menzies saw no future in computing, despite the fact that the CSIRO built one of the first computers in the world in 1947. The cost to Australia in the importation of computing hardware continues to add to our deficit. I contend that much of Australia's economic policy during the Menzies era was grounded in Menzies' obsession with Imperial England. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Maralinga atomic test debacle was unilaterally decided by Menzies, who assured his colleagues that it would involve `no conceivable injury to life, limb or property', but it resulted in no scientific value to Australia. Similarly, the Blue Streak project absorbed huge resources because, as one of his ministers said, `What we are about to do is vital to the United Kingdom government and indeed the free world'. When the British government abandoned the project it almost forgot to tell the Menzies government. Such was its attitude towards the colonies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the policy focus of the Menzies administration can be traced to the psychological history of its protagonist. Judith Brett's analysis is instructive. I will quote from her book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Menzies Forgotten People</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Menzies idealised England far beyond and far longer than most Australians of his day; from the point of later generations he idealised it to the point of parody, even wanting in the 1960s to name the major unit of Australia's new decimal currency the Royal . . . Menzies idealisation of England was in part a defence against envy and rage he felt against something which made him feel small.</PARA>
<PARA>Brett described it as the `narcissistic wound of colonial birth'. His continued sycophantic allegiance to Imperial Britain became linked to our adherence to American foreign policy and the Vietnam debacle. It deferred Australia's assumption of true independence until the election of the Whitlam government in 1972. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is once again leading Australia with a true vision of independence. The journey towards a republic and the effect of integration into the Asia-Pacific region will bring with it economic benefits by dragging this country away from the complacency and conservatism of the Menzies era and successive conservative governments, all of which failed to grasp the essential elements of this country's future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Corio asked what Menzies thought of his successors. Menzies described his successors in an interview which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> in his retirement. He described them as `a contemptible little squirt', `a conceited little booby', `a very stupid fellow', `a mischievous destroyer'. Those are the sorts of attitudes that Menzies had to his successors, just as he had contempt for his contemporaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the lasting legacies that Menzies gave the Liberal Party was that he destroyed anybody who was a possible rival or a challenge to his leadership. Such were the problems he had with the need for personal power.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We in South Australia have some major winegrowing areas in the Barossa and Clare valleys, in the Coonawarra in the State's south-east, at McLaren Vale just south of Adelaide, and in the Riverland, which is a major wine grape producer. The Adelaide Hills and Langhorne Creek are smaller producing areas but their wines are of no less quality for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our wine industry is world class and highly competitive. Its 97 per cent share of the Australian market represents a substantial turnaround from our position only 10 years ago when&mdash;it is very hard to believe; when researching this speech I was surprised when reminded of it&mdash;Australia was a net importer of wine. We are now a net exporter, with overseas sales accounting for 20 per cent of total production, and we have increased from negligible levels of just a few years ago to 77.6 million litres, which is worth $234m in 1991-92. The industry is now confident of achieving exports of wine worth $1 billion by the turn of the century and, given the burgeoning markets of well-off, well-earning middle-class people in the Asian economies to our north, as their consumption habits shift a bit more in our direction this is a very realistic goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will go a long way to eliminating this present current account deficit if we can emulate the wine industry more widely. This wine industry is the result of various stages of production that are carried out in Australia&mdash;crushing, distilling, blending, packaging and so on&mdash;which add approximately seven times the farm gate value of the raw material to the finished product. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to imagine what the effect would be of adding seven times the value of the entire primary export crop of this country, right across the board. Basically, in the wine industry this means that wages are paid to 10,000 Australian workers, $1.2 billion worth of sales to Australian retailers are cashed up, transport costs are paid to Australian transport companies, the costs of packaging materials are paid to Australian packagers, and also $400m worth of Commonwealth and State taxes are derived from the industry. This can be reinvested in our domestic economy in various ways and needs to be in capital equipment, building and financial services.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are not my words. I hope I would not put together a speech which was quite so boring! They are the words of the former member for Adelaide, Dr Catley, who stood in this place in defence of the South Australian wine industry some 12 months ago almost to the day. It is pertinent for this chamber to ask itself this morning: what is the present honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) doing about the wine industry?

We on this side of the parliament believe in tax equity. That is why we proposed a goods and services tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. To take up that interjection from the honourable member for Lilley, the wine industry would be far better off with a 15 per cent GST and no sales tax than with a 31 per cent sales tax, as any fool can see. But in the case of tax equity, in the case of the proposal that came from the brewers and the spirits industry, let us recognise that there is no parallel to be drawn between the brewing and the spirits industries and the wine industry. The honourable member for Hunter knows that, if he is honest about it. What does one do in the case of spirits or brewing? All one does is take hops and barley and add water in what is effectively a factory making and annual production. What happens in the case of the spirits industry? One takes sugar, an annual crop, and does precisely the same thing&mdash;in many cases with waste product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the wine industry? Here one has to take root stocks that are suitable to a particular soil type, plant them, trellis them, and wait&mdash;as the honourable member for Hunter knows&mdash;at least three years, if lucky, to get into production and 10 years to break even. Having done all of that&mdash;is this any parallel with the brewing industry?&mdash;one has to harvest the product gently, either manually or, if by machinery, then only at night. Having done that, the product has to be laid down and blended, with all the art that is the wine industry, and exposed to maturation over an extended period of time. So let us have no nonsense, as the honourable member for Hunter knows, about this question of tax equity, because the simple reality is that there is no parallel between the brewing and spirits industries and the wine industry. That is not the opinion of the opposition. That is the opinion of our major wine competitors in Europe. For example, none of the tax measures in France, in Spain, in Italy and in Portugal are as severe as our existing tax measures, let alone the additional burden of a 55 per cent hike in the tax on wine as proposed by the government and, frankly, not defended by anyone on the government benches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the other issue that people raise? They say, `We ought to be sensitive about health'. So we should. But the wine industry is the one alcohol producing industry that can claim to have had some real involvement in educating Australians about healthy drinking, because the wine industry has a vested interest&mdash;and I note that the honourable member for Lilley is acknowledging this point&mdash;in seeing that people's drinking habits are healthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one area of the wine industry that offers a decidedly healthy alternative to every Australian&mdash;even those with an alcohol problem&mdash;is the production of lower alcohol wines. What has the government in this budget done to the production of low alcohol wines? Do honourable members know what has happened to wine makers&mdash;and this is a matter largely overlooked by the parliament&mdash;producing wines of an alcohol content of under 1.15 per cent? The government has lifted the tax on those people, not by 55 per cent but by 110 per cent. How can that be defended? How can it be defended when the simple reality is that that is a tax being borne by low alcohol wines, the alcohol content of which is, in most instances, less than 0.5 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our usual exercise in consistency we can claim on this side of the House to have been honourable about this. We accepted that the wine industry ought to bear some sort of tax burden, so we did not vote against the first 20 per cent. We accepted that. We did not like it, but we tolerated it and so did the industry. But there can be no defence for this 55 per cent hike. We will not wear it, and if the government is wondering where we will be when next this matter is considered we will be opposing any increase in tax on wine in the interests of our electorate and the nation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know why they do not want to argue this case in terms of tax equity. They do not want to argue this case in terms of tax equity because they do not believe in tax equity. They have not changed their approach to tax; they still support a system of flat taxation and they still support a GST so, quite naturally, they would want to avoid any argument about tax equity in relation to this matter. In the budget the sales tax on alcoholic wine and cider and other similar alcoholic beverages was increased from 20 per cent to 31 per cent from midnight on 17 August. It is the height of hypocrisy to argue that this change is not equitable&mdash;the absolute height of hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wine has had special treatment over the years and, during the time it has had that special treatment, it has built up a very solid base, both domestically and for export. It is crazy to say that such a measure proposed by the government would cripple the industry. This is a classic example of special pleading from a vested interest which is seeking to maintain a regressive form of taxation and a special advantage for an industry which, frankly, does not require it. It is seeking to give an industry special treatment against all other similar industries. The government's proposals are fair; the existing position is quite unfair and quite regressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not mind slugging a punter who wants to have a pot of beer about one third on tax while someone who is drinking a glass of wine, after these measures have come in, will be slugged about 17 1/2 per cent. Even under these measures, wine still has a very considerable advantage over beer, and this measure is about bringing some fairness back into the taxation of alcoholic beverages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a compelling case for the wine industry making a larger contribution to revenue. Prior to this budget Penfolds Grange Hermitage was taxed at the same rate as lemonade. That is the opposition's idea of tax equity. We understand that; that is what the last election campaign was about. The opposition does not mind taxing everybody 15 per cent on the essentials of life, such as food and clothing, and it did not mind bringing down the price of luxury cars, furs and so on. That is the opposition's idea of equity&mdash;paying the same tax on lemonade as on Penfolds Grange Hermitage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wine has always been lightly taxed in this country compared to beer. That is because beer is subject not only to a sales tax but also to an excise tax. What the government is saying in these arrangements is that it will not be imposing an excise tax on wine, and that it will continue to give the wine industry very privileged treatment. Its privileged treatment is set to continue, which makes it even more puzzling why the wine industry did not accept the very legitimate compromise put forward by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in recent days. Wine will continue to enjoy a relative advantage over beer and spirits well into the future and, to that extent, inequities in the treatment of alcoholic beverages will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just look at some examples. We find that somebody who is buying a four-litre cask of wine will be paying 17 1/2 per cent of the post-budget purchase price in a form of Commonwealth taxation. Let us just think about that. That is a 17 1/2 per cent Commonwealth taxation on wine, so when punters go into the pub and pick up a glass of wine, they are paying about 17 1/2 per cent. But what happens if they are having a pot or a middy of beer? The tax is 32 per cent, one-third of the price. How can one justify that inequity continuing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take these examples further. The comparison is even more stark if we look at the dollars per litre of alcohol taken in Commonwealth taxation. On cask wine, it will be just over $3 per litre of alcohol compared with $18.50 per litre of alcohol for beer. The tax is $3 for wine but $18.50 for beer. That is the case for change. That is why the government has taken up the case. The government has also given a clear commitment in the budget papers that the excise-free status of wine will continue, and that guarantees the discrepancy. It is very clear that, under the new arrangements, wine still has a very considerable advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now deal with some of the arguments put about the effect on the wine industry. The government has chosen an approach which, whilst reducing the taxation advantages, still gives very considerable advantages. Let us have a look at what it would do to, say, a $10 bottle of wine. The cost would increase by only about 50c and, similarly, it would increase by about 50c for a seven-litre cask of wine. I know that honourable members are very moderate in their behaviour in this place, but I am sure that they have managed to visit, in their time, restaurants around this country. I have been to a local Chinese restaurant, say, and paid up to $10 for a bottle of wine. I could go to a similar restaurant down the road&mdash;perhaps to one that has a more expensive menu&mdash;and pay twice the price. The fact of the matter is that there are vast discrepancies in the price of wines in restaurants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about here is an increase in Commonwealth taxation of around 50c. Honourable members opposite cannot justify the tales of horror and woe which they and the wine industry are peddling around this place about a dramatic effect on consumption. When this issue was last revisited in 1984 and the wholesale sales tax arrangements were changed, there was no significant impact on consumption, nor was there over time. The growth of the wine industry in recent times has been in the export sector, and the wholesale sales taxes do not apply to the export sector, so an argument cannot be maintained in this place that there will be some dramatic impact on consumption and, in turn, on production and, in turn, on employment in the industry. It is simply not sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the sales tax rate was increased to 20 per cent, all of these tales of woe were put about. It was predicted by the industry that there would be a 3.4 per cent downturn in 1986-87 but, in fact, cask and bottle sales increased by 1.86 per cent. Once again, it is the height of hypocrisy to be mounting the argument that consumption will be dramatically affected. The fact of the matter is that this is a very legitimate budget measure, which is introducing a degree of fairness into the taxation system and providing revenue for the government, so that it can pursue its very legitimate deficit reduction strategy&mdash;which is something one would think the opposition would have thought was a very important priority for any government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we now have this political coalition of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson); the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock); the Liberal Party of Australia, the National Party of Australia; and the Greens. They are all getting behind the champagne, chardonnay and camembert set and are arguing for equity. That is just absolutely incredible. How dare the Greens talk about equity in the taxation system and come forth and support such an inequitable arrangement that is being supported by the Liberal and National parties! I think it really does demonstrate just how absolutely bloody-minded the opposition is in its treatment of all of the budget measures that have been debated in this place over recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made a very generous offer to the wine industry, which it did not take up, and it has not been taken up because the opposition, the Liberal and National parties, aided and abetted by the Greens, have decided on a process of maximum political destabilisation in this House. Is it any wonder that someone like Malcolm Fraser has had the following statements to make about the tactics of the Liberal and National parties:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate is running the risk of making Australia ungovernable. It is running the risk of turning the annual budget process into a series of bargains and trade-offs similar to those which occur in the United States. Good budgets are more often unpopular than popular. It is easy therefore for the Senate to seize such moments to destroy the integrity of a budget.</PARA>
<PARA>So what we now have is this incredible coalition of the Liberal and National parties and the Greens setting out to destroy the integrity of the budget process by supporting something as outrageous as the privileged treatment of wine in terms of taxation. What an incredible coalition it is. We now have the Greens supporting the Liberal and National parties in their pursuit of flat taxation and in their pursuit of unfair taxation arrangements. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to alert the public generally, and ageing Australians specifically, to inconsistencies in the prescription and dispensing of drugs under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which at present is costing pensioners and other elderly people far more than is necessary. The elderly and infirm spend a far greater proportion of their income on drugs than is average, so it is even more necessary now, during the present severe recession, that the cost of their prescriptions should be minimised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `generic' or `benchmark' drug affair, which has been simmering for years, was catapulted to public notice recently when New South Wales north coast pharmacist, Stuart Keen, that `latter day Robin Hood', took on the medical and pharmaceutical establishment by coming out fighting for his customers' right to choose less costly benchmark brand drugs as against the more expensive better known premium brands. This was documented on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> of 6 July this year and followed by another segment presented once again on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, this time on 25 August in Sydney and 26 August in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both programs stated the original premise&mdash;that is, pensioners are paying more than they need to for their life-saving drugs. Some of our elderly citizens are constantly reliant on a number of drugs to keep them alive. So the cost of prescriptions for life-saving drugs can be exorbitant. It is ludicrous, and bordering on the criminal, that in many instances these prescriptions are obtainable at a much lower cost&mdash;that is, if generic or benchmark brands are prescribed instead of the premium brands normally favoured by doctors and stocked by pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that doctors deliberately prescribe dearer drugs for any kind of kickback from drug companies for personal gain. Largely, it is a matter of habit and lack of available time. Doctors are very busy and it is so much easier to prescribe the brand that he or she is familiar with than to look up the equivalent benchmark brand which would be prescribed at a lower cost to the patient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give honourable members some idea of the difference in costs, if the benchmark brand for a commonly prescribed treatment for blood pressure, Noten, is used instead of the premium brand, Tenormin, each prescription will cost $1 less to the patient. In other words, the pensioner will pay $2.60 for Noten and $3.60 for Tenormin even though the drugs are identical. To patients off the PBS, Tenormin will cost $11.18 while Noten is $1 cheaper at $10.18. Another more extreme example is to be found in the dispensing of one of the cortisone based ointments, Cinchocaine hydrochloride with hydrocortisone ointment 2 grams x 15, where the difference is a staggering $16.89 per prescription. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a considerable difference in cost, particularly to a person on a low income. When the patient takes the prescription to the pharmacist, further difficulties are encountered. The script is usually written for the premium brand drug. If a patient requests the cheaper benchmark alternative, as is his or her right, pharmacists have to cover themselves legally by making a phone call to the doctor concerned to verify substitution, which can be a lengthy and cumbersome process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is, of course, supposing that the pharmacist stocks the benchmark brand, which is not always the case. Pharmacist Stuart Keen commends the government's minimum pricing policy, but asserts that the policy and the law are not walking along the same road. In tenaciously taking his courageous stand to alert people to the existence of benchmark brand drugs in place of the more expensive premium brands for the financial benefit of his customers, he has incurred the wrath of the law, and fears that it could cost him his career. He is currently being investigated and is `under threat of prosecution' by Health Insurance Commission officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of both presentations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, elderly citizens, who had been dispensed cheaper benchmark brands by Mr Keen, gave evidence of harassment and terror tactics by Health Insurance Commission officers who were investigating. It should be stressed here that Stuart Keen has not dispensed a benchmark drug against the prescription of any doctor since the irregularities of the law were made clear to him. He has subsequently sought every possible means of persuading doctors to allow people the alternative, if they should so wish, and has written letters and made phone calls to this end. I would say that at least in the Wingham area the community is well aware of people's right to choose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the question as to whether benchmark brands are different from dearer brands, the answer is in the negative. As drugs or chemicals they are identical. They have the same active ingredients and the same clinical effects as the dearer brands. There may be differences in colour, shape and the agents that bind the active ingredients together, but these do not change the clinical effect of the medication. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, all drug products listed under the PBS schedule have to meet the strict standards of quality, safety and efficacy set by the Drug Evaluation Committee and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In defence of benchmark brands, many minimum price brands have been listed under the PBS for a number of years and are widely used in Australian hospitals, including the country's leading teaching hospitals. This means that people have been using the minimum price brands and have switched brands satisfactorily, often without knowing it. They have probably used one brand before going into hospital, have been switched to a lower priced brand whilst in hospital and then, when they have returned home, have changed to another brand, depending on their doctor's preferences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in Australia are lagging behind other comparable countries as far as lower priced drugs are concerned. This is particularly true of the United States of America where benchmark brands are used widely. Dr Con Costa, President of the Doctors Reform Society, wrote recently of the `universal use of generics in the public hospital system, with more than 80 per cent generic prescribing, even in the US privatised health system'. In Great Britain it is estimated that 45 per cent to 49 per cent of all NHS prescriptions are of the lower priced variety and their use is also increasing in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation has issued a press statement to the effect that benchmark brands of drugs should be more readily available. On 7 July, Mrs Norah McGuire, the National Secretary of the APSF, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pensioners should not have to pay for expensive brands of drugs when cheaper ones are available and just as good.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Consumers Association on the same day, 7 July, took matters even further. Mr Phil Marchionni, deputy manager of policy and public affairs for the ACA, issued a press statement that said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some American states pharmacists can substitute generic drugs for brand name versions prescribed by doctors. In New Zealand, similar proposals are in the pipeline. Australian pharmacists should be able to dispense cheaper generic drugs.</PARA>
<PARA>He added that generic drugs are almost always the cheapest. I am sure that everyone in this place would agree that doctors, by the very nature of their profession, are, above all, kind people. Surely in that case it should be easy for them to help patients to save on their budgets. When benchmark brands are prescribed, the average saving is approximately $1.30 per prescription. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association have so far declared their extreme opposition to the prescription and dispensing of benchmark drugs. One would hope that, given the obvious benefits to the patient, this ultra-conservatism will change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend Stuart Keen for his tenacity in bringing the case for the prescription of benchmark drugs for the financial benefit of the patient to the public eye. In the original <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, commented that Mr Keen's heart was in the right place but he worried about the brain. On the evidence, the brain seems to be right too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some interesting late developments in this drug saga. Firstly, it has come to my notice that Rhone-Poulenc, a leading drug company which used to be known as May and Baker in Australia, has produced a benchmark drug, Uruvale, in direct competition with its own premium brand drug Orudis, and subsequently added $1.20 in price to its own premium brand. Apparently there have been other similar examples of this practice. As well as this, Stuart Keen is finding that local doctors are being extremely helpful, subsequent to pressure from the public, and even the Pharmacy Guild is less recalcitrant than previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the fact still remains that probably the great bulk of members of the Australian population are unaware of their choice with regard to prescription drugs. They should have that choice. In conclusion, I seek to table an advertisement from Canada which shows the link between the benchmark and premium drug. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My grievance is about what I would consider to be the noxious weed of negativity which is being sewn by a lot of the local media in my state, and which is trying to choke the spirit of Sydney's western suburbs. Sydney's west, which I am proud to say I was born in and where I have lived all my life, contains my electorate of Prospect. It also has a population in excess of 1.3 million people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become fodder for the media over the years. Endless streams of negative stories are now appearing about crime, unemployment and crises in that area. They hit the headlines; they make the news bulletins. The most recent attention grabber was a news report which publicised the ramblings of a northern beaches mayor who blamed us westies for fouling Manly's beaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Residents of the western suburbs were portrayed as being environmental louts, visiting the beaches and leaving their rubbish behind them, ruining the beauty of the beaches. This statement was not, of course, backed by any statistics or facts. At the time I put it down to the ramblings of a person who needed to be certified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, while that bulletin was so ridiculous that people in our region glossed over it, yawned and laughed at the audacity of it, other articles have been more damaging. One was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 17 July of this year. I was shocked to find that according to that article the western suburbs was supposed to have developed an underclass, a class which apparently has all but taken over my electorate of Prospect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That story started on page 1 of a reputable newspaper, and then continued in a lengthy series throughout that edition and also in the following editions of that week. It concentrated on a youth drop-in centre in my electorate nicknamed `the shed'. The journalist said that about a hundred kids who frequent the shed&mdash;a cold and draughty girl guides hall&mdash;had given up on their lives because they thought they would never find a job. That journalist wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most would be regarded as dunces but their teacher says that, on the contrary, they have worked out that there are no jobs for poorer people like themselves, so why go to a normal school?</PARA>
<PARA>The journalist went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many, The Shed is the end of the line. Most have already dropped out of school.</PARA>
<PARA>I can assure honourable members that the shed is not part of a formal education system within my electorate. It is run by the Fairfield Community Resource Centre, which is funded by grants from both federal and state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, articles like this seem to always appear when people want re-funding of particular programs, which is what a lot of this story was about. For some reason, journalists continue to leap on any chance they get to portray western Sydney, and often my electorate, in a bad light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been asked to launch a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Into the West </EMPHASIS>next week. It is written by Dianne Powell, a very interesting person, whose father many years ago was mayor of our city. In her book, Ms Powell has chronicled press coverage of the western suburbs throughout the years. Through her work it is possible for all to see the continual and constant barrage of slings and arrows fired at Sydney's west by numerous journalists who have never taken the time&mdash;and this is what I am very concerned about&mdash;to travel out of the city and its immediate suburbs and come and see where the real people live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, it was interesting in reading through that book prior to my launching it next week to discover that what I am alarmed at now has been a continual thing; it goes back to the late 1800s. I grant it that there are times when the media has a point. But why do journalists continually harp on the negative issues and gloss over the very positive ones?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with some articles that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> put out about unemployment, particularly about the city of Fairfield, which is in my electorate of Prospect. But why do the same articles not mention that half of Fairfield's unemployed cannot speak adequate English? Why is Fairfield not mentioned as Australia's most multicultural city? While that comes with many rewards, we know there is a downside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fairfield itself takes in more first arrivals than any other area in Australia. When I say first arrivals I mean our new arrivals coming from overseas. A lot of these people do not speak English at the time they arrive. Or, if they do, they do not have adequate levels of English to help them to get jobs in their first year. However, we have recognised that problem and we are doing something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to see in June this year that something like 500 people graduated from the Fairfield and Cabramatta adult migrant English centres. Another 500 are going to graduate in December and we expect another 500 within the next six months after that. But what is interesting about that success rate is that amongst those first 500 graduates something like five per cent were already employed before they had graduated. There were some 70 who were in training courses, before the graduation took place, for hospitality and clerical industries, and over 180 were enrolled for further language training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are pushing our way out of the valley of unemployment in Fairfield and I am proud of how determined my constituents are in their search for work. These are people who are eager to give something back to Australia and I am glad that through our federal government programs we are helping them to achieve their goals. However, I am not glad that the press continues to dwell on the downside and this certainly casts a pall over any achievements that we have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people read often enough that Fairfield is a city full of `the underclass' then they could start to believe it, and that would be a terrible shame. I do not want people who have travelled to Australia from more than 114 countries to arrive here and believe that they have no hope. Fairfield is a city of hope despite the continual bad press. I do not want long-term residents to think that their home is a city of hopelessness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five of the largest high schools in Australia are contained within my electorate and they are jam-packed with children who have a thirst for knowledge. Every year these and all other schools in Prospect turn out bright, educated individuals determined to make their mark. These young minds should not be discouraged by journalists anxious to fill their pages or air time with hard luck stories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because my electorate is such a multicultural and working-class area, I believe journalists have a preconceived idea of what happens in Prospect. Through these preconceived notions they assume that there will be problems at schools and in the streets. They assume that racism will rear its ugly head and cause numerous fights and even riots. Worst of all they assume that because people have been unemployed they will continue to stay unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will agree with me that this is not the case. Students in my electorate have certainly not given up the fight. They are talented, they are ambitious and they are bright. In fact, two weeks ago the largest school in New South Wales, Fairfield High School, celebrated its annual multicultural day. Group after group took to the stage and celebrated with their cultural songs, their dancing and their musicians. They had something like 1,000 students participating. These children who have revelled in their own culture are making a wonderful contribution and merging into Australia's way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also delighted to be involved in Prairiewood High School's environment day recently. The school is working hard to tie environmental issues into all of its lessons. Students have cultivated their own pesticide free greenhouse gardens. They have written plays and even transformed an ugly piece of land adjoining the school into a tree lined haven for outdoor studying. One class has even taken over the recycling collection. These are wonderful students and, if all students throughout Australia are as bright as those kids, Australia has a wonderful future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message I want to get across in the limited time left to me is that I wish journalists writing about western Sydney would take the time, the effort and the trouble to come out and be part of our community and see what we have to offer. I have made complimentary statements before in this House about certain journalists and the way that they have come out and inspected our area and written articles that are factual and truthful. I challenge other journalists now to make the choice to have first-hand experience in what they are writing about, to meet the people, see the facilities and look at the programs that are in existence, not only in my electorate of Prospect within the city of Fairfield but particularly in the western region of Sydney. I would hope that then we would have journalists writing the true facts&mdash;that it is an area of growth, an area that could be tied into the United Nations but, most particularly, an area where people have hope for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I am focusing on the role of the family in Australian society, and want to put the proposition to the House that the family ought to be considered as the fourth and most fundamental tier of government because, unless the family functions effectively, the other tiers of government also struggle to deliver their programs effectively to our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monday of this week marked the 50th anniversary of Dame Enid Lyons's entry into parliament. Quite a bit has been made of her entry into parliament, and I remind honourable members that she was the first female parliamentarian and represented my electorate back in those times. In her maiden speech she quoted King George V:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The foundation of a nation's greatness is in the homes of its people.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we could do well to reflect on that aspect of her speech, particularly during this week as we are celebrating Dame Enid's entry into parliament.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only was the Lyons family very prominent in Australian political history and made a tremendous contribution to it from many different aspects, but also it was a tremendous family. In fact, a lot of honourable members in this House would know that there were 12 children in the family, of whom one died very early in life and 11 survived&mdash;quite a formidable number to many of us today. Both Joseph and Enid Lyons were driven by the idea of the importance of the family as the fundamental unit in society, and much of their life apart from national life really did focus on encouraging family life. The principle of family unity, love and loyalty in a family unit pervaded the whole of their private and public life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many in the coalition the statement quoted by Dame Enid has become a motto. What does it mean to claim that the foundation of a nation's greatness is in the homes of its people? I want to make three particular points. In the first place, it means that the family is the fundamental social unit in which we all grow up and experience most of our lives. A grouping of people who are linked by blood, marriage or adoption and who reside in the same home is a common definition of the family. Contrary to claims sometimes made that the nuclear or traditional family is fast disappearing and despite the rapid growth in sole parent families, the 1991 census shows that the overwhelming majority of dependent children still live in homes with two parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the impression today that the structure of families is really disappearing but, when we go to the statistics, we find that about 90 per cent of Australians live in a social structure which all of us would say is a family. I think we are being deceived sometimes by the very narrow definition of the traditional or the normal family as two adults with two children. If there are three children, it is not normal; if there is a grandparent living with one child and mum and dad, it is still not regarded as a traditional, normal family. I think that that is nonsense. There is a great diversity of family groupings, and it is very important that we are aware of how this is sometimes portrayed to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family provides the structure for social nurturing of children and young people and the avenue whereby adults express their aspirations, hopes and fears and responsibilities within a mutually supportive group. The Institute of Family Studies reports that 71 per cent of workers nominate family as the source of their greatest satisfaction in life. So it is this social unit that we live with that is of fundamental importance to us all. It is the greatest of boons to be fortunate enough to be born into a strong, healthy family. One of the best things we can do with our lives, particularly as adults, is to help create a good family ourselves. It is one of the greatest things we can do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic provision is physical care and food and clothing and shelter, but more vital is the emotional care that the family provides for the child to feel loved and wanted, to develop good self-esteem and a general sense of worth. I think it is the same for adults as well, that a lot of our self-worth comes from our children. This is fundamental to our sense of dignity and wellbeing and just living life in a very positive sense instead of becoming sometimes depressed, as many people seem to today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If children grow up in an atmosphere of love and warmth, they will become better equipped to cope with the pressures of adult life. The family is responsible for conveying attitudes and is responsible for the moral development of the child. Thus, the attitude children learn towards authority figures such as teachers and police will be reflected in the way in which they respond to such people and the degree to which they become good citizens. If we have good citizens, we have a healthy nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family is the first experience children have of working within a community. In this fundamental social unit they learn to cooperate, share, display consideration, be honest, trustworthy&mdash;and sometimes dishonest, of course, but that is part of that nurturing at that stage&mdash;and reliable, to be hardworking and to develop a work ethic. Yet the value placed by governments today on the family does not reflect the vital importance family life plays in the overall wellbeing of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Family Law Act effectively minimises parents' responsibilities to each other and also casualises the father's responsibilities. I came across this quote about the situation in the United States:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As for marriageable men, the system in the United States&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I do think it does tend to also accord here in Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">makes them economically useless. Their potential role as husbands and custodial fathers is squeezed out by the government and so they seek other outlets of affirmation.</PARA>
<PARA>There is that tendency in the way in which our systems have grown up. In 1993, not only do we see governments allowing families to wither on the vine, as the saying goes, but also an ever increasing intrusion by governments into the dynamics of family life, an intrusion based on the false conception that freedom for children and young adults is of higher importance than the exercise of responsible authority by parents. Fundamental to children being provided with the right atmosphere in which to grow up from being a total dependant to being independent is that parents be supported by the institutions of the state and not undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is a sign of the times that more people today owe their livelihood to serving children in distress than ever before in history. Social workers deal with young homeless and street kids. Children turn to drugs and alcohol and welfare workers assist in their rehabilitation. The list could go on. This is fundamentally because families are not functioning as all of us would prefer them to, and I do believe that government systems which are now in place, both at state and federal levels, are not giving the supportive structures to family life that they should. All government programs are ultimately dependent for success on the good health of families. A sound family policy is almost the whole of a good welfare policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point which I raise, since time is brief, is that the family is also a fundamental administrative unit, apart from being a social unit. It is the unit on which decisions can be made, often without needing to have laws and regulations to make those decisions. Because there is mutual trust, I believe governments should recognise the fundamental importance of the family as an administrative unit in society. There has been a tendency over the last 50 or 100 years to move away from the family and for governments to believe, at all tiers, that administration is really that which is done by their bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the House today that we really should be focusing much more clearly on having strong family life and recognising the family's administrative role in society. If we did that, I believe that we would have a healthier society. We would have a stronger society and we would have less fallout than we have at the present time in a whole range of social areas.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity today to refer to a matter which is too seldom mentioned in this House. I refer, of course, to the catastrophic effect that our trade policies are having on the textile and clothing industry throughout our country. In Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, and in other areas, the employment opportunities lost have been quite significant, and that is a tragedy. I understand economics, and I understand the difficulties when we have tariff protection for industries. I also understand the advantages that this country would gain from free trade, from a level playing field approach. I know that we are an island nation; that we have too few people in this country to consume all the things we produce; and that our future is dependent upon our ability to sell our goods, our commodities and our produce overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am well aware that we are victim to the demands of the rest of the world. I often recall the story about when the Fraser government tried to impose restrictions on Asian nations exporting garments into Australia. Mr Fraser, as Prime Minister, went up to Malaysia and saw a number of Australian ships in the port. Those ships were still there four days later. He made diplomatic inquiries and asked, `Why are you not unloading the Australian goods which are there for your people to use?'. He was told that, because Australia had recently increased the tariff barriers which prevented Asian garments from coming into Australia, the Asians were not interested in taking the goods which we had exported to Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand that. If somebody denies the products which you want them to take, it is all right&mdash;and it is fair, I guess&mdash;for them to say, `All right. You do not want our garments? Then keep your wool. Keep your wheat. Keep your dairy products. Keep your iron ore and your coal!'. It is a very complex problem, but we must always be aware that the people who are the victims, the people who suffer as a result of trade arrangements, become tragic figures when they lose their jobs and there are no employment opportunities available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a grievance debate&mdash;I guess that we have on these occasions an opportunity to grizzle, but also I think a grievance debate allow speakers to grieve&mdash;and today I want to grieve about what is happening to the textile and clothing and even footwear industries in this country. I do not want to specifically dwell on footwear production, because I have no footwear factories in my electorate, but I do have textile and clothing factories, and I grieve for the workers who are currently employed in those endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years, I guess since its early days, a large part of the Hunter electorate&mdash;places like Maitland, Cessnock, Kurri, Weston, et cetera&mdash;has been almost entirely dependent upon coal production. It has a very low industrial base and it is not at all diverse. It was essentially dependent upon coal. When people left school they went into the coal industry, although quite a few had no taste for the coal industry and went off to universities or teachers colleges. There was work for the males but there were no employment opportunities for the females. I guess that is how it came about that we had quite substantial developments of textile and clothing factories within the area, not just in Newcastle but National Textiles at Maitland and Depict Fashions at Weston and Kurri. We had Casben there for a while, we have Bonds in Cessnock, and many other textile and clothing producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These factories at one time were quite substantial. They were big employers and they offered job opportunities, particularly for women. The men went into the mines; the women went into the textile and clothing factories. But now, and for the past couple of years, the textile and clothing industries in my electorate are being killed. The three major companies, National Textiles, Depict Fashions and Bonds, have been in the city of Cessnock for between 10 and 20 years. Each of them at its peak employed 700 people. There were more than 2,000 jobs for the women of the Cessnock area. These women employed in those factories had no chance of gaining jobs elsewhere, unless they left the area completely. Many of them were new arrivals to this country who had a language problem, but they were able to gain jobs in the textile and clothing factories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, each of these factories employed 700 people. Take somebody like Depict Fashions in Kurri-Weston: it shed a couple of hundred people; it shed another couple of hundred people; earlier this year it shed about 126 employees; and just last week it shed another 93 employees. It now has 50 employees. For how long will it have 50 employees? It grieves me to say so, but I believe not for much longer. It just cannot compete. With the gradual removal of tariffs, the protective measures which we used to have in place for our textile and clothing industries, we become completely at a loss to compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the government. We have guaranteed that there will be a 25 per cent level of protection at the turn of the century, but those on the other side are strong in their resolve to see our textile and clothing industries disappear. They have guaranteed zero protection by the year 2000. It is not hard to understand why we cannot compete. In Australia, at one of the factories I mentioned, a machinist would earn between $1,600 and $1,800 per month. These companies are now going offshore; they have their factories, their operations, in China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In China a machinist would receive $50 per month in the north and $20 per month in the south. There is no payroll tax, no super guarantee levy, no four-week holidays, no long service leave, no holiday loading. Australia does not want the type of tax regime which exists in China, Malaysia and Indonesia because there is no welfare in those countries. But that is the problem we face&mdash;that is the China syndrome. As well, we have the Asian syndrome in Australia, with subcontractors&mdash;backyard operators&mdash;operating out of their garages. An Australian made garment takes 20 minutes to manufacture and the cost of production may be $5 or $6. That is what it costs to make at, say, Bonds, Depict Fashions or National Textiles. A backyard operator paying non-award wages can produce the same garment for 50c or 60c. I hope that this government manages to find some measure for providing employment opportunities for those people who are being thrown on the unemployment scrap heap as a result of the removal of protection on the clothing industries. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today is with this government, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) for failing to produce balanced, if limited, reform of our industrial relations system, with the overall objectives of reducing institutionalised constraints, encouraging innovative solutions to work-pay relationship problems, and generally freeing up the labour market to encourage investment in new productive capacity, improving productivity and expanding the job market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year on 21 April, the Prime Minister addressed the Institute of Company Directors. He spelt out, in fairly precise terms, his vision for reform of our fairly ancient, archaic, very wordy and constrained centralised system of determining pay and conditions of employment. He said that over time the safety net of wages would become simpler, with fewer awards and fewer clauses. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For most employees and most businesses, wages and conditions of work would be determined by agreements worked out between the employer, the employees and their union.</PARA>
<PARA>I would argue a bit about the union element, since some 70 per cent of the work force is unrepresented by unions, but in general I have got no problems with his statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, coverage of the work force by enterprise agreements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to be close to one hundred per cent of employees under federal awards.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a fine objective. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And of course there are lots of employees who for one reason or another don't have a union to represent them.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not lots: 70 per cent of employees do not have unions to represent them. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are not enough enterprise bargains&mdash;and the bargains we do have are sometimes not sufficiently comprehensive.</PARA>
<PARA>That is demonstrably true. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to find a way of extending the coverage of agreements from being add-ons to awards, as they sometimes are today, to being full substitutes for awards.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to the Prime Minister: fine sentiments. I largely agree with his sentiments and the objectives of this vision, if that is what it was, of the direction that our industrial relations system should take. But what is the government actually producing? Last week the Minister for Industrial Relations leaked a document, which is in fact an in-principle agreement between himself as minister and the ACTU's negotiating committee, on industrial relations reform. When we examine that document we find that there are a whole range of reform measures proposed, not one of which will satisfy the criteria put forward by the Prime Minister in his 21 April speech. An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> earlier this year stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term answer to the unions' problem is to help workers and their employers improve productivity, job security and real incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the preoccupation of the unions with preserving their institutionalised power threatens their participation in genuine labour market reform.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the conundrum. The document, the in-principle agreement, lists item after item of further institutionalisation of the bureaucratic arm of trade unions' power: to give them more power either to disrupt or to control the system. In all of this agreement, in all of these seven pages, the word `employee' is written once and the word `unions' is written over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister wants to `strengthen the award system, in particular, to underpin enterprise bargaining'. I would not know how on earth the two sides of that statement are compatible. To strengthen the award system there is a bureaucratic procedural process that specifies in minute detail how employees shall work; where they shall work; when they shall work; how much they will be paid; what they shall not do; and what rules they shall conform to in terms of demarcation with other workers because they happen to belong to other unions. This is lodged in front of our quasi-judicial body, the Industrial Relations Commission, in page after page of bureaucratic speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Industrial Relations Commission is a unique body in the world: a group of lawyers-cum-judges, who make decisions about the lives of millions of Australians who never appear before the bench. Why do they not appear before the bench? Because they cannot. The only people who can appear before that bench are representatives of employers, that is, employer bureaucracies, and representatives of workers, that is, their unions&mdash;another bureaucracy. Three bureaucracies&mdash;the commission, the employers and the unions&mdash;decide what happens to Mary Bloggs and Joe Blow in their workplace in Coburg, Victoria. Terrific!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to strengthen the award system and the bureaucratic processes. In fact, that will destroy any chance that we have at true enterprise bargaining which tries to get those three partners out of the way of the principal combatants, if there must be combat&mdash;that is, the employer and his work force&mdash;to allow them to sit down together and talk and make sensible decisions about how they will run the business together and how they will pay for the work that is done and under what constraints they will operate without interposing wills by unions, employer bodies or the IRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is going to set up a new court `to deal with unfair dismissals'&mdash;a whole new arm of the industrial relations court. We will have another bureaucratic procedure, another lot of judges and another lot of lawyers and they will set up their own ethos over time, as has happened in the Family Court.

So one cannot trade in some of the benefits under the centralised award for something preferred under an enterprise agreement. The minister is going to establish a new division of the AIRC to deal with agreements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bring to the attention of the House the now pressing situation of the Chinese students in Australia. Since our Olympic victory, we can expect to receive a vastly increased amount of world media attention between now and the year 2000. We must be extra careful not to besmirch our very favourable international image by an ill-considered and mistaken decision on this matter. The Tiananmen Square massacre saw about 18,000 Chinese students granted special visas, and these students have been joined by approximately 9,000 dependents and relatives. This situation is complicated by about 17,000 Chinese who, after Tiananmen Square, made visa applications to remain in Australia. If we decide to expel some or all of these people, we must be clearly aware that we are sending them back to tyranny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I met Professor Harry Wu when he was in Australia in May of this year. He is the author of a serious study of the Chinese Gulag and was himself jailed for 19 years. His study clearly shows the existence of industrial slave labour camps in China today. Human rights and democracy are not part of the face of China today. I am aware that some members of the established Chinese community in Australia&mdash;people from parts of Asia other than mainland China&mdash;have not been as charitable to some of these new arrivals as they might have been. My view is that, whilst obviously not every student is perfect, nevertheless the Australian way is to err on the side of generosity. </PARA>

I would urge the government to also be compassionate to the group of people who, since this dreadful event, are making their lives in Australia amongst us. The immigration of people to Australia is our greatest resource. One has only to see the situation and the wealth of a city like Singapore to see what can be achieved when a nation's only resource is people. I am proud to be here today and to be advocating that those students who were here before the Tiananmen Square massacre must be granted the full right to live in Australia and to join our national family. And those who have come since should also be considered in the framework of Australia's generosity. </PARA>

An unfavourable decision will attract even more attention, and people will ask whether the decision is race based. Of course, everyone will say that there is no racial prejudice in an unfavourable decision, but our critics and enemies in Asia will ask, `When did Australians ever deport thousands of English or Europeans?'. I urge all honourable members to be especially aware of the trap right in front of us. For once, let us not put politics first, but put Australia first. </PARA>

I am not a racist and I am also not a pessimist. I have great confidence that we can adopt a policy of building our homeland without destroying it environmentally or socially. The opponents of this view are basically racist and thus are cultural pessimists who think that we are not intelligent enough to help ourselves. </PARA>

The triumph that followed this decision, multicultural Australia, must now be backed up by a serious example of national self-confidence. </PARA>

Australia is being put together by none of these and this is a stroke of genius on our part. As far as I can see, Australia is the only nation in the world to be constructing itself on the basis of desire. Anyone who wants to be Australian, to live here with us, to share our ups and downs and share our future as it unfolds can do so. People do not have to be white; they have to want to be with us. People do not have to be Christian; they have to want to be with us. They do not have to be born here; they have to want to be with us.

We cut the cost of production in tobacco almost clean in half. It was a brilliant exercise by an industry that had to become competitive and most certainly became competitive in a period of nine or 10 years. Where did it get us? Zimbabwe simply lowered the value of its dollar to such an extent that its tobacco again came in 40 or 50 per cent cheaper than our product. At the same time as Zimbabwe was lowering the value of its currency, we were in fact purchasing dollars at 100 miles an hour and propping up our currency. In fact, the then Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), by his actions in raising interest rates and buying in the dollar, forced the dollar up. It fell to 59c in 1986 and he forced it up over the next 12 months to around 70c. Now he has run out of money and he has run out of ideas. </PARA>

How can we become competitive when wage structures in Central America are $2 a day and we have to pay, by law, between $8 and $10 an hour for our labour in Australia? I am 100 per cent behind our paying $8 to $10 an hour in Australia&mdash;that is what we should have in Australia&mdash;but if the government allows bananas to come in from overseas our banana producers have only two alternatives. One is to stop growing bananas, because they will grow at a loss, and the other is to go down to $2 a day wage levels to be able to compete. There is no other possibility. This parliament must make the decision whether we want to wipe out the $350 million a year banana industry and put another 10,000 or 20,000 Australians on the dole queues or whether we want to get away from this silly, stupid attitude. The principle is a good principle, but not when it is taken to the extreme lengths that it has been taken to at the present moment.

What family has had a seaside holiday and not gone to visit a lighthouse?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to have two such lighthouses in my electorate. One is at Sugarloaf Point, Seal Rocks, adjacent to the Myall Lakes National Park.

It is the outer light at Port Stephens that I wish to speak about in particular today because, like most lighthouses, it is under threat. Modern ships do not require lighthouses because they have more sophisticated means of communication which allow the ships to position themselves. </PARA>

I ask: who has the right to sell this property of such significance, property that is owned by the Australian people, was never paid for by anyone and where the costs of running the lighthouses have been funded by commercial shipping?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am beginning to wonder whether John Laws is right about the honourable member for Flinders. The fact is that the High Court decided that the states could extinguish native title, and not only could but had done so wholesale for 200 years. It is a matter of simple law that that is the position. No-one except perhaps the honourable member for Flinders would doubt that that is the position. None of the players in this game has ever suggested that anything other than that is the position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, they can only do so in accordance with the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. In other words, they cannot extinguish native title in a way that is discriminatory against Aboriginal people. They cannot do that because the High Court decided that they could not do that. That, of course, is the government's position too, that native title should not be extinguished in a discriminatory way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, is not the position of the Liberal Party.

But that is not the government's position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple position is that we are negotiating with the cooperating states and we hope to reach agreement with them because we think that is the best and the most sensible solution for Australia, for the Aboriginal people and for reconciliation generally.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prepayments of annual leave are subject to PAYE deductions as follows: each week's leave pay is subject to deductions at the same rate as a normal week's pay on the basis of the PAYE tables in force at the time of the payment. The annual leave loading payment up to $320 is not subject to PAYE deductions unless the employee requests it to be. This is because the PAYE tables are designed to recover enough deductions from 52 weeks normal pay to cover the tax on that level of annual leave loading as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, of course, the government's intention that the PAYE system should operate in the normal way in relation to annual leave prepayments made this December as people take their annual holidays. Indeed, the budget provides for income tax cuts from 15 November, and therefore those cuts and the rates after those cuts would be reflected in the normal PAYE tables.

The government wants them to have the benefit for Christmas and for their annual holidays, and it is only the tactics of the opposition in the Senate which is putting this matter at risk.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. What action is being taken to assist the export of food produce from Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1492" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HOTHAM" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I can say that the government has done much and will continue to do more. I would remind the House that food exports from this country currently contribute $12 billion to our export earnings. Australia is by far a net food exporter. The significant change in the composition of our food exports should be noted. Last year, almost one quarter of our food exports were represented by high value added processed food. In other words, we are moving away from just the supplying of commodities as food to doing something with them before they leave this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a strategy to treble the high value food process exports from this country by the year 2000. I point out that trebling the food exports in the high value processed food sector has a significance for this economy because at the moment off the base of $3 billion in high value added food process we have an industry employing 160,000 people. The food processing industry in this country is currently the largest manufacturing segment in our economy. If we are going to treble that base, not only is it good for our balance of payments but it is also great for jobs and terrific for regional development, because the activity will take place near to the source.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the government has developed a strategy by which it will realise this potential. My colleague the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development and I jointly chair the Agrifood Policy Council that is seeing this strategy through. That $3 billion in processed food exports has really increased by $1 billion over the last two years. It took us eight years to complete the previous increase of $1 billion. Not only has the composition of food processing changed but also the rate of change has increased, and some very important recent examples indicate that this trend will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the Prime Minister and I visited Tasmania where the Edgell food company is committed to a potato chip factory, which has the potential to realise $100 million in food exports. It has combined with the world best practices program that we announced during the election campaign and delivered in this budget&mdash;a program that was ridiculed by the opposition as being meaningless to growers but which has been welcomed by the Tasmanian potato growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mars food company in Ballarat has moved to continuous production because it secured an export contract to the former Soviet Union by building on Australia's strength in dairy production. Apple juice from Tasmania, because of its concentration on quality, recently secured a huge contract into Japan, as has the Atlantic salmon industry in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, Goodman Fielder Wattie announced a breakthrough in a high fibre starch component which will add nutrition and health to the food we export, which will underpin the basis upon which we want to expand this industry by tapping into the fact that the world knows Australia is a producer of quality nutritional food. We will secure those export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The common thread to how we have achieved the development of this strategy is that we have built upon our agricultural base; we have sought to do more with the food that is produced than just sell it in domestic markets; we have combined it with the innovative capacity of the nation; and we have developed marketing strategies. The government has had an active role in all of this, either in bringing the linkages in the chain together or putting them in touch with programs that we have developed in their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the opposition would not persist with those programs.

I will try to explain it simply for them now. What the government did in this recent budget was to more than double its estimates of money to be provided under the rural adjustment scheme over the next four years. That is not an insubstantial commitment, I might add. The previous forward estimates said that, for the next four years, we would have had something in the order of $200 million.

We review on a six-monthly basis the adequacy of funding under RAS. If we find that more money is needed under the normal RAS, it will be forthcoming.

Yet, they are the ones that administer the scheme, and they are always the ones complaining that not enough money is available. Not only will I make sure that adequate funds are available; I will make sure that the states pay their way, because I am about ensuring that those farmers who need assistance will get it.

As there has been confusion about the figures involved and the governments' commitments, I am very pleased to announce that the federal government will provide 50 per cent of the funding needed to meet the projected shortfall of the Paralympics. I am very pleased that that has the support, I hope, of both sides of parliament.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales government has announced today that it will meet the other 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Paralympics budget states that the shortfall will amount to about $50 million, and today's announcement means that the federal government agrees to fund up to $25 million of that shortfall over the next seven years. Both governments are confident that the Paralympics will exceed their relatively modest fundraising targets and we hope, therefore, reduce the final amount to be supplied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still a number of other issues outstanding that need to be resolved. These include things such as the structure of the administration. However, I am sure that this announcement of the funding will ensure a very successful Paralympics, and one we can all be proud of.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and note his strong interest as chairman of the industry committee in relation to these issues. Preconditions for a sufficiently high level of business confidence include outcomes such as historically low interest rates, low labour costs by international comparison, historically low levels of inflation, a very competitive taxation and investment regime, industrial relations harmony, and so on. But these are only preconditions. Business confidence, as all members of the House would concede, can be a very elusive thing. We have seen in the last little while, however&mdash;and there is no doubt as we have seen this evidenced in a whole range of surveys and by a range of official statistics and increasingly by anecdotal evidence, of which I am sure all members of this House would be aware&mdash;a clear increase in the levels of business confidence in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

Some key results of that survey were that production orders and sale indices are positive and are expected to increase in the December quarter, and that firms have been consistently updating their equipment over the last couple of years and are well placed to utilise spare capacity to meet the expected upturn.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I table report No. 65 of the Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Collective investment: other people's money</EMPHASIS>. This report completes the terms of reference given to the review by my predecessor, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), in May 1991. An earlier report concentrating on superannuation funds was published in April 1992. That report made a significant contribution to the government's proposals for the regulation of the superannuation industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to thank the members of the review for their work in the preparation of the report. The report provides a comprehensive blueprint for the regulation of the collective investments industry. That industry has attracted, and will continue to attract, a substantial proportion of Australian household and corporate investments. Investments in unit trusts alone grew from $2 billion in 1980 to over $38 billion in 1992. The collective investments industry is rivalling the banking industry as the place where Australians want to invest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of the collective investments industry in the Australian economy underscores the need for an effective and efficient regulatory regime which both encourages business activity and ensures that investors are adequately protected. The recent Fitzgerald report highlighted Australia's national savings challenge. The collective investments industry will play a key role in meeting that challenge. But it will reach its full potential only under an effective and efficient regulatory regime that strikes the right balance between the efficient fundraising for business and providing effective protection for investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations of the review question the continued relevance of some of the existing features of the current regulation of prescribed interest schemes. The principal recommendation of the review is that each collective investment scheme should have a `responsible entity' which would be solely responsible to investors for the conduct of the scheme. This was seen by the review as necessary to remove the doubts and uncertainties that currently exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review's recommendations include the removal of the current requirement for a collective investment scheme to have both a manager and an independent trustee, and the introduction of specific rules for the buyback of investment units held in collective investment schemes. The review recommends that responsibility for schemes should vest in the scheme operator which must establish appropriate compliance measures. Those measures could include the appointment of a third party to hold scheme assets or to assist with scheme management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other major recommendations to enhance regulation of collective investment schemes include: the introduction of a licensing regime for operators; increasing the level of disclosure to investors; increasing the obligations of intermediaries that advise investors; and increasing the powers of the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will carefully consider the views of all interested parties on the recommendations. Efficiency and investor protection must be fundamental to any changes to the system of regulation for collective investment schemes and I still have an open mind on how best to achieve those two goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will be placing a high priority on the development of an appropriate regulatory regime which takes account of the increasing importance of collective investments as vehicles for household savings and retirement incomes. The recommendations deal with issues which are fundamental to government policies on retirement incomes and securities market regulation. The government response will be made only after detailed consideration and further consultation with key industry groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I also want to emphasise from the outset that any changes to the law resulting from that consideration and consultation will have only a prospective application.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The opposition welcomes the report of the Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Collective investment schemes: other people's money</EMPHASIS>. Collective investments include unit trusts, cash management trusts, equity trusts, property trusts and what are known as enterprise schemes, whereby investors pool funds to purchase various assets for one reason or another&mdash;maybe a racehorse, or a holiday home which they share on a time basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the report of the Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee notes, these investments have been particularly popular over recent years. Investments in unit trusts alone grew from less than $2 billion in 1980 to over $38 billion in 1992. The report notes, however, that in relation to such investment schemes we are dealing with three different kinds of risks; that is the investment or market risk, the risk that the investment will decline in value; the institutional risk, the risk that the institution which operates the scheme will collapse; and the compliance risk, the risk that managers and others associated with the schemes will not follow the rules that are set out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to investment or market risk, although we would like all investors to share profits at all times, it is not something that can be fully dealt with by regulation. If regulation were to rule out the possibility of a loss on an investment, the probabilities are that it would rule out the possibility of a profit too. Investors in collective schemes, like investors in other sorts of schemes, must always take that investment risk. In relation to institutional risk, anybody who takes money from the public, invests it and undertakes obligations to investors should have some capital adequacy behind them&mdash;an adequacy that will provide for those who have rights or remedies the opportunity to enforce them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommends five per cent of total assets under management as a capital adequacy in relation to such schemes. Interestingly, it does not recommend a minimum liquidity requirement for any of the schemes. That, no doubt,  will be something that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) will closely look at. The third area of risk is the compliance risk. Compliance with regulations is designed to prevent investors losing money but, on some occasions, particularly in relation to this industry, compliance with the regulator's rules actually exposed investors. This industry is a classic case of where government regulation actually increased risk for those who are investing in these sorts of products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government regulation required managers to buy from unit holders their interests upon request. This contributed to problems in unlisted property trusts which led to the government freezing redemptions in 1991. Property trusts were investing long in property but were required by regulation to borrow short and to undertake to buy back unit holders upon request when they so sought it. Having invested long, they were unable to buy back short when they were requested to do so in large volumes. This led to a run on some of those trusts in the eventual freezing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important, therefore, not to just regulate but to regulate in the right way, because regulation can, in some cases, increase risk. The report recommends that existing statutory buyback obligations should be repealed. The controversial part of the report, I suspect, will be dealing with the way in which collective investments are managed in the future. At present, we have managers who are required to hold securities dealers licences which establish, promote and operate collective investments and also trustees who must be approved by the Australian Securities Commission. Trustees under trustees law are required to look after the interests of the beneficiaries or the unit holders. They are there not so much to worry about the investment and the maximisation of profits but to worry about the safety of those who have invested their money and who are beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes that this split of responsibilities has led, in some cases, to a confusion of roles. It is not entirely clear in each circumstance how the two powers interrelate. There may be circumstances where that confusion has undermined protection for beneficiaries. The answer to that may well be to make it clear what the different roles are, to separate them and to give clear guidance as to the way in which they would be exercised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not automatically apparent that if protection has not been sufficient with the two functions being performed separately it will necessarily be better if it is performed by only one. The report recommends one entity, a scheme operator, responsible for all aspects of the scheme's compliance. There may well be a confusion of roles if the one organisation, the scheme operator, is required, on the one hand, to maximise profit for the investors but, on the other hand, to ensure that they are properly protected in relation to their legal rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that was brought down by the Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee obviously came to the conclusion that one entity would be better. But this, no doubt, will be hotly contested, particularly by those who are in the trustee industry. I note that the Attorney-General has undertaken to consult. We welcome that. We believe that he should be consulting very thoroughly indeed with those who are in the trustee industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For our own part, we think that there may well be something in having two entities with distinct roles, but we are also open to persuasion on that particular issue. The coalition will be taking extensive advice on that particular matter and will be discussing the matter with the trustee industry before coming to a final conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, nothing is more important for people who are investing than to know that they are being protected against fraud or illegality, and to know that subject to investment risk their assets will be properly managed. If we as a country want to boost savings by encouraging people to set aside money it is of the utmost importance that a scheme be established that protects those people against the sharks and against unnecessary risk, so that they can go about investing in their own future and the future of the nation in a way which is reliable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that now more than at any time in recent years the Australian community wants economic and community growth, but it wants growth with stability. We now have growth after coming out of a severe recession. The standards for measuring growth have been very clearly outlined and, by international standards, ours is quite consistently high. We are above the OECD average. Growth in Australia is expected to be 2.9 per cent in 1993 and 3.1 per cent in 1994, compared with the OECD average of 1.2 per cent for 1993 and 2.7 per cent for 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some respects, unfortunately, we do not have the incredibly rapid rate of growth of some of our neighbours to the north&mdash;the Asian tigers as they are often termed&mdash;but, of course, there are reasons for that. By the same token, very few of those countries have anything like the social systems of protection for their communities that we in Australia have. It will probably be many years before even the most powerful countries can achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment in Australia is expected to grow by about 0.7 per cent in 1993 and 1.4 per cent in 1994 while the labour market in the OECD, which consists essentially of non-Asian countries, is expected to experience a further decline in 1993 of 0.1 per cent before returning to slow growth in 1994 of 0.9 per cent. Conditions in Europe will be weaker than in the rest of the OECD, while the USA and Japan are in fact expected to consolidate growth in 1993 and improve further in 1994. Among the major OECD countries, Canada, the United States, Japan and Australia are expected to record the best output in employment growth in the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all searching for solutions. We are all searching for the reasons why our economies, and the world economy, are in a relatively precarious or, certainly for many people, a dangerous state. I do not think we have to look too far outside Australia to see some of the reasons. I believe that the changes in eastern Europe have added dramatically to the inability of governments of the world to respond effectively to that which would have been dealt with almost by the economic cycle that seems to come around every seven to 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of the decline of the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc powers has had a number of effects. It has affected defence spending, and that is obviously a good thing. The peace dividend is often talked about. We have seen some of the outcomes of that in this budget. But on a world scale it has created many problems in countries that we trade with. The decline in defence spending has had an impact on local communities and on defence procurement and production. Anyone who has been to Europe would have seen the power of the armies of Europe, whether it be Warsaw Pact or NATO forces. All those things have had drastic effects on a number of the major economies that we trade with.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, in the long term, that will be incredibly beneficial on a scale the world has not yet seen or recognised, but at this stage I believe it is having a major effect on world demand and employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, our trade is affected. By the same token, there is a problem for many countries in eastern Europe in that there is now a vastly increased labour market or world labour force due to the breaking down of the Iron Curtain boundaries. That is having an effect in western Europe, creating a great surplus of labour. Whole new labour markets are opening up which will have an impact on us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we are looking for growth. As I have already indicated, we are well on target. We are likely to reach growth and surpass the average of other countries that we generally compare ourselves with. We need growth with stability, because what is clearly affecting us more than anything else at the moment&mdash;particularly in this period of the economic cycle&mdash;is the need for economic confidence and confidence in our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The instability created by the opposition in this House and in the other house regarding the passage of this budget is doing this country immense damage. Members of the opposition now have the opportunity to signal very clearly to the other house and to all Australians that they accept that they lost the 1993 election. I understand that it would be very hard for them to accept that because they really believed, as did many others, that they had it won. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March this year the Australian people very firmly rejected their policies for very good reasons. They rejected the GST, the changes that were being proposed to Medicare, the industrial relations policies&mdash;in fact, they rejected Fightback in toto. The Australian people said no because they wanted stability. They did not want the disruption that would result from the types of policies that the opposition would put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not, as has been spread by some of the opposition's apologists, as a result of fear campaigns; it was because people did not want that sort of instability. They did not want the sorts of changes they were told about at that time pushed upon them, let alone the ones that they were not told about. That is something that the opposition has to come to terms with. I do not believe it has come to terms with it. We only have to see the fits of pique from the opposition that go on in this place and that are reported in the media from time to time, particularly regarding the issues surrounding the tax bills, wholesale tax and indirect taxes. If it were just their egos that would be their problem. But the problem is that it is having a very great destabilising effect on our national confidence and our economic confidence, which is being reflected in many ways on a day-to-day basis, often on an hour-by-hour basis, particularly in relation to the situation pertaining to the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Liberal and National parties are not the only ones who should bear the blame. The Greens in the other place have to look seriously at what they want to achieve and at what they are now imposing on the Australian economy and the Australian people, despite what they say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this issue is not resolved very quickly by these two people, as well as the leadership that should be shown by the opposition, then this country will not only be inhibited and restricted in the way in which it can resolve its economic problems; it will also be restricted in the way in which it is able to take advantage of the opportunities presented to it domestically and in the Asia-Pacific region. More and more people are becoming aware of the importance of that region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has spoken about the Asia-Pacific region and APEC, and we have seen support for the Prime Minister coming from the President of the United States in the last week or so. We are beginning to understand far better our place in the world. For once in our history we are geographically located in the best place. The Olympic Games in the year 2000 and all that entails will have a potential, positive impact, despite the kerfuffle that the opposition would like to make from time to time regarding the flag and other relatively peripheral issues. We have an opportunity which we must grasp now. We must take the opportunity to capitalise on the confidence and the position of this country and do something about Australia's biggest problem, that of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not particularly happy with some elements in this budget, most of which have been addressed. It is understood by members of any political party that, in any government budget, document or policy direction, you win some and lose some. But, when the decision has been made, you get on with the job. Nothing that I or other people in the community might be concerned about in this budget compares in any way whatsoever with what the opposition would have dished up had it been on this side of the House at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition can take no succour from any events which may have occurred in our party room over the last few weeks. What has transpired in our party room is a sign of strength, not weakness. It is a sign of vibrancy and vitality and not decay, which is symptomatic of those opposite. The opposition in this country is effectively in decay. It has no identity as a party and, after the last election, it has no policies left. The opposition is unsure of where to go. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is obviously a lame duck, a temporary leader. He is a caretaker because the opposition cannot work out its identity and where it is going. In fact, the opposition has no principles&mdash;it has not even been able to define the principles that would take it into an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the opposition may derive some succour from what the opinion polls indicate at the moment, the reality is that if an election were held tomorrow, because the people of Australia want growth, stability and confidence in their government, they would not be prepared to support or in any way entertain an opposition&mdash;or an opposition leader&mdash;which has not been able to articulate clearly the policies the people want. The government is having problems dealing with the opposition over the budget both here and in the other place. My advice to the opposition is to put the election behind it. The electorate will see it in a better light if it does that. The opposition has to come to terms with that, go out and develop policy, work out what it is really about and make itself relevant because people will not vote for any party unless it is relevant to their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this budget people have seen a response&mdash;despite what they may have felt about a number of decisions which, mainly, have been revised. If we look through the budget we see that more than 100 election commitments have been honoured&mdash;either in this budget, or have been factored into budgets through to 1996-97. Those things that the Australian people wanted from the government at the last election have been provided through well over 100 commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When media commentators&mdash;those people on incomes of $1 million a year who have never had to take a tough decision in their lives and who just sit there and pontificate and mouth off editorial opinions every day to millions of Australians&mdash;talk about the promises of politicians, let them for once talk about the 100 or so commitments in this budget that were given at the last election and which this government has now put into policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those commitments include: the child-care cash rebate for working parents; reducing the excessive waiting times for elective surgery; the Commonwealth dental program for health card holders; palliative care funding; child-care initiatives for sick children; funding for play groups; national accreditation for child-care centres; extension of long day care child-care assistance fee relief to occasional child care; development and distribution of public patients hospital charter; Medicare rebate for bone densitometry; a catch-up immunisation program against HIB disease for children; dealing with overservicing and fraud in Medicare&mdash;now something on which the AMA is prepared to work with the government; expansion in work related child-care places; expansion of the women's health program; simplification of waiting period waiver provisions for social security; increased earned income allowance in income test free areas; earnings credits; reduced assets test withdrawal rate for pensioners; and on it goes. These are the things which mean something to Australians on a day-to-day basis. Australians want a strong health system. They want industrial relations which give them a role in a system in which they can have some security. Australians want growth with stability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's attitude to the budget both here and in the other place is adding to this country's debt burden. The more that opposition members by their actions drive the dollar down and inhibit investment and confidence in this country, the more they add to the economic difficulties which we will subsequently have to overcome. If they are really serious, it is no good their coming in here everyday and talking about unemployment and the fact that one million people are unemployed. Those are things that everyone in this House is&mdash;and should be, justifiably&mdash;extremely concerned about. It is no good their coming in here and talking about it in a fit of pique, because of their dented egos. They all expected to be in the ministerial wing. Opposition members were all cruising around there a couple of days before the election, picking out the offices with the best view. They had organised all that well and truly before time. We saw that shortly afterwards. </PARA>

Of course, that fell through. Those sorts of things are peripheral; but the point is that the opposition has to come to terms with the fact that it is increasing unemployment in this country. It might be a hard thing for it to swallow, but by its actions in this House and the other place, it is in fact increasing unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has done a lot to minimise the impact of the recession regarding unemployment, and set Australia up for the growth which is already shown to be higher than in other OECD countries. We have record low inflation&mdash;the lowest for 30 years. We have one of the highest growth rate prospects in the OECD, which I have already highlighted. We have record low interest rates. We have a world competitive business tax system, with a fall in the company tax rate from 39c to 33c in the dollar, whereas the opposition would put it up to 42c in the dollar. We have a reduction in personal income taxes, which the opposition is now trying to stymie. We have special incentives to invest. We have industrial stability&mdash;again, we have the lowest number of industrial disputes for 30 years. We have improved international competitiveness. We have low levels of public sector debt by any international standard, and high and increasing levels of profit share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are new measures in this budget which go to stimulating investment and employment in this country, which the opposition, by its tactics and by its dented egos, is seeking to inhibit. We have new measures which bring forward the tax cuts; a strategy which builds on the savings of the nation; a strategy to reduce the public sector's call on national savings by reducing the budget deficit. Indeed, $94 million is allocated to encourage more small to medium sized firms to commence or intensify exports. I have any number of classic examples of companies that are not McKinsey sized, but at a smaller level, which will be the driving force not only of employment, but of innovation and growth, and which will affect Australia's stance in a very important part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government's white paper on employment will be something which all Australians need to understand and participate in. I commend the work of the caucus committees in terms of employment, and in terms of regional development, where employment really will be the force and where opportunities will exist for creating growth with stability, which the opposition will deny this country. </PARA>

<PARA>That says it all. The government claims to have embarked on a strategy for creating jobs; it is all about jobs. But I took the time and trouble to write to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) to find out what the government was going to do about unemployment. The response was quite staggering. In my electorate I have 7,500 people receiving unemployment benefits. The government, through the minister, wrote back and said that it was going to appoint yet another committee to look at unemployment, and that the committee would be set up and come back with a white paper in the first half of 1994. We are talking about a budget which was introduced early in August, and we are now looking at having a white paper prepared by some time in 1994. That means that for at least six months the government will have taken no action at all on unemployment queues. More likely than not, it will be 12 months before we see that white paper and any implementation of any action on unemployment in this country. So we are looking almost at August-September, maybe October-November, of 1994 before we see any action at all on jobs. </PARA>

It decided in this year's budget to increase the tax on wine from 20 per cent to 31 per cent&mdash;a 55 per cent increase&mdash;on what is one of this nation's emerging export industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to put that decision in the context of the government's 1993 election promises. The government promised that there would be no GST and more jobs&mdash;I can still hear that theme ringing out&mdash;but we ended up with wholesale sales tax increases and fewer jobs. There was not even a genuine attempt by the government to address the unemployment situation for at least 12 months. So there has been no attempt at all to address the question of about 11 per cent national unemployment. Certainly the minister for employment has done nothing except appoint another committee which will report back to him with a green paper some time late in 1994. That really is an indictment on this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the backbench members of caucus staged a revolt over this budget because, as we were told, the main focal point of the budget bill was jobs and where those jobs would emerge from. The government said it could do that without increasing taxes and without a GST, but it increased the wholesale sales tax and the result of that will be fewer jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of Australia's most important export industries is primary production. What did the government do to primary producers? In this budget it increased the excise on petroleum products by a flat 3c a litre from the night of the budget to be followed by an extra 2c a litre in a year's time, applying an additional increase of 1c per litre on leaded fuel, rising 5c a litre in a year's time. The government's response will be that the farmers get a rebate on their diesel fuel, but the government is still not missing out because it has established a rebate administration fee which will raise $10 million purely and simply to administer the rebate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From figures I have been given I understand that the administration cost of that diesel rebate scheme will be something less than $5 million, so the government will reap a very healthy profit. It will raise $10 million in administration fees from an industry of the very type that it is supposedly encouraging&mdash;an export industry&mdash;and from people who are producing primary produce for world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the government has done for the industry is to increase the cost of transport in every form by imposing an increased fuel excise. That increase will flow on to all of the industries that service the rural community and the primary producers in this land. All transport costs will go up and the flow-on effect to the primary industry sector will be enormous. That only serves to make our primary produce less competitive in world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some very good markets overseas&mdash;or we did have. We are having some battles to retain them now because of the influence of things such as the export enhancement program of the United States. Australia has always produced good clean food at a very competitive price, but the government has now saddled the industry with these increased excises on petroleum products, and that adds a cost to every item of equipment and every service that touches on the rural community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that the back bench and the caucus of the government had had great difficulties with this budget as well. They went back to the electorates, and they heard the same message as I heard, and obviously came across the same feelings as Ethel Watson from Kangaroo Flat has expressed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bendigo Advertiser</EMPHASIS> this morning. She recognises the problems that this budget is creating. I do not know how the backbench members of the Labor Party could have gone back and faced their electorates. Obviously they received a tremendous caning in their electorates, because they had to come back here and there was an unholy squabble. The backbench members turned up at the expenditure review committee meeting and they got some minor concessions, but they did not really address the real problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problems are the one million people who are unemployed in this country, and the encouragement of Australian export industries to enable them to get into a situation where they can compete overseas, because that is where the growth will come from. There has to be encouragement of the private sector, and encouragement of firms who are prepared to have a go on world export markets. They must be encouraged to employ people and push into South-East Asia and other areas where they can get export industries going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that came out of the budget was the arrogance and lack of consultation shown by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) towards people in their own party. It is quite obvious from this side of the chamber that there was no consultation with the government's backbench members. The backbench members did not have any input at all into the budget processes. When the budget was released, the backbench members were placed in the very embarrassing situation of having to go back to their electorates and try to explain it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no possible way it could be explained to the wine industry; an industry that is developing rapidly and that has great potential for Australia. The backbench members of the Labor Party obviously were not able to explain the budget to their own constituents, so they had to come back and try to wring out some tiny little concessions. They did not have a great deal of success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give the House some figures to illustrate how this budget will affect people in my electorate. More than 80 per cent of Bendigo families will be worse off under this budget. The figures produced by the Department of the Treasury&mdash;they are not my figures&mdash;reveal that a family earning $25,000 a year will be 1.5 per cent worse off, while Australians earning between $45,000 to $60,000 per year are the big winners from this budget. A single person earning $25,000 a year will be 1.1 per cent worse off following the tax increases which the Treasurer announced in the budget. According to the Treasury figures, pensioners and the one million people who are unemployed will be 0.8 per cent worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget strikes right at the heart of the Bendigo electorate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first tax measure that we are opposing is the retrospective increase in tax on unused accrued annual leave. I bet my bottom dollar that Labor Party members cop plenty of flak over that. Yet the government is still not backing away from it. The second is the increase in wholesale sales taxes. We see it as being to the detriment of the economic recovery of Australia. It is a massive increase in wholesale sales tax over a range of hundreds, maybe thousands, of products, as proposed in the measures outlined by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third measure is the increase in the tax on wine. The Australian wine industry is emerging as a very good export dollar earner and should be encouraged. The fourth decision was to oppose the increase in tax on petrol, diesel and other fuels, as that affects another very substantial export earner in the primary industry sector. The flow-on impact from that on the whole transport industry would act against the best interests of exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have noticed that the government is trying to shy away from its terrible budget and push the blame for it onto the coalition and other parties. The government is bogged down by the most dreadful decisions that it has taken as a result of these budget measures. Members on the Labor side of the House must have great difficulty in explaining to their constituents&mdash;particularly people who are still driving vehicles that use leaded fuel and people in the transport industry who are transporting goods from one part of the country to another&mdash;how they could agree to impose that increased excise on fuel. It is fine for people to talk about the replacement of vehicles that use leaded fuel, but that is well beyond many people. They cannot find the $10,000 or $15,000 necessary to change that vehicle over and they are really feeling the effects of this budget. </PARA>

We can look back to the real problem of this administration, which rests with the failure of the then Treasurer, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to carry his reforms&mdash;in regard to a general GST&mdash;in the early days of the Hawke administration.

So instead of helping members of the community, it is depriving them of further productive capacity by raising costs. Its problems with the Senate are of its own making. It was adequately warned, when it reformed the method of electing senators, of what the consequences would be for the government of the day. When it raised the numbers in the Senate from 10 to 12, it created an election for even numbers in the Senate. It consolidated the inevitability that the government of the day would not carry the numbers or have a majority to approve its programs in the Senate. </PARA>

The biggest question facing Premier Arnold in South Australia, it would seem, is when should he fix the election date to maximise his possibility of return? When the election will be called interests members of the South Australian public. They want it to occur at the earliest possible time.

<PARA>Mr Peter Ward, a highly regarded writer in South Australia, recently published an article under the heading `Bonfire of the Vanities'. His original article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By State per capita, the debacle is the largest in Australian banking history. When the Victorian State Bank went down in 1990, crippled by an estimated $3 billion loss and the collapse of its Tricontinental finance arm, the cost was in the order of $907 for every Victorian. In South Australia, the State Bank's $3.15 billion shortfall is $2085 a head.</PARA>
<PARA>The question was posed: why did this occur? The public and all of us want to know why. I refer to an article about the deal of the Remm project in Rundle Street in Adelaide, where finance of $550 million went into a now drastically revalued property deal. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About this deal and Bannon's participation the royal commission was particularly crisp.

<PARA>But after all these problems, and after the bank was revealed for what it was&mdash;the adventurous piratical organisation&mdash;an article states:</PARA>

Yet, in the latter 1980s and in the early 1990s, the state Treasury was ignorant of the depletion of the prospects of the State Bank. It did not know what was going on and, if it did, it would be utterly culpable in not making sure that the premier of the day knew about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state Treasury, through all of this grand debacle and disaster, which has struck my state and which will inhibit its capacity to develop for years to come, was culpable in some way of negligence on a grand scale of not knowing what was happening to the greatest financial institution in my state.

The budget provides substantial support for business investment through investment allowances, lowering the company tax rate from 39c in the dollar to 33c and extending the depreciation and development allowances announced in the One Nation package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will provide a healthy climate for investment confidence, business growth and employment opportunities. These measures should result in an increase in business investment of close to 11 per cent, with an employment increase of about 100,000 in the coming year. Next year the employment growth is forecast at 2 1/2 per cent and the following year, 1994-95, it is forecast to be 2 3/4 per cent. </PARA>

The government is also providing pension-type benefits for unemployed people over 60 years of age in recognition of the difficulty that this group faces in getting full-time employment. These initiatives demonstrate that this government has a real concern for the unemployed and will not let them fall by the wayside to become a mass underclass, as proposed by the coalition's social welfare policies. </PARA>

Over the life of this government we have increased the number of child-care places from 46,000 to more than 200,000, with an increase in the expenditure commitment from $65 million to $640 million. The government has made a commitment to fully meet the demand for work related child care by the year 2001 with an interim target of 300,000 places by 1996-97. This budget provides funding for an estimated 29,000 additional places in 1993-94. </PARA>

He has no interest in people, but only an interest in playing those low political games, regardless of whom it hurts or how much damage it does to the Australian economy. I know what the result of budget intransigence from the opposition could mean, and we have heard this from the Governor of the Reserve Bank; it could mean a lower dollar and higher interest rates, interest rate increases that would be a much bigger blow to the battlers of the country and to business in the country than any of the revenue raising measures in the budget. </PARA>

Why are they so small-thinking that they see so narrowly that they can only use their balance of power to become lackeys of the conservatives?

Sooner or later the grassroots support will see through this. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many on the other side of this House believe, incorrectly, that protection of the environment is anathema to economic prosperity. The underlying notion is entrenched in their minds that in order to prosper economically we need development at all costs, regardless of consequences; that we need to extract more and more from our finite resources. There is always a failure by the opposition to recognise that resources are finite and that, if we continue to plunder these resources in the hope of gaining economic prosperity, there will be nothing left. </PARA>

This is a reputation that we need to maintain and enhance. If Australia can, through imaginative policies, satisfy what will be enormous world demand for food that is perceived and can be demonstrated to be clean and green, the world will demand those products. The world is becoming health conscious and will pay a premium for products produced in a non-polluting, environmentally conscious way. </PARA>

The jobskills program offers six months work experience and training places to the long-term unemployed and is targeted to the regions of highest unemployment. In my electorate the Greening Australia program has made provision for 260 jobskills placements. They will provide on-the-ground land management training in conjunction with a reafforestation program which will form the basis for a sustainable timber production industry on the New South Wales north coast.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to concentrate on one aspect of these matters in this Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1993-94 this afternoon and that is the aspect of the effect of increased taxes on the wine industry. This government in this budget has put up its own government expenditure and put taxes on other industries to pay for it. Therefore, for government members to come in here, as has been going on in the last few days, and protest about the savage and unfortunate Christmases that Australians will have, when the government in fact is guilty of the very reason for that coming to pass, is nothing less than hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of wine, the question is, `What would you do in Australia if you were a government which professes to want to promote industry?'. We have heard the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) in this place again today saying that exports are the name of the game; that what we have to do is get out there and become part of the world scene in a way that makes sure that Australia can go forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government looks around for an industry and finds one which has been struggling along for 100 years. It finds one that is starting to improve&mdash;that is starting to make not only an acceptable product for home consumption, which it did for a number of years, but one which is now acceptable to the rest of the world. It has had some local product success and it is an expanding industry. It has dared to venture out into the world, which I might say many of our industries until recently have not. It has lots of small business entrepreneurs involved in it. It has some 6,000 grape growers, and many employees involved in it. The government finds out whether the industry has succeeded and whether it is making market penetration. It finds out whether the technology in that industry is now acceptable to the rest of the world. It finds an industry which people, even French wine makers, are now saying has technology as good as that anywhere else in the world, if not the best technology in the world. When it has found out all of those things and made sure that that industry is rapidly expanding its exports then it taxes it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry had no sales tax until 1984. On 21 August 1984, with the exception of wine with a low alcoholic content, a 10 per cent sales tax was applied to wine. That caused great consternation around Australia because at that stage the wine industry was not exactly in its infancy but it was an industry that was still learning and had a long way to go to get to world standards. In 1986, the wholesale sales tax went up to 20 per cent, and in 1993 this government is trying to take the wholesale sales tax to 31 per cent on wine and then subsequently to 32 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a great interest in this industry because I have seen the development of it, not only in my electorate but also in my state and in the Hunter River, and of latter days in rather newer areas in Victoria. I have watched the sorts of people who have taken the trouble to train themselves, who have taken the trouble to attend schools of oenology and other places and taken the trouble to go to the nether ends of the earth to become technically expert. I have watched them struggle with their small plots of land, I have watched some of them expand and I have watched those people succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was absolutely horrified when I heard the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) say on budget night that the government was going to increase the tax on the wine industry. Not only was I horrified but I found that I was in keeping with a whole lot of other people in Australia. The coalition decided that this budget was so outrageous that it had to pick a number of taxes with which it totally disapproved, object to them and vote against them. This was one of the taxes which we chose to object to for the very best of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) has come to the table because he knows these only too well, not only because he enjoys the product but also because lots of people produce it in his own electorate. I am absolutely staggered that the minister did not have some influence on this decision before it was made. Of course, the reason he had no influence on the decision before it was made was that he did not know it was going to be made. He did not know it was going to be made in the same way as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) did not know until, I understand, 6.30 on budget night that the decision was going to be made to increase the sales tax on wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great way, is it not, Mr Deputy Speaker, to encourage industries when the minister responsible for that industry has no idea that the taxes are going to be increased. One can imagine how well thought out the whole matter was. In the same way, the same minister did not even know that there was going to be an increased levy on wool in the budget papers to begin on 1 July 1994. So there are a lot of things that these ministers do not seem to know about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one of the things that is absolutely sure is that development and investment in that industry will slow down&mdash;but not stop&mdash;as a result of an increase of this sort in the wine tax. So I cannot for the life of me understand how that was allowed to come to pass. Of course, there is no logic in it. It has been allowed to come to pass because the government needed the money from somewhere and it may as well go out and get it from an industry which looks to be successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the other argument in this matter is that the beer industry is heavily taxed. There is no doubt it is heavily taxed; it has been heavily taxed for years. Having been involved in that industry on the board of a company, I had listened for years to that industry putting submissions to government about the fact that there should be more wine taxes. I disagreed with those submissions every time because my argument used to be that if there were a tax on beer and then a tax on wine, one would be ramped by some government or another and it would be used as a series of step ladders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly what happened. We had the beer lobby up here in Canberra, twisting everybody's arm, saying, `Look how much money we are paying. Why don't you make other people pay the same sort of offering?'. But it is nonsense. Just because one industry is used as a general taxing method for revenue, that does not mean to say that other industries should be taxed also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry has long lead times in which, depending on the particular geographical area, the plantings take three, four or even five years, on some occasions, to come to reasonable fruition and it takes at least a couple of years to get it into the bottle for export. It is quite unreasonable to tax those sorts of industries which have those sorts of lead times&mdash;and, I might say, which involve those sorts of entrepreneurial activities&mdash;in the same way as one taxes an industry that puts various ingredients in one side of a machine which come out the other end a few days or weeks later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I found it an unbelievable circumstance that all of those people who had got so enthusiastic about an industry that was starting to succeed should be taxed. And I say advisedly `starting to succeed', because all the hyperbole about the fact that this is a very successful and financially rewarding industry is complete nonsense. One has only to read the annual general reports of the larger companies, and of some of the smaller ones, and talk to the wine growing fraternity itself to know that that has not been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to encourage people in this country to create jobs, we will have to make sure that they feel confident that the future of the industry in which they partake will give them a reward. We know that jobs are created by small industries; they are not created, in the main, by the BHPs or the Mount Isa Mines. What is tending to happen in those bigger organisations these days is that they can produce the same quantity of goods with a lesser number of people. The reason for that is quite obvious. The technological improvements enable them to spend money on capital equipment which does the same thing as people used to do before it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this expanding industry requires people. It requires people to plant. It requires people to graft. It requires people to harvest the posts. It requires people to grow the posts. It requires people to treat the posts. It requires people to do all sorts of things that require labour. It requires people to harvest. It requires people to spray. It requires people to design the wineries. It requires people to design the restaurants that grow out of the wineries. It requires people to do all sorts of things which create jobs. It also creates new areas of tourism for national and international tourists. One has only to take perhaps the most internationally famous area of Australian grape growing, Coonawarra&mdash;more famous, I have to say, than McLaren Vale at the present time&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 15 years, that area has changed from being simply a grape growing strip of terra rossa soil to having restaurants, hotels and international visitors coming from all over the world, including places like Sweden, to buy their main Australian wine requirements. Sweden is second only to the UK as the biggest receiver of Australian wine in the world. Tourists come to those places and new industries are created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot imagine an industry that is better at creating small business and small jobs than the wine industry. It creates other industries. Therefore, to tax it is an act of madness which is second to none. The minister ought to know that better than anyone else. In fact, he ought to be more embarrassed about this than anybody in the whole country on the government side of politics, and I am sure he is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have got to a situation now where we are seeing a monumental battle between the government and the wine industry on the matter of tax. We read in the paper about deals on the side. The growers have said, as we have said, `We will oppose this tax all the way to the vote'. We will oppose it here in this House, we will oppose it in the Senate and we will oppose it in whatever form for however long it takes to turn up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise this issue because it is an example of a particularly bad decision made by the Treasurer when at the last minute he found he had a shortfall. It was made without consultation with the local members who might have been affected, even on his own side&mdash;he certainly would not consult us&mdash;without consultation with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who knew nothing about it, and without consultation with the industry, or if he did consult the industry he did something quite different from the understandings that the industry had some months before. It is an example of exactly how investment can be can slowed down in an area where one does not want to slow down investment at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I chose this example because it had all the ingredients of a wealth making, job making, entrepreneurial activity which actually created other industries, and the government slowed it down. That is a ridiculous solution in order to raise $79 million a year. I understand that the Managing Director of the South Australian Brewing Co. has said in the past that we need $1 billion of new investment within the foreseeable future. That means that, for the lower south-east area of my state to fulfil its portion of that investment, there must be somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 acres of new plantings every three or four years, at $12,000 an acre&mdash;and that is without the land cost. It will take three or four years for the plantings to come to early fruition and another couple of years to produce the wine. It is no exaggeration to say that, as I drive down the road to the bottom end of South Australia, it seems to me that some of that investment has gone on hold. It seems to me from the conversations I have had that those people who were putting together investment money have been told to cool it until we see what happens to this tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the result of the thinking process of a government that is trying to create jobs, with a 10 or 11 per cent unemployment rate, what hope do we have in this country? We have only to look at this industry to get an idea of the lack of thinking that takes place when the government is preparing its budgets. We have reached a point where our international reputation is such that one of the top winegrowers in France said, `We have two problems left in France: one is the bloody weather and the other is the bloody Australians'. That is a flattering position to be in. We have reached a position where, in markets other than France, even the French are very worried. What do we do? We make sure that investment slows down.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1993-94. On 24 February 1993, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Building on strength</EMPHASIS>, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) emphasised our commitment to an Australia based on practical, sensible policies to stimulate private investment, strengthen economic recovery and increase employment, while at the same time building a fairer Australia. The pursuit of greater social equality, good health care, good education and a good environment for all Australians, remain the policy foundations for the Labor government. These involve measures to stimulate growth by encouraging investment and innovation, increasing women's participation in the work force, improving and extending access to child care, improving health care, assisting older Australians, improving and expanding our education system, and reducing marginal tax rates for middle Australia. These policy foundations were incorporated in the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to see that the primary objective of the 1993 budget is jobs. This is built on a recovery based on low interest rates, continuing low inflation, reduced company tax and generous business investment incentives, designed to cut the deficit by $9 billion in four years, contribute some $17 billion to the national savings over three years and provide extra help to families with children, extra assistance to those out of work, improved health services, and a range of other initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be 500,000 labour market places available this financial year, two-thirds of which will go to people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. Further, the newstart allowance will be increased by $6 per fortnight for single adult people without children who have been unemployed for more than 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget recognised that in 1990-91, $8 billion in export earnings was achieved from 700 small to medium sized manufacturers. More than 6,000 businesses are not yet exporting. A total of $94 million will be provided over the next three years to enable them to provide more jobs by gaining access to export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget provides relief for middle and low income Australians by delivering tax cuts early, commencing when the opposition stops its constitutional vandalism. Those on incomes below $23,200 will receive a new rebate on assessment. These tax initiatives will stimulate the economy by $2 billion. The seniors health card will be provided from 1 July 1994 to low income retirees not currently receiving the pension. The pensions assets test will be eased from September 1993&mdash;this month. Commitment to child care, a major strategy in our election campaign, will be delivered. Overall, this budget is a responsible document by a responsible government committed to social justice and jobs within our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget goes further than just being a responsible document for Australia's future. Let me be specific and list for the record the promises kept, because this budget is all about being honest and being strong in keeping commitments. The opposition made outrageous claims about its so-called Fightback mark 3 package&mdash;the unchangeable. What is it now called: slink-off mark 12&mdash;the impossible? The opposition knows that if it had got into government, it would have done a Jeff Kennett, cried foul on how bad the books really were, and gone back to Fightback mark 1. When that proved to be disastrous, who knows who it would have then blamed. Those opposite know that that was what was planned. Privately, the more honest of them admit it over a few beers. The government made promises and has delivered, and the opposition does not like it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, let me detail the promises kept: establishment of a cultural heritage protection program for Aboriginal rock art; an education and monitoring program concerning taxation incentives for the arts; protection and return of significant cultural property to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; establishment of a festival of youth arts; development of the National Museum of Australia&mdash;design and documentation work for the development of the Yarramundi site; improved access to the distributed national heritage collection; a film script development and producer support program; enhancement of the role of the Australian Youth Orchestra; improvement of children's media; establishment of the Foundation for Australian Cultural Development; national touring of visual arts, crafts and heritage exhibitions; expansion of cultural industry development schemes; a Commonwealth cultural policy statement; and a review of the Australian honours system. </PARA>

These are the things that those opposite put in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are optional postal income assessments for child-care assistance; reduced overservicing and fraud of Medicare; referral services for women escaping domestic violence in rural and remote areas; expansion in work related child-care places; the second national AIDS program strategy; a women's health program; establishment of working women's centres; industrial relations legislation reform and an information campaign; funding for workplace reform and a best practice program; and the implementation of ILO Convention No. 156, involving workers with family responsibilities. These are the things that those people over there put in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are changes in shipbuilding and bounty rates; a regional development task force; and a safety officer for NSW forests. After what the minister in New South Wales is doing, it is no wonder that they need one. Further commitments include encouraging the use of solar water heaters; New South Wales flood mitigation; a review of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation; a review of the wool industry; community based models for rural area development; a rural counselling program; and telecentres for rural communities. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) thinks that this is all ridiculous, and it is ridiculous that he should think it funny that these things will be stopped for his rural voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is additional funding for clean food export strategies; funding for horticulture; a rural enterprise network program; upgrading of rural telecommunications services; a rural development incentive scheme; a world best practice incentive scheme; cooperative research centres; establishment of a republic advisory committee and constitutional reform unit; and continuation of the National Committee on Violence Against Women. Some of the female members of the opposition should think very hard about what that means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the additional funding of the operational grants component of the national agenda for women; the simplification of waiting period waiver provisions; increased earned income allowance in the income test free area; earnings credit for allowance recipients; the transfer of newstart allowance recipients to a mature age allowance for long-term unemployed aged 60 and over but who are under the age to qualify for an age pension; an indexed, non-taxable home child-care allowance in the social security system; a reduced assets test withdrawal rate for pensioners; and a seniors health card. These are the things which the opposition wants to jeopardise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the completion of the survey work on the Alice Springs-Darwin rail link; establishment of a national transport planning task force; an inquiry into the provision of broadband services to customer premises with optic fibre; extension of the ABC's Triple J; development of a national ecotourism strategy and the implementation of an ecotourism program; implementation of a regional tourism development program; development of a special interest tourism program; establishment of a tourism forecasting council; assistance to residents of contaminated sites at the Martin Street subdivision, Armidale; and Commonwealth financial assistance to South Australia&mdash;and the last speaker, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), should think about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other measures include the establishment of a national investment council; an expanded role for the Commonwealth Development Bank; a national Aboriginal and Islander skills development association; the Asia-Pacific biennale of indigenous arts and sciences; a review of copyright collecting agencies; improvements to the Australian academic and research network to permit broader access; resource levels for government primary schools; upgrading the CES to improve services to clients; and establishing a network of over 300 open learning access centres. These measures are in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are refinements to the training guarantee; purchase of properties by skillshare; establish a special consultative group on training with non-English speaking background people; a long-term unemployed entitlement to program assistance; the establishment of a teaching accord; industry, enterprise and community involvement in training reform; Cairns campus development of the James Cook University; national strategy on the status of vocational education and training; provision of mature workers centres under the skillshare program; internationalisation of Australian education and training; and sports traineeships. Honourable members opposite whinge about the Olympics, but they will put those things in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other commitments involve strengthening consumer protection for renters in the private tenure; an export strategy for the housing and related industries sector; AIDC Ltd's star product; removal of developing country tariff preferences; extension of patent life for pharmaceuticals; and a centre for furniture design in Hobart&mdash;these measures are all in jeopardy because of the opposition's irresponsible behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to look in some detail at what some of these promises that we have delivered mean to ordinary Australians. In education and training the government will maintain and upgrade the CES, introduce new computerised vacancy display technology, enhance off-site facilities and telephone based client servicing. The provision of a deferred payment facility for students of the open learning initiative will allow students wishing to undertake a minimum of 75 per cent of the full-time study load to do so free of the immediate requirement to meet the cost of their study. Such a provision will increase access and ensure equity in the provision of education under the open learning initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional funding for group employment and training companies will provide start-up funds and expertise to assist existing group employment and training companies to further match up skills and facilitate restructuring and employment growth in that part of the Labor market not accessible to the CES. A national health policy will reduce clinically excessive waiting times for elective surgery. The opposition wants to stop this. The government has provided funds in the budget to fulfil the commitment of $25 million per year which will be available to reduce waiting times for elective surgery, particularly for the treatment of public patients in private hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth dental program for health card holders will provide access to subsidised emergency dental care and  basic dental services to health card holders. The budget outlays $19.2 million in 1993-94. This outlay will be tripled in the following year and doubled again the next year. Those opposite have put this in jeopardy. The seniors health card will allow people of pension age who do not receive age or veterans pensions to gain access to concessional pharmaceutical, hearing, dental and optometry services. Under the second national AIDS program strategy funding for the prevention and treatment of people living with HIV or AIDS will be doubled, totalling $104 million in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A reduction in medical overservicing and fraud will save the health budget an expected $25 million in this fiscal year and an approximated $60 million in the following year. We have a catch-up immunisation program against HIB disease for children. The opposition wants to jeopardise that measure. More than $10 million over the next two years will be made available to enable the implementation of the program to provide immunisation against HIB disease for children born after 1 April 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will review the adequacy of quality nursing care in aged care hostels. Those opposite want to put that in jeopardy. We have a national housing policy to provide funding to facilitate access to information for private sector renters about their rights. There is the development of a youth housing strategy, and the funding commitment for that is $0.6 million over two years. The aim of the strategy is to improve housing options for independent young people on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the investing in the nation child-care policy there will be a child-care cash rebate for working parents of up to $28.20 a week&mdash;$1,446 a year&mdash;for one child and $61.20 a week&mdash;$3,182 a year&mdash;for two or more children. This will apply to work-related child-care expenses for children up to 12 years of age. Child-care initiatives for sick children will assist families with working parents. Increased funding for playgroups will assist parents caring for children at home. National accreditation for child-care centres eligible for fee relief aims to ensure good quality affordable care in child-care centres. Opposition members have put these measures in jeopardy. Where is their responsibility? Then there is the extension of long day care child-care assistance to occasional care, and expansion in work related child-care places to meet a target of 300,000 places by 1996-97. </PARA>

It is quite interesting that, whilst he went on at great length to say what was in the budget, as he got towards the last two or three minutes of his speech he started to talk about things he did not like in it, and the honesty started to show through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Treasurer came into the House on 17 August he said he had a vision, competence, and trust in his budget to deliver the goods. Those three ingredients were certainly missing from this year's budget because it was really a `big bang or bust' budget. The budget is all of those things. It is certainly big. It is going to glean or gain $99 billion of revenue from the Australian people. It is going to go bust because the government is going to spend more than it will earn, to the tune of about $16 billion. It will certainly bust because, when we look at the comments from every lobby group around Australia, we do not find any of them saying that this is a good budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the comments that come to mind is from the trade union movement, the great supporter of the Australian Labor Party, which says that the budget is `an act of bastardry'. Right across Australia all lobby groups have been coming to see us on this side of the House asking what we can do to get this budget to a position where it will benefit Australia, where it will start to create jobs and address the real problems of this nation&mdash;unemployment, high debt, and the massive balance of payments problems that we have got in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this budget the government has treated regional and rural Australians with complete disregard and contempt. This disregard and contempt are attributed to a constituency in decline. Under this government this will accelerate. We have only got to look at research that is coming in from regional, rural and remote parts of Australia to see that the population is drifting from these areas to the cities. Worse still, the population is ageing. This budget will only hasten the decline in populations in regional and rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer may argue that this budget did not come without some warning because for many days&mdash;in fact, weeks&mdash;prior to bringing down the budget he was telling all in the nation who would listen that Australia was one of the lowest taxed countries in the OECD. This somewhat obscure announcement was in preparation for the huge tax slugs announced in the budget. It was the softening up approach&mdash;the progressive leaks; the controlled leaks from his office&mdash;so that people would think on the night of the budget, `We thought we were going to get worse, so it is not so bad. We are going to have to pay more tax but it is not as bad as we were led to believe in some of the leaks'. Clearly the Treasurer was saying that we are amongst the lowest taxed nations in the OECD. However, this analogy is quite irrelevant. Of the 24 OECD countries, 19 are in Europe. Included in the list are Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain&mdash;countries which are of only marginal importance to Australia. So he should not draw that analogy that we are amongst the lowest taxed nations in the OECD using those countries as an example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So often we hear the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) talk in the House in glowing terms about the opportunities in Asia.

Prior to bringing down the budget and during the budget process the Treasurer and the Prime Minister should have been talking about how we compare with the nations in the Asian area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must compare our performance with that of the Asian nations. We are geographically closer to them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Treasurer might think that he can sell this budget, the Australian people will not cop it. I have just listened to the tail end of the speech by the honourable member for Gilmore, and it is obvious that the caucus will not cop it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most despicable aspects of this budget is the increases in the fuel tax. The implications of those increases on regional and rural Australians have to be measured against the capacity of those people to pay. The great wealth of this nation is generated in regional and rural Australia, and this tax impost is going to fall heavily on the people who live in those areas and the industries located there. The tyranny of distance is as evident as ever. This government has done nothing at all to break down the great tyranny of distance in this country. The Queensland Farmers Federation said this about the tax measures announced in this budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federation is particularly concerned about the impact of the proposed fuel tax increases on rural people who have to travel further for goods and services than their urban counterparts. These people have no alternative means of transport&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as the honourable member for Gilmore quite rightly pointed out&mdash;</PARA>

In industries more dependent on transport the effect will be even more pronounced. On average it is expected that the excise increase will add $1000 to farm costs and reduce net farm profit by 10.4%.</PARA>
<PARA>The federation went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federation asks that you consider the following key statistics from the Farmfacts Lifestyle Survey which reveal how discriminatory and regressive is the impact of fuel based taxation of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that says it all. When a farm dweller has to access a supermarket, the average distance he has to travel is 30.2 kilometres; for someone in a capital city it is 1.9 kilometres. To access a hospital, the average distance that someone living in rural Australia has to travel is 34.2 kilometres; the average distance in a capital city is 5.9 kilometres. To access a child-care centre, the average distance that someone living in rural Australia has to travel is 39.5 kilometres; for someone in a city it is 2.7 kilometres. That clearly demonstrates how the tyranny of distance impacts on people living in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to a question concerning the rural adjustment scheme during question time today, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) said he had been consulting the president of the Queensland Graingrowers Association on rural adjustment, and the amount of money that is needed in Queensland.

In Queensland the Goss Labor government is talking about pulling up one-third of the Queensland railways. The people of Queensland started to pull the premier up when he went down this path, so he set up one of these committees. That is one of those things that the Labor Party is very good at. When the heat is put on the Labor Party it sets up a committee.

In order to drive efficiency and get costs down, people in rural Australia have modernised and have gone to the most efficient ways of handling their operations. What has this government done? This government has added another cost to the operation of those properties. It is going to cost another $6 an hour to run the average size aeroplane used in mustering operations. </PARA>

He is not on the frontbench because he is a small `l' liberal. Unfortunately, he had nothing to say so he pulled out the last card in the pack and talked about ambit claims.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) talked about the rural adjustment scheme, but he clearly does not understand it. The rural adjustment scheme is an interest subsidy scheme. Although governments make budget allocations for interest subsidy schemes, they will only ever be an estimate of what is required over the next financial year. Governments regularly top up the RAS in times of economic difficulty in the rural sector. That is what the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) said in the House today. He said that, if necessary, the rural adjustment scheme funding would be topped up, that supplementation would be found. It is right and proper that there should be a reallocation within the rural adjustment scheme before that happens, to meet the emergency needs in drought areas in Queensland. What the honourable member said illustrates that his party has no policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal coalition's policies in the last election basically consisted of a GST and massive cuts to government expenditure. What does it have now? There is no GST but I presume there are still the massive cuts to government expenditure. That is the coalition's problem. The honourable member for Maranoa, who is also an opposition frontbencher, is telling us what is wrong with the petrol tax. I come from a remote rural region&mdash;one of the most remote electorates in Australia. No-one has to tell me about the effect of petrol prices. Honourable members should travel in such places as Coen, Weipa and Bamaga in my electorate. I do not want the opposition lecturing me about the price of petrol.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the opposition has to address, and what Australia is addressing, is the problem that the FitzGerald report has recently raised in relation to the decline in Australia's national savings.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr FitzGerald has talked about solutions and on this side of the House there is some talk of unemployment links. That is not firm government policy; that is talk. We are facing the problems that face Australia. We are facing the issue of the decline in national savings. What does the coalition do? It is lining up with the Greens in the Senate simply to get short-term political advantage. Where is the principle there?

The honourable member did not talk about the industrial relations laws in Asia because they are draconian. One thing that those opposite will not talk about in regard to Asia, and the so-called Asian tigers, is the higher level of state intervention in the financial system in those countries that has promoted investment.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Liberal Party weren't talking about economics in the election, they had nothing to say.</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party in the 40s and 50s was based on people who were joiners; people active in the church and community service, charity organisations, who saw their party membership as one aspect of their obligation to contribute to this society.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">not the free choice, competition evoked by a go-getter like Hewson.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the problem. The go-getters and the right wingers have taken over the Liberal Party. They offer nothing to the majority of the working Australians, those people who joined the Liberal Party in the 1950s. They owe nothing to those Australians who are unlucky enough to fall into the entrepreneurial class. They owe nothing to Aboriginal people; they owe nothing to the white leadership and the male leadership of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Brett refers to social groups such as women, Australians of non-English speaking backgrounds and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. She says that the Liberals continually insist that people are individuals before they are a part of the collective. No wonder those groups are sceptical about the Liberal Party. It offers them nothing. All it offers them is a role as individuals in society; they see nothing in their role as a collective force. That is why the Liberal Party has alienated women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people, non-English speaking people and the arts community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the brief time that I have I want to talk a little about my electorate of Leichhardt and the effect the budget has on it. It is interesting to note that when we talk about the Liberal Party, it holds no seat outside the metropolitan area of Brisbane, the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast&mdash;south-east Queensland. The best that the opposition has is someone called Senator Ian Macdonald, who is the shadow minister for local government and the ACT. Before the budget, Senator Macdonald suggested to the media in Cairns that the Far North would be affected by the Labor budget, that the Cairns campus of James Cook University would not go ahead and that the funding would be cut by the federal government. Senator Macdonald was wrong about that and he just caused a great deal of distress to people who attend the Cairns campus of James Cook because in the 1993 budget, the government honoured the Prime Minister's election promise to provide $9.5 million during 1994-95 and it increased the Commonwealth's commitment to $15 million. Of course the state government has put in an additional $6 million. This shows the federal government's commitment to education in the Far North. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Senator Macdonald keeps running around Far North Queensland trying to undermine that position. We do not hear him talking much about local government, and we certainly do not hear him talking about the ACT. I do not know how often he comes down here and talks about the ACT. I would not wish Senator Macdonald on the people of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in the budget was a commitment to bring both Triple J radio and SBS to the Far North. This is very important to my electorate. This means that my electorate in the middle of next year when we have SBS and Triple J&mdash;we will have SBS at the end of this year and Triple J at the middle of next year&mdash;will have all the free-to-air services that the capital cities have. That is very important. One week ago Senator Macdonald was running around, again causing concern in the Far North, saying that SBS would not be targeted. I see we have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous) here who is obviously interested in ethnic groups. Ethnic groups in the community were concerned. But I have been assured by the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) that SBS will be on target for Cairns. Again Senator Macdonald does not seem to be doing his job on the front bench, but just causing concern in the Far North. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry was also a big winner in the budget. The government has committed a $42 million package over four years to develop tourism in regional and rural Australia. Yesterday there was an announcement from the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) that applications and forms of the guidelines for the $23 million regional tourism development program had been sent to local government and tourism bodies in my electorate. That will provide tourism and local government bodies in my electorate with an excellent opportunity to get funding for much needed tourism infrastructure. That shows real support for the tourism industry from this government; real support for the need for infrastructure in the Far North; real support for a commitment to regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget, my electorate did very well in terms of local provision for Far North Queensland. It shows the interest of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the electorate. The Prime Minister is a regular visitor to Far North Queensland. Last week, when the Prime Minister was overseas, I had the pleasure of accompanying the Acting Prime Minister, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe), to the electorate. The Acting Prime Minister went to the Torres Strait and he also spoke in Cairns about the need for the provision of tourism infrastructure and infrastructure for the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cairns is a growth area. Some honourable members may ask, `What is the problem in Cairns?' The problem is that Cairns is a very high growth area, and that provides unintended consequences which affect people in the community. The fact is that there is a crisis in Cairns in relation to emergency accommodation. We took the Deputy Prime Minister to speak to housing groups and there was discussion in relation to the need for provision of emergency housing. That is not because there is no growth in Cairns, but because there is so much rapid growth in Cairns which puts pressure on existing housing. The promise of jobs and the climate brings people to the Far North and that creates a problem in relation to emergency housing. That problem was raised with the Deputy Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the government, through the Deputy Prime Minister's department and in conjunction with state and local governments, will set in place some sort of solution to that problem. These are the sorts of problems that this government is addressing. These are the sorts of things that the government is aware of and is doing something about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not hear anything about these sorts of issues from the so-called shadow minister for local government, Senator Macdonald. He is not talking about the need for infrastructure. He is not talking to local councils. He just goes through the electorate creating scare campaigns about this government. Of course, Senator Macdonald was the one who let the cat out of the bag in the election campaign about the GST and rates. It is amazing that he was reappointed as shadow minister for local government. I suppose as long as Senator Macdonald is in that position local government will still have the fear of extra taxation from a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the coalition has no policies. It has no policies nationally and it has no policies relevant to my electorate. All the coalition wants to do is cause a new election by any means, fair or foul. That is its real agenda; that is what it wants. The coalition figures that it can apply its unprincipled policies in this place when it has no revenue policies of its own. All it can do is oppose the government's budget strategy in the hope that somehow it will convince the Greens to line up with the coalition in the Senate and provide it with a new election. That is its real agenda. That is totally unprincipled and totally outside the principles that have been espoused previously by the Liberal Party. That is why Malcolm Fraser thinks the current coalition does not have the right policies and obviously that is why frontbencher Senator Vanstone thinks the same thing. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

If we are to achieve a budget deficit of one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, projected spending cuts will have to reach $9 billion. So far we are looking at only a $1.9 billion deficit reduction.

This is a government that has let public sector debt per head increase 400 per cent from $1,000 to $5,000 per head, while for the first time the rate of national savings fell into the negative in 1991-92. The markets have now found out that a tin-pot emperor has no clothes.

Company tax cuts for business must now be offset against the fact that half of the $3.6 billion extra taken in sales tax will be levied on business inputs. When we add this to the fact that half the $4 billion grabbed in the new fuel levy will fall on businesses, we can be assured that this Labor government has already substantially clawed back its $5.6 billion company tax concession. </PARA>

A government sometimes criticised for being too deregulatory, in 1991 excelled itself by adding 6,905 pages of legislation in 2,116 acts to the statute books.

Why should such sordid, practical details intrude into the world of our Labor decision makers? The attitude of this Labor government towards business in general is clear to see. This budget has visited a special animus against one particular industry, composed generally of smaller family enterprises. Wine producers in the Pearce electorate are wondering why they are being penalised through a 55 per cent sales tax rise, a rise conservatively translating into a nine per cent retail price increase. It is a matter of conjecture as to why this government confuses apples with oranges and draws false comparisons between wine production and that of beer and spirits.

It is essential for the broadacre farms in the Pearce electorate, for private motor vehicle owners, for people in rural shires, and for those living in the outer suburbs of Forrestfield and Swan View who cannot possibly rely on public transport for work and family needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the compromise forced on the government to reduce the punitive surcharge on leaded fuel used disproportionately by poorer Australians, we remain saddled with a destructive and essentially regressive tax hike. This government taxes petrol because it knows that businesses and families have no choice but to fill the tank, guaranteeing the instant revenue to pay for electoral bribes. The effect on such irrelevancies as export industries and household budgets need not concern them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elderly Australians, over 8,000 of whom live in Pearce, have received particularly cavalier treatment from this Labor government since its election. The pledge to remove all pensioners from the tax system, irresponsible as it may have been, was dropped without consultation, and now the promises for dental care and the seniors' health care card&mdash;that useful coalition initiative&mdash;have been deferred until next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has taken the adverse post-budget reaction for the government to finally acknowledge the blatant injustice of treating unrealised capital gains on shares as income for aged pensioners. Making the change prospective is only a step in the right direction, but it is still upholding the fiction that paper fluctuations constitute income and effectively precludes retirees from a prudent and effective form of savings. The repentance of the government has come too late for those retired people in Pearce who felt that they could not take the risk of sudden income loss and sold their shares. Australia will miss these small investors, even if the government does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in some areas since the budget the government has been forced to concede a measure of justice, in one vital area of social and economic life it is preparing to subvert business profitability and trample on the rights of employees. Projected changes in the field of industrial relations demonstrate economic irresponsibility, moral cowardice and total subservience to the ACTU. Perhaps it was too much to expect that a Labor government was capable of industrial relations reform, bearing in mind that much of our current economic dislocation is a direct consequence of the failure of the Hawke government to complement financial deregulation, including the floating of the Australian dollar, with freedom of choice in the labour market. This is, after all, the government that diverts $20 million of taxpayers' money to unions and is rewarded by the efforts of paid union officials in marginal seats at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a Prime Minister who is prepared to spit on the 70 per cent of employees who are not union members by denying them their right to enterprise bargaining unless they become unionised. It remains to be seen whether this craven surrender to the ACTU will allow genuine enterprise unions or whether the quest for a small number of bureaucratic union conglomerates will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian business, employees, the retired and the 400,000 long-term unemployed have gained nothing from this government's budget. It has to be recognised that we are not witnessing a few failures of judgment; we are witnessing the conclusion of a total failure of vision, commonsense and genuine compassion. For the life of me I cannot understand how the Prime Minister can get up and boast about this country's low inflation rate. He quite forgets to inform the Australian public that our near trading nation, Japan, has an inflation rate of 0.7 per cent and a business interest rate of 5.46 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like whoever is listening today to take note of the relativity between the inflation rate and the business interest rate because in Australia the same figures come out like this: yes, we do have an inflation rate of 1.4 per cent, but we are still charging our small business and micro-business sector, many of whom are run by families in this country, an interest rate of 11.25 per cent. It is the relativity that the Prime Minister forgets to tell the Australian people about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Prime Minister boasts about many of his achievements, leaving the Australian electorate speechless. Let me quote some of the things we have all heard over the last few years. In March 1990 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We won't let there be a recession.</PARA>
<PARA>And in November 1990 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a recession Australia had to have . . . I knew there had to be one but I didn't want to tell you.</PARA>
<PARA>In February 1992 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if we cannot make 4 per cent growth a year the whole lot of us ought to give it away.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder why the government has not done that, quite frankly, because it has done nothing. In January 1990 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In three years' time there will be no government debt, domestic or external. It's an enormous claim that I can make on behalf of the Government of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1987 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the great coming of age of Australia. This is the golden age of economic change.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1988 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the one which brings home the bacon.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1977 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What a politician needs is shrewdness, cynicism, cunning&mdash;and a lot of nerve.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that a lot of Australian voters can really relate to that. He eclipsed it all in 1990 to tell the Australian people:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am the Placido Domingo of Australian politics.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is an insult to Placido Domingo. If the Prime Minister and the Treasurer had been born 100 years ago they may well have had a very different career. They would have made a great duo as a travelling medicine show&mdash;the snake oil salesmen that roll into town on their wagons filled with their cure oils and their placebos, offering it to the ordinary folk to cure all their ills. When they have sold their useless cargo they leave town laughing with their pockets lined with the hard-earned cash of the townsfolk. The next day the people realise they have been duped. The snake oil remedy not only does not cure their present ills but also has given them a dreadful pain in the stomach that they cannot get rid of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian public have been fed this useless rhetoric for too long. If this government has any conscious at all, it will take an honest, fresh look at the regressive budget measures it proposes to bring down. It will stop the nonsense of building egos and start the real work of rebuilding Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the dust settles on the debate which has raged on certain items in the budget in this House and in another place I believe it will become increasingly apparent to all Australians and, indeed, to the opposition that this is one of the most significant and important budgets that the government has delivered for the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The goals of the government are quite clearly stated in the budget documents. The government aims for sustained economic growth that will provide Australians with the jobs so desperately needed in the future. Alongside that, the government will pursue social equity considerations by providing good health, good education and a good environment for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget is important for two reasons. The first and most important reason is that it sets a minimum term fiscal strategy that will provide the best framework for business investment, for long-term economic growth and the creation of full-time employment in Australia. Secondly, the budget delivers on over 100 promises made to the Australian population by the government in the course of the election campaign. This is certainly important to maintaining confidence in government and, indeed, in the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In meeting its election commitments, the government has introduced measures to extend child care to Australians, to improve the health system, to reduce the taxation burden on middle Australians and to expand their access to education and training opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is a landmark budget in the sense that it will have a positive impact on regional centres such as Geelong, the city that I represent in this parliament, and on regional development throughout Australia. It will do this because it provides an overall economic framework in which small, medium and large business can expand and grow. It will provide in the regions an important short-term stimulus to economic activity through the tax cuts and it will continue to provide training and infrastructure expenditure to build the economic base of the regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Pearce (Ms Moylan), who preceded me in this debate, talked about relativities. She compared the Australian economy with that of Japan. She should have mentioned the word `selective', because that is exactly what she has been. She omitted to compare Australia across the board with its major trading partners to get a more accurate picture of how Australia is situated in the world trading community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic factors have been canvassed significantly by previous speakers in the appropriations debate. Interest rates are an important cost to business and we have seen them plummet over the last five years. In the housing sector, which is one of the motor sectors in the Australian economy, we have the lowest interest rates for years. The housing affordability index is strategically situated for low and middle income earning families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a favourable climate for interest rates. That applies as well to the inflation rate. It is projected to be some 3 1/2 per cent in 1993-94&mdash;it is the lowest that it has been in three decades&mdash;providing a significant competitive advantage to Australian business. The inflation rate is also among the lowest in the OECD countries. This government can take great pride in that. This government has been the only government in the postwar era that has been able to achieve the low levels of inflation that are now locked in and will sustain businesses in their competitive position throughout the rest of this century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic growth is not as high as we would like it to be, but it is projected to exceed some three per cent in the second half of the year. Honourable members opposite ought to appreciate that growth in the Australian economy has fared extremely well in a very competitive international environment. The Australian economy is projected to be one of the leaders in the economic growth stakes in the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For business, we have lowered the corporate tax rate to 33c in the dollar, and we have provided to research and development a range of investment allowances and incentives that will be critical to the development of new products and innovative technology that will form the backbone of business development in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the tax burden as a percentage of GDP is among the lowest in the OECD countries. That is the sort of relativity that we ought to be looking at, not a selective relativity. We should not compare Australia selectively with one country such as Japan but with those nations in the world that are our trading competitors. When we do that, Australia comes out extremely well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial disputation is the lowest it has been for years. We have provided a flexible industrial relations structure in which genuine enterprise bargaining can take place. We have not ripped apart the fabric of Australia's industrial structure. That would have happened had the coalition been sitting on this side of the House instead of remaining in opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a virtual revolution in the export of elaborately transformed manufactures and that is set to continue during this decade. Many words have been spoken in this House about the developments in that export area, especially the development in the export of elaborately transformed manufactures. A virtual revolution has taken place and it is not understood enough by other governments at local and state level, in the business community and in the Australian community at large. However, as a government, we have been able to engineer a substantial reorientation of the Australian economy, with compassion and without the severe disruption that has beset other comparable economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to personal taxation, the government has continued to provide tax relief for middle Australia. The $2 billion stimulus in tax cuts in this budget will certainly provide a much needed stimulus to small and medium businesses in regional and metropolitan communities. We have also seen a return of company profitability to the levels that were enjoyed in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these economic factors are significant. The presence of high unemployment or a high deficit current account are not burdens that should weigh us down unduly. While they are problems to be tackled with all the resourcefulness and ingenuity that we can bring to bear, we should look to the positive developments in the structure of the Australian economy and how well it is situated to create jobs over the course of this century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have outlined the overall economic framework in which regional businesses will operate over the next year or so. I turn my attention now to the positive way in which the budget will impact on regional economies because the expansion of existing small and medium businesses, the growth of new enterprises and the development of new innovative technology on the back of the comparative strength of these regions will be critical to job creation in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, whenever I talk about the great developments that have occurred in the Australian economy, I am asked some legitimate questions, such as where the new jobs will come from. If we analyse the economic structure of some of our regional communities, the answer is self-evident. I am pleased to say that in this budget the government has recognised that and targeted its programs extremely well in order to meet the needs of the sector that will carry our economy into the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to honourable members that large job growth will not be found in the larger firms and businesses because they have become extremely efficient and have improved their productive capacity without taking on additional units of labour. The job growth will not really come from the public sector either.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own community local government amalgamation will see some 350 jobs disappear. At the state government level&mdash;in Geelong, for instance&mdash;the Kennett government has really ripped the guts out of the state public sector. We cannot hope for a return to any sort of job growth there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the federal government is concerned, we have done what we can with our available resources to improve job opportunities in Geelong. The location of the teleline facility, which belongs to the Department of Social Security, and the expansion of the Australian Taxation Office have both provided public sector employment via the federal government. We have pumped money into infrastructure development. We have continued to provide training and education expenditure to improve the skills of the local work force and expand its participation in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So where will the jobs come from? They will come from the small and medium enterprises that are already in existence and from the innovative technology that will form the backbone of the new businesses that will be created. Recently in my electorate two very innovative products came to my attention. While the businesses involved in those products are struggling to meet the point of commercialisation, they offer great opportunities for Geelong. I refer to the Gearing Dynamics oil immersed braking system, which is a revolutionary brake technology with widespread application to the motor vehicle and other industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, a young gentleman walked through my door with an innovative piece of software which he had successfully sold in the United Kingdom. He wants to establish his particular business in the great regional centre of Geelong, developing the software technology, and managing production and distribution of the product. He is having some difficulty doing that, even though not a large amount of capital is required to bounce the ball. That points to one of the problems that small enterprises have in these regions, namely, getting access to capital to develop their businesses. Both of the enterprises I have referred to offer great prospects for the development of job opportunities in the region. It must be the resolve and objective of the community to ensure that all the necessary support is provided to make sure that these enterprises see the light of day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years many factors have affected the development of the Geelong economy. Firstly, the Geelong economy has seen massive restructuring not only in its key industries&mdash;the textile, clothing and footwear industry and the motor vehicle industry&mdash;but in the manufacturing sector generally. I am pleased to say that some of the larger firms in those sectors recently increased the number of people they employ. Godfrey Hirst has been actively involved in developing export opportunities in Asia and elsewhere in the world, and over 150 employees have been taken on over a period of months. That company is successfully doing what the government set out as an objective for that particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last week in the motor vehicle industry Ford announced the creation of 50 additional jobs. Another factor which has affected the growth of the Geelong economy has been the lack of domestic demand, which has impacted fairly significantly on small and medium business. We have seen the effects of the international recession and the collapse of financial institutions, the problems associated with capital formation in this particular city and the declining confidence which is very similar to that which has occurred in other regional economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in this budget the government has crafted a very neat and well targeted set of programs to stimulate more small and medium enterprises into entering the export ring. There are enormous spin-offs for those firms that seek to expand their activities&mdash;the prospect of greater production runs; the achievement of economies of scale; greater productive capacity utilisation&mdash;which all lead to the lowering of costs, which in turn improves the competitive position of those enterprises. In addition, there is the discipline of producing quality products for demanding export markets which will stand those companies in good stead in the domestic markets into which they currently sell. Also, the energy and commitment of employees is unleashed when a company involves itself beyond its region, state and nation and successfully climbs into the global export ring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiatives announced in the budget focus on three specific areas. They provide coordinated services to strengthen the skill and the knowledge base of the small and medium enterprises. I am pleased that the government has provided in the budget for a significant expansion of NEIS. I agree wholeheartedly with the concept of the first stop shops and I congratulate the minister concerned for this particular innovation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that small and medium enterprises gain access to relevant and correct information and that a range of services be available in that one locality. That way time and effort are not consumed by enterprises doing the rounds of the bureaucracy, trying to discover which program fits their particular circumstance. I am particularly pleased that the government has provided for a national exporter education centre. We should not underestimate the value of export education in changing the culture of business in this community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased that the government has provided assistance to exporters. We will see faster payments occurring under the export market development grants scheme, increased funding for the international trade enhancement scheme and the expansion of the export access program. The strategic measures that have been taken also relate to a more aggressive market Australia campaign in these areas. The budget has provided a very significant amount of $94 million to assist small and medium enterprises over the next three years get into the export ring, strengthen the backbones of their business and provide and create greater job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I make some comments on the developments taking place in the regional policy development area. Quite recently, we had the publication of the draft report of the Industry Commission. As a general overview, there are some worthwhile recommendations in that report. However, I am critical of the report for several reasons: the weakness of its system of public consultation is very much exposed in the nature of the recommendations that the commission has made. Indeed, when people from the commission came to Geelong, they visited the Gordon Technical College, the Geelong Regional Commission and the Vehicle Builders Union. That is hardly going to give them an accurate impression of what is happening on the ground in Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see that the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) has walked into the chamber. I believe he made a constructive submission to that particular inquiry; dry as it may well have been, he did make a contribution. I know he is interested in getting the Geelong economy moving, as I am. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission draft report has several limitations. I think one of the great limitations of this draft report is the undue emphasis in its recommendations on labour market adjustment as a significant and central impediment to regional adjustment and its failure to really address some of the fundamental impediments to adjustments and growth in regional areas. I refer to some of the cultural obstacles in these regional communities that impede the development process and also the issue of the availability of capital. I think that there were only two pages in the report devoted to the critical issue of the expansion of existing business and the development of new business in our locality. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I might add that it is not known whether or not that is legal yet, because the bills have not been passed and have not gained royal assent. When he gets to the mid-north coast, he might stay in hotel or motel accommodation and pay the extra tariffs resulting from the new taxation measures. He might go and buy some wine at the local winery and pay the increased cost on that. </PARA>

He and his Canberra bureaucrats walk out of this place in the evening, drive down the wide, leafy streets to their perfectly planned suburbia and think that Australia is going along nicely, thank you. I have some statistics here that may open the Treasurer's eyes a little. This is a brief comparison between some of the demographic changes that have taken place in Canberra and my electorate of Lyne. The median family income in Canberra is $50,300; in Lyne, it is $23,690. Families with an annual income below $16,000 in Canberra&mdash;bearing in mind that Canberra is a much bigger place than my electorate of Lyne&mdash;total 2,018; in Lyne, there are 8,000 families with incomes below $16,000.

I will refer later in my address to the opening comments the Treasurer made on the night that he tabled his budget for 1993 in this House.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appalling to think that a Labor government, supposedly founded on the basis of equality for all, can create such an uneven and inequitable balance between two areas only eight hours apart by car.

The tax breaks that have been promised to the people of Australia will be passed immediately; the new tax implementation measures will not be. We are going to oppose those.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>There are eight bills in the Government's package of wool industry legislation. In introducing these bills to the House, I am confident that they will provide the statutory framework for a much stronger and commercially driven Australian wool industry. I believe the wool industry's long-term future as the supplier of a high quality premier textile fibre to world markets will be secured only if we fundamentally change the industry's structures to provide a more market driven approach that is more closely attuned to the needs of its customers and its end users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I consider both the food and natural fibre industries as presenting the most exciting development opportunities for this country, with the potential to substantially increase value adding exports and the jobs that go with such developments. We already have in place a strategy for development of the food industries through the work of the Agrifood Council, and the legislation I am introducing today will also provide the foundation for the wool industry to also grow and prosper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1993, I made an election commitment that I would commission an independent review of the role of the wool industry structures. One of my first actions upon being returned to government was to establish a review committee to achieve this. The committee, comprising Professor Ross Garnaut, Mr Rodney Price and Mr Stephen Bennett, brought an extensive background in wool industry, economics, trade, business, finance and marketing expertise to the review and presented a comprehensive blueprint for securing the future of the wool industry. It reported in August of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon receiving the Wool Industry Review Committee's report, I initiated wide ranging consultations with all sectors of the industry and modified the committee's recommendations to account for some legitimate industry concerns. I have, however, maintained the integrity of the committee's package in the legislation which I am presenting tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wool International Bill 1993 establishes a new, strongly commercially oriented organisation called Wool International, which will assume responsibility for discharging the $2.28 billion debt and disposing of the 3.9 million bale stockpile which is currently held by the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. It will also be responsible for the development for the industry of a range of forward selling, marketing and risk management mechanisms to provide a broader range of options for wool producers and others in the industry to market their product and to manage risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Bill 1993 will establish a new Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation which will be responsible for generic wool promotion and wool research and development.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wool Legislation (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1993 will repeal the three acts&mdash;namely, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991, the Australian Wool Corporation Act 1991 and the Australian Wool Industry Council Act 1991&mdash;on which the current wool industry arrangements are based. It amends the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 to remove provisions relating to wool research and development, which will now be encompassed within this new package of legislation. It also amends the Wool Tax (Administration) Act 1964 to require the provision of additional information concerning wool which is tax paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last five bills in the package each amend one of the five wool tax acts to reflect changes in setting wool tax rates necessary with the new industry structures. </PARA>
<PARA>This legislation reflects an integrated package of measures, and essentially these provide a three-pronged strategy for the wool industry, which are designed to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">establish industry bodies with a clear commercial focus;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">establish new mechanisms for marketing <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">wool; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">expand international trade in wool and wool products through the establishment of an Australian trade and investment package. </PARA>
<PARA>This new approach gives a greater emphasis on building demand, promoting quality and reliability to our customers and providing new marketing tools to spread market risk and to develop new markets, not only in the growing markets of Asia, but also in our more traditional European markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package represents a watershed in the development of the Australian wool industry because it establishes the means for enabling the industry to take more direct control over its own destiny. As such, it represents a critical step forward towards self-determination and independence for the future. It will see wool producers becoming key shareholders in their own wool marketing company&mdash;Wool International&mdash;supported by a professionally and commercially oriented generic promotion and research organisation, whose activities will be closely linked to those of Wool International to ensure complementarity and full exploitation of market opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structures embodied in this package reflect, on the one hand, the commercial thrust the government sees for the industry in the future and, on the other hand, the package reflects the government's continuing commitments to wool industry research and development and, through its maintenance of wool tax legislation, the funding of promotion. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Wool International</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most exciting element of the government's proposed measures is the establishment of Wool International. Within it is embodied a mechanism for effectively reducing the wool stockpile to commercial levels&mdash;giving producers equity in any residual value, including all wool and non-wool assets once the associated debt has been acquitted&mdash;and largely removing the government from much of its involvement in industry affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool International is established at the outset as a statutory authority with the intention that it be first corporatised and then privatised by a target date of 1 July 1997. This is a departure from the recommendations of the Wool Industry Review Committee, which were that Wool International be established as a 100 per cent government-owned company until privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that the government has decided on a three-phased approach rather than two is because it received legal advice that it would be difficult to move directly to a government-owned corporation. Relevant considerations included the extent of the debt that Wool International would have to initially take on and the practical difficulties of achieving corporatisation within a reasonable time frame. However,  in framing the legislation for Wool International, particular care has been taken to reflect as far as possible the model for government business enterprises so as to ensure that the commerciality of such bodies is a feature of Wool International. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wool International Bill provides, at this stage, only the framework for the second phase in Wool International's life corporatisation. Legal advice on the complexity of these processes means that it is better to leave the detail relating to corporatisation and privatisation until closer to 1997. This represents, in the government's view, the more responsible approach. At the same time, by providing the framework, we are clearly signalling our broad intentions and our commitment to privatising Wool International. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool International's functions will include the development of alternative forward selling, marketing and risk management mechanisms to better enable industry participants to market their product, manage their cash flows and their risks. In the period leading up to privatisation, a key activity of Wool International will be to effectively manage and market the wool stockpile and to reduce the debt. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fixed disposal schedule</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the decisions taken in April this year by the government, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission is in a position where it is not required to sell any more wool during 1993-94 to meet its debt reduction schedule. It may however sell further wool if there is sufficient demand. A central element of the marketing of the stockpile under Wool International will be the imposition of a fixed sales schedule. This is central to the development of forward selling mechanisms and the establishment of wool futures and other commercial risk management tools. The government has decided, however, that the fixed schedule will not commence until 1 July 1994. Until that time, Wool International will be required to manage the stockpile in accordance with current policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have indicated previously that the process of stockpile disposal will be a transparent one. The legislation clearly sets out, for all in the industry, exactly how much wool must be sold in any month or quarter. Although the Wool Industry Review Committee recommended that Wool International be required to release five kilotons per month a fixed quantity of wool between 1 November 1993 to 30 June 1994 and then 33 kilotons per quarter from 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1997, the government has delayed the introduction of the fixed schedule to 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deciding to delay the introduction of the fixed schedule to 1 July 1994, the government was concerned to honour its existing commitments regarding stockpile disposal, which apply until 1 July 1994, and to allow more time for the development of forward selling and risk management tools by Wool International. The introduction of a fixed schedule is central to the development of such tools and it is prudent to allow the additional time for this to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From July 1994 until December 1994, the fixed disposal rate is to be within a narrow range around five kilotons per month. In commercial terms, this translates into the range of 27,700 to 29,100 bales per month. The narrow range has been introduced purely for practical reasons. From 1 January 1995, the disposal rate is to be in the narrow range around 33 kilotons per quarter, or 182,000 to 192,000 bales. These ranges represent around five per cent of each of the relevant target rates of 28,400 per month and 187,000 per quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool International will be required to make a public statement monthly and then quarterly on its compliance against the disposal schedule for that month or quarter. This is expected to be a very simple statement although Wool International will have the opportunity to report more fully to industry should it decide on commercial grounds that it should do so. Wool International will not be required to report in detail on its activities in relation to stockpile management. It is intended to be a commercially oriented body and its commercial activities will be treated accordingly. Nonetheless, a confidential and regular reporting process will be required of Wool International by government on its disposal activities and its debt management activities generally while ever the government guarantee is in place. These reports will set out how the disposal schedule has been achieved in the relevant period and how revenue has been utilised. This will also provide government with an ongoing view of the body's debt profile and ensure its operations accord with its charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the period between now and July 1994, the government expects Wool International to make significant progress in setting up forward selling and risk management mechanisms for the industry. We appreciate that this will take time; however, the government believes that Wool International should be well advanced in this process by the time the fixed disposal schedule commences. During this period also, Wool International will be able to undertake other activities on a commercial basis. In this context, the government is well aware of the importance of market intelligence and reporting to the industry and, having yet to settle how industry can best undertake these activities in the future, a savings provision has been included in this bill to enable Wool International to continue to perform this Australian Wool Corporation function until 30 June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to privatisation, Wool International will primarily be a selling organisation. The government does not intend that it be a day-to-day trader in the marketplace. Neither is it to be a speculator. I will be issuing instructions to the board of Wool International that it develops Wool International's selling strategies specifically to meet its requirements under the fixed disposal schedule. The buy-in power would only be used in specific circumstances to meet the legislative requirements of the disposal schedule set out in the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the non-wool assets of the industry, the new board of Wool International will have the power to dispose of these should it decide it commercially prudent to do so. On the same basis, such assets may well be retained so that on privatisation, a portfolio of non-wool assets complements the wool assets and the overall net worth of the organisation. In the interim, Wool International will be able to use the revenue stream from these non-wool assets for its commercial activities. This will potentially generate around $25 million per annum of seed capital for its developmental work. However the government expects that as Wool International develops its own revenues from its other commercial activities, the need to draw on these funds will be reduced. The government intends to review Wool International's use of the seed capital in two years time to determine the need for continued access to these funds. Wool International will be required to maintain and report to government on this funding separately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will continue to guarantee the borrowings but will include the hedging activities of Wool International as these are related directly to the financial management of the stockpile. This arrangement will be through a statutory guarantee. The guarantee will not apply to any activities outside the stockpile management. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Determination of equity in Wool International</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Producers' payment of the debt component of the wool tax from 1 July 1993 onwards will give them their equity entitlement in Wool International on privatisation. However, provision will also be made for producers to increase their debt repayment contribution up to a maximum 10 per cent should they wish to acquire additional equity in Wool International. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To establish the equity rights of producers to shares in Wool International, it will be required to keep a register of wool taxpayers. The register will become the share register of Wool International on privatisation. The register will record the details needed to assign such rights, and in future, wool tax payments will need to be accompanied by information on the wool taxpayer. Any unclaimed shares will be re-allocated proportionately to all eligible wool producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On privatisation, shares will be issued to wool taxpayers at zero value. Should they subsequently dispose of them they will be liable for capital gains tax. The rationale for this is that the initial tax payment is tax deductible. To allocate shares with an imputed market value would effectively confer on wool taxpayers a double taxation benefit. In respect of voluntary contributions up to 10 per cent of the sale value of wool, the expectation is that they would not be tax deductible and the value of the shares for capital gains tax purposes would be based on the value of the contributions made. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also be shortly introducing the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Bill 1993. This bill will implement the merger of research and promotion that wool producers agreed to at their last AGM and will continue Australia's close involvement in the generic promotion of wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that there may at times be slightly grey areas where the activities of Wool International and AWRAP may impinge on each other. However, I will be relying on the commonsense and business acumen of the boards. The majority of membership of each board will overlap to ensure that, while they each have quite distinct roles to fulfil, there is a close linkage between the two functions. In resolving any potential areas of conflict over functions I will be relying on the chairpersons to be guided by the underlying philosophy of the proposed new structures that as much as possible of the current functions of the Wool Corporation should be transferred to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Board structures and appointment procedures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the boards of Wool International and AWRAP will be the key to the success of this package. In my view it is important that the boards not be selected on the basis of representation but on the calibre of their expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already mentioned, the boards of AWRAP and Wool International will have a majority of common members. AWRAP will have nine members while Wool International will have 11 members. Consistent with the wool industry review committee's recommendation, there will be a commercial approach to the selection and appointment of the Wool International board and, because of the need for overlap in the boards and the need for appointments to be expertise based, there will no longer be a selection committee process for AWRAP. It is intended that the minister will appoint members after wide consultation with the business community and with industry groups, including the Wool Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Staffing arrangements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Staff in the AWC and the AWRC will, in the first instance, become the staff of either AWRAP or Wool International on the establishment of those bodies. This will allow for some staff to be transferred between the two bodies if necessary to ensure the continuation of particular activities. Staff transferred over to the new bodies will be transferred on no lesser terms and conditions than existed prior to the restructuring. Thereafter, staffing matters will be the responsibility of the incoming boards. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool tax rate for debt management purposes is set out in the Wool International bill at 4.5 per cent and this rate will remain in place until privatisation. This will provide for Wool International to establish a net worth prior to privatisation. The rate cannot now be changed without amending the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool tax rates for promotion and research and development will be 3.5 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively and will apply for three-year periods rather than the current single year. These rates will therefore apply for the period July 1994 to June 1997 unless changed by grower ballot during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maximum rate of wool tax will remain at 15 per cent to allow flexibility to increase the promotion and research and development components if the industry wishes to do so, and thereby not constrain the ability of growers in establishing appropriate rates for promotion and R&amp;D through grower ballot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process of making consequential amendments of an administrative nature to the wool tax acts, the government is tightening up on the collection process by requiring that all collectors of wool tax be registered in future. This will ensure that wool tax can only be paid on behalf of Australian wool producers by a registered collector. The change is an important one for the industry, particularly in the area of future individual equity rights in Wool International. Such equity rights are to accrue in proportion to wool tax paid for debt management and the process for assigning such rights will need to be as tight as possible. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill establishes the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, AWRAP. I have already outlined how this particular bill fits into the total package of legislation for the wool industry. AWRAP will play a critical part in improving the performance of the Australian wool industry by encouraging the maximum possible coordination of the generic promotion of wool and wool products with research and development activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have long held the view that R&amp;D and promotion should be closely linked in order to get proper targeting of the R&amp;D effort and promotion activity. This view is also supported by the wool industry at its last AGM and was subsequently endorsed by the Wool Industry Review Committee. The aim is to get a more commercially driven and consumer responsive approach to these activities and this legislation will give effect to this objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation makes it quite clear that AWRAP's role is to direct the generic promotion dollar to where it will be most effective, including promoting the use of wool and wool products in Australia and overseas through consumer advertising coupled with the provision of technical advisory services in those markets which require assistance to develop and expand their wool processing industry, using Australian wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As well, it will assess research and development needs in relation to the wool industry, and provide funding for this purpose, and will disseminate and encourage the adoption of the results. There is clearly a strong link between the R&amp;D and the promotion activities, and the government is pleased to be able to respond to the industry's request that the two functions should be merged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generic promotion for AWRAP is envisaged as promotion in its broadest sense and encompassing such activities as consumer advertising, the provision of technical advice and assistance to wool processors, manufacturers and retailers to encourage wool and wool blend product processing and innovation to meet consumer needs, and supporting wool trade marks such as the woolmark. Generic promotion will also encompass a range of international market development activities both of wool generally and Australian wool in particular where these latter activities are directly related to promotion and are directed to encouraging processors in developing markets to opt for Australian wool rather than other fibres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, AWRAP's activities might be defined as those which promote the use of wool over other fibres but do not extend to direct marketing or sale of wool. Selling wool will be clearly the function of Wool International and other commercial suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the role of AWRAP is clearly focused on generic promotion, there is a need for this activity to be closely integrated with the advertising and brand promotion of companies promoting wool products. In the past, wool promotion funding has depended heavily on funds provided by woolgrowers and the government. This needs to change, and one of the principal goals of the new organisation will be to actively seek additional funding from commercial sources, principally wool processors and companies producing consumer wool products. I have made commitments to the industry that wool promotion will be adequately funded and the new structures provide the opportunity for this to be secured from commercial sources. For example, discussions are continuing with the International Wool Textile Organisation to assess its role in promotion funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AWRAP will be able to continue its participation in and fund international promotion activities of bodies such as the International Wool Secretariat, the IWS. The nature of, and level of funding for, such activities will be a matter for the AWRAP board, but the expectation is that Australia will continue to play a major role in influencing the policies and strategies of bodies such as the IWS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the activities of the Wool Research and Development Corporation will be transferred to AWRAP, the government recognises the success of the operational arrangements of that corporation. Therefore, the substructure of advisory and technical committees is expected to be maintained in the short term, although in the longer term this will be a matter for the AWRAP board to determine. The government will continue its matching of the research effort, the funding of which will be separately accounted for as part of the accountability arrangements to apply to the new organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also aware that, with the downturn in the wool industry and the reduced revenue base derived from the wool tax, it has been difficult to maintain the funding base for both R&amp;D and promotion. In this context, the government is well aware of the difficulties faced by the research and development corporation in trying to accommodate the fluctuating revenue base whilst continuing to provide for ongoing research programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The creation of AWRAP will provide some relief in this respect. AWRAP will have borrowing powers which, should the AWRAP board choose, could be used as a short-term smoothing mechanism to alleviate some of the impact of wool tax income variability on suppliers of research services. The government has been encouraging  greater commercialisation and comprehensive uptake of new technology and innovation by wool producers and processors. Increased commercialisation of R&amp;D will not only assist in supporting the competitiveness of wool in the world's fibre markets; it will also provide a means of generating additional income for research and development purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The promotion and research and development components of the wool tax will be determined through a ballot of producers, which may be conducted either independently of AWRAP annual general meetings, or in conjunction with them. The timing will be a matter for the board of AWRAP to determine. Provision has been made for the AWRAP board to formally consult the Wool Council of Australia regarding the appropriate rates of the promotion and research and development components of the wool tax to be put to a ballot of producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Annual general meetings will be continued for AWRAP only, although Wool International will be able to hold such meetings if decided by its board. The AWRAP AGM will provide the opportunity for wool producers to question the board of the organisation about the performance of its functions and, in the ultimate, provides the sanction of a vote of no confidence in the board. However, no provision has been made to take general motions from the floor of the meeting. There is no sense in such a process unless the outcome was to be binding on the board and that could, on occasions, be in clear conflict with the board's responsibilities under the act for the day-to-day direction of the organisation. Similar arrangements to those currently in place for the determination of voting rights will apply. However, the information needed to determine voting entitlements will, in future, be drawn by AWRAP from the share register to be maintained by Wool International. Upon privatisation of Wool International the register of wool tax payers will be passed to AWRAP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AWRAP will be required to prepare both corporate and operational plans each year and is expected to widely consult with industry in doing so. The corporate plan will define principal goals, outline strategies and nominate performance indicators and must receive ministerial endorsement before coming into effect. The annual operational plan will detail the activities required to give effect to the matters set out in the corporate plan and must also be submitted to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the proposed changes encompassed within the bills before the House can be implemented immediately. There are, however, two particular areas concerning the transfer of functions which have yet to be settled. These are quality assurance and shearer training. AWRAP is expected to have a very focused and concentrated approach to generic promotion and not be distracted by a wide range of other activities. It will therefore be an immediate task of the new AWRAP board to drive the process that will ensure the earliest and successful divestment of functions, particularly those concerning quality management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that the transition is effectively made, and that there is no break in continuity in the performance of those functions, the legislation includes savings provisions, the effect of which is to enable AWRAP to continue to perform this function until an orderly transfer can be achieved. The savings provision will apply for no longer than the period to 31 December 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is well aware of the importance of quality assurance to the future of the wool industry. Indeed it has been a strong advocate of the adoption by the industry of a quality management approach to marketing. It therefore has no intention of having the function taken from the Australian Wool Corporation without ensuring that there is a workable, effective arrangement in place for the function to be performed by other bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention is to progressively hand over those functions identified for transfer from AWRAP to other bodies which the government, in consultation with AWRAP, deems can effectively take up particular responsibilities. This means we can ensure a smooth process of divestment from AWRAP, without dislocation of quality assurance, and our customers' ability to be reassured about the quality of our product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The various alternatives will be carefully examined over the coming months during the transfer process. Without being definitive, the divestment process might include a role for the Australian Wool Exchange and the Australian Wool Testing Authority. It might also be possible, given the extent of standards already developed, that an Australian standard could be developed for woolpacks and that this be reflected in customs regulations replacing the current reference to the Wool Corporation's involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that the wool industry can, utilising the standards currently in place and developing new ones, bring an industry wide response to building on and further developing Australia's already high global reputation for premium quality wool. Wool quality is an industry wide challenge and there are already examples of innovative responses which demonstrate that different sectors are prepared to meet quality goals to better differentiate their product in the marketplace and so attract buyer premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool broking companies are already encouraging producers to distinguish their product by meeting predetermined quality standards in the shearing shed and I am aware of the work being done on this by Dalgety and Elders for example. Systems for wool testing in Australia are already regarded as the world's best. Shearer training has long been organised and funded by the Wool Corporation through the wool tax. The government is already working with the Wool Corporation and relevant training agencies to determine the most cost-effective approach for the future, given the particular nature of shearer training. There is the opportunity to bring shearer training into mainstream technical training approaches, such as through TAFEs, and to link it in an integrated way to quality assurance systems involving a better understanding of clip preparation for fine wools. I expect the industry to actively pursue these opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, a savings provision has also been included to provide for the continuation of funding for exotic animal disease eradication programs which is to run through until mid-1995. In conclusion, with the creation of AWRAP there is the opportunity to better coordinate and commercially focus wool promotion and the R&amp;D effort. The wool industry is facing a period where industry funds for promotion and R&amp;D are at their lowest levels for some time. The more streamlined approach which AWRAP will bring to the industry will allow a better focus on achieving returns for the industry for the benefit of all participants.

<PARA>This bill gives effect to the undertaking given in the budget to introduce new measures to combat overservicing in the Medicare program, including pharmaceutical benefits. The bill represents the first instalment in a series of measures that will be taken by the government to minimise abuse of Medicare. Further measures to deal with fraud and with audits, and to prevent double dipping by visiting medical officers against public hospitals and Medicare benefits, will be implemented progressively. Legislation for new fraud measures is expected to be introduced into the parliament by the end of the budget session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Health Insurance Act outlined in this bill reflect the outcome of a close consultative process with the Australian Medical Association. The AMA has played a key role in the development of the new measures and, in so doing, has demonstrated that it takes seriously its expressed belief that it has a duty to cooperate in ensuring that the public resources earmarked for health care are appropriately utilised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new measures in this bill are necessary because the existing mechanisms for dealing with overservicing have come under question and have not been shown to be effective. The strengthened professional review process in this legislation should not concern the vast majority of practitioners. However, it should cause those practitioners who misuse or deliberately abuse the current benefits arrangements to reflect on their activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review process is not to be invoked lightly. It is the government's intention that no practitioner will be subjected to the review process until he or she has been seen by a medical adviser of the Health Insurance Commission. The practitioner is to be advised of the commission's concerns about the practitioner's practice and given a chance to consider his or her position, which could include seeking the advice of his or her professional colleagues. Only if the practitioner's practice continues to cause concern will he or she be referred for review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Audit Office found in its Audit Report No. 17 1992-93, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medifraud and excessive servicing: Health Insurance Commission</EMPHASIS>, that medical services committees of inquiry, the current bodies responsible for dealing with excessive servicing, were not operating satisfactorily and needed to be strengthened. The ANAO concluded that specific action needed to be taken to deal adequately with gross levels of overservicing. One of the principal complaints about the existing mechanisms for dealing with overservicing has been that they do little to discourage the provision or initiation of excessive services. They are not effective deterrents because, in many instances, the level of benefits recovered from practitioners has been totally eclipsed by the level of overservicing actually engaged in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major factor in the inability to impose penalties commensurate with the extent of a practitioner's overservicing is the current lack of power to make decisions on the extent of overservicing on the basis of generalised evidence. At present judgments about overservicing can only be made on the basis of individual services, that is, recovery of benefits and the imposition of penalties can only be made in respect of each service separately determined to have been excessive. A further criticism of the current overservicing detection arrangements relates to delays in finalising cases, including delays occasioned by practitioners under review declining to appear at hearings because existing penalties for non-attendance are insufficient to ensure attendance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office report suggests that the minimum requirement to make medical services committees of inquiry more effective are:</PARA>
<PARA>.increasing the amount of repayment, and/or penalty, required to be paid by practitioners found to have engaged in excessive servicing to reflect more closely the actual extent of moneys involved;</PARA>
<PARA>.power for the committees to access medical records;</PARA>
<PARA>.appointment of additional committees to help reduce time delays;</PARA>
<PARA>.follow-up counselling to be taken by the chairpersons of the committees; and</PARA>
<PARA>.appointment of a full-time manager to oversee the operations of committees. </PARA>
<PARA>While the provisions contained in this bill do not provide a continuing role for medical services committees of inquiry, they do address the audit office's views on what is required to make dealing with excessive servicing more effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the replacement of medical services committees of inquiry by professional services review committees. Whereas the basic composition of committees of inquiry remains constant regardless of the nature of the services that are subject to examination, the composition of the professional services review committees will vary according to types of services that are subject to review. For example, the empanelling of a committee to review the rendering or initiation of services by a specialist in a particular specialty would be on the basis that the majority of the committee would be specialists in the same specialty. This means that there should be little cause for a practitioner to question the committee's competence to deal with the matters referred to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant change in the bill is the replacement of the concept of excessive servicing with one of inappropriate practice. Whereas excessive servicing is currently defined as the rendering or initiation of services not reasonably necessary for the adequate care of the patient, the concept of inappropriate practice goes further. It covers a practitioner engaging in conduct in connection with the rendering or initiating of services that is unacceptable to his or her professional colleagues generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another significant change is that the bill provides for the application by professional services review committees of the findings from a statistically valid sample of services rendered or initiated by the practitioner under review to the whole class of services that are of concern. This will constitute a far greater deterrent than the application of the current excessive servicing benefits repayments and penalties. The statistical procedure for making the necessary calculations has been developed on advice from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and protects adequately the rights of the practitioner under review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further important change lies in the penalty that will result from the refusal of a practitioner to attend a hearing or to produce documents when required to appear before a professional services review committee. If a practitioner refuses twice to comply with the requirements of a written notice of hearing, that practitioner will be fully disqualified from Medicare until such time as he or she agrees to comply. The inclusion of this provision reflects a view shared by the government and the AMA that a practitioner whose conduct in the rendering or initiating of publicly funded services is open to question should be required to participate in a professionally oriented process of review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the creation of an independent director of professional services review. The occupant of this position will be responsible for considering referrals for review from the Health Insurance Commission and deciding whether to empanel a professional services review committee from members of a professional services review panel drawn from the relevant fields of professional practice. The director will also have the power to dismiss a referral or to impose, but only with the consent of the practitioner who is the subject of a referral for review, a partial disqualification from Medicare. The director, who will be in effect the manager of the entire review process, will be required to report annually to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Health Insurance Commission will no longer be responsible for providing the secretariat. However, the director may make an arrangement with the Health Insurance Commission or another Commonwealth authority for officers of the authority to be made available to assist the director in the performance of his or her duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives the profession substantial autonomy in examining and reaching findings on inappropriate practices. At the same time, proper care has been taken to ensure that the practitioner under review receives natural justice. At every major point in the review process the practitioner is given the opportunity to make submissions that could influence the review process and outcome. The bill provides for the separation of the three elements of the decision making processes which are:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the referral for review;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the review hearings and findings; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the determination of any penalty. </PARA>
<PARA>The Health Insurance Commission prepares and refers a case for review to the director of the professional services review who decides whether to empanel a professional services review committee. The review committee reports on its findings and, if the findings are adverse to the practitioner under review, a determining officer, who must be a person holding an office or appointment under the Public Service Act, must determine one or more of the following courses of action:</PARA>
<PARA>.a reprimand;</PARA>
<PARA>.counselling;</PARA>
<PARA>.repayment of benefits to the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA>.payment of a penalty to the Commonwealth; and</PARA>
<PARA>.complete or partial disqualification from the Medicare scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The determining officer will be required to provide the practitioner under review with a draft determination on which the practitioner will have the opportunity to make submissions before it becomes final. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill retains the current appeals mechanisms with an appeal to the professional services review tribunal, which will replace the medical services review tribunals and the optometrical services review tribunals.

<PARA>The purpose of the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill is to amend the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Act 1981 to raise the maximum rate of oil pollution levy which can be applied to commercial shipping using Australian ports. The levy, which was introduced in 1973, provides funds towards the costs associated with operation of Australia's national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national plan brings together Commonwealth, state and territory and industry expertise and combat capacity under one national contingency plan. Since 1 January 1991, it has been administered by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA. The levy funds the administration of the national plan, including equipment acquisition, maintenance and training. It also provides a contingency fund to cover costs incurred in responding to marine pollution incidents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act currently provides that the rate of levy, per quarter, is such rate, not exceeding 4c per tonne of the tonnage of the ship, as is prescribed. The rate of levy at present prescribed by regulation is 2.2c per tonne. However, it is intended that this rate be raised to 4c per tonne from 1 October 1993. This increase will enable AMSA to implement the recent decisions of Commonwealth and state transport ministers aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These decisions flowed from consideration of a high level review of the national plan by a Commonwealth-state-industry working party. Additional funds are required to purchase additional response equipment to enhance response capability in the event of major spills and put in place contractual arrangements to enhance fixed wing dispersant delivery capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the prescribed rate of levy to meet these additional funding demands will, however, remove the leeway that has previously existed between the rate of levy prescribed by regulation and the limit on the levy set by the act. This leeway is essential to allow AMSA to react speedily to a large funding requirement that might arise in the case of a major incident. While in almost all cases costs of responding to oil pollution incidents are recovered from the polluter, there is an immediate call on funds, and it may be some time before these can be recovered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In such cases the ability to increase the levy by regulation will allow AMSA to borrow funds at short notice by giving it the financial capacity to service and repay such a loan from the levy. The increase in the maximum rate of levy that can be prescribed to 6c per tonne as proposed in this legislation maintains the current relationship between the rate of levy prescribed by regulation and the maximum rate capable of being prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government hopes of course that we will never need to raise the rate of levy to pay for the clean-up of a major spill. The government believes, however, that it is essential for AMSA to have the capability to respond quickly should such an unfortunate event occur.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary objective of this budget is jobs . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the night of 17 August, the unemployment rate in Australia stood at 10.7 per cent. Buried deep in the budget documents was the government's forecast that 12 months hence the unemployment level would be 10.75 per cent. So who was the Treasurer trying to kid when he said that the budget was about producing jobs? The government has no intention of producing jobs. It is telling us that the unemployment level is going to be the same in 12 months time as it was on the night of the budget. That is an absolute joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we saw Australians react to this budget with outrage. I am a new member of this House but it frightened me to see the people in the public gallery during the weeks following the delivery of the budget stand up and abuse the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. I am sure that they were true believers who felt absolutely and totally betrayed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's argument that it will be the fault of the coalition if we do not see tax cuts by Christmas is wrong. If the government supported the coalition amendments, the tax cuts would sail through. We are opposing 1.5 per cent of revenue; that is all the coalition is trying to amend. It is not the opposition that is being irresponsible. It is our job to oppose and to try to amend areas of legislation that need improvement. That is what we have been elected to do. The people of Australia are demanding that we take a stand on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's own action in linking bills, not once but twice, that is unbelievable. The first group of budget deficit reduction bills introduced into this House were found to be unconstitutional. The Treasurer could not help himself, and in the second group of budget bills&mdash;the eight that were passed through from this House to the Senate under the guillotine this week&mdash;he linked two items pertaining to tax increase. Whether those items are constitutional or not is still questionable. If the government was fair dinkum about providing these tax cuts by Christmas it would not have linked these measures; it would have kept them separate. The government knew what our stand was. It knew that those measures would have gone sailing through and have been passed in the Senate by now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all remember the night of 30 August, the night of the infamous caucus meeting that blew up on the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. For some time now, the opposition has been berated in this House by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for being economic vandals, for being wreckers and for pulling the budget apart. At this stage, we have said only that we are going to oppose certain tax increases. We are on to the third draft of the budget and who has done all the amending? The government backbench&mdash;the caucus. It has done the amending because it has been put under the same amount of pressure from the people around Australia as opposition members have. The caucus knows that the people feel betrayed. It knows that the government had to do something about the situation. The government backbenchers in that caucus meeting gave that message quite clearly to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might have been a double bunger; that is for sure. I would like to remind the House of some things that we all need to remember. On 31 March 1992, when the Prime Minister spoke about budget forecasts, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if we cannot make 4 per cent growth a year, the whole lot of us ought to give it away.</PARA>
<PARA>This budget forecasts growth of 2 3/4 per cent. When is the Prime Minister, and more particularly the Treasurer, going to give it away? On 13 May 1987, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia now stands on the verge of breaking away from its precarious dependence on a narrow range of primary exports. In doing so, we will free ourselves from the dictates of the international financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA>When the Prime Minister made that claim, in May 1987, net foreign debt stood at about $86 billion. In the six years that have followed it has more than doubled. On 24 January 1990, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In three years' time there will be no government debt . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was in January 1990. Here we are in September 1993 and look at the massive debt we have. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In three years' time there will be no government debt, domestic or external. It's an enormous claim that I can make on behalf of the government of Australia. The government's debt for this year will rise to approximately $85 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>We should remember what the Labor Party promised the people of Australia during its election campaign in March this year: no tax increases, no GST, and Medicare to remain intact. In my electorate, the ALP booth workers at every single booth handed out how-to-vote leaflets which said, `Vote for the ALP. Vote against GST. Vote for Medicare.' What was one of the immediate measures proposed in the budget, not even six months later? It was the removal of optometrical services from the Medicare rebate scheme. No wonder people were outraged. No wonder there were so many people contacting my office and the office of every other member of this House. They felt totally betrayed by the fact that the promises made in March were so very quickly broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad indictment on the government is that it was its own backbench&mdash;nobody else&mdash;who forced the change of heart on optometrical services before it got any further. The backbench knew&mdash;it had a heart&mdash;that it had to honour promises from 13 March 1993 otherwise the government would be totally discredited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxes that are proposed to be introduced in these budget bills are taxes on regional development. Today we heard many speakers in this House talking about the importance of regional development and what the government can and cannot do. The very first thing the government should do is become far more equitable with its taxes as far as regional Australia is concerned. The fuel tax is a tax on regional development. The wholesale sales tax is a tax on regional development. The wine tax is a tax on regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These taxes are an insult to businesses in this country, businesses that the government is expecting to get the country going again. Yet it continues to burden these businesses with more taxes.

No wonder we are struggling at the moment. </PARA>

If he would like to hand me the words of Mr Spicer with which he was about to finish, perhaps I could start with them. I take it that if I am speaking after my National Party colleague the government has given up and finally lost interest in the debate completely. It will not be evident to the people listening to the debate but, except for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Punch) at the table, there is not one person on the government's side of the parliament tonight. One can only imagine what they might be up to. I think this probably indicates their disinterest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps they have lost hope. I suppose it has been a fairly traumatic few weeks for the government, as it has been for all the people of Australia who have watched this budget fiasco lurch from crisis to crisis. Here we are at the end of another week of sitting in this place and I do not think any of us are very much the wiser about where we will end up with the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget is like a moveable feast. It is a bit hard to get a handle on the latest situation in any aspect of it. While the honourable member for Lyne might not have been in this place very long, I congratulate him on the fact that it has not taken him very long at all to actually get the gist of the situation&mdash;the complete hopelessness of the government in managing this economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the whole 10 or 11 years that the government has been in control of this place, it has failed consistently to achieve anything. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has stumbled across the few gains that he has managed to get up and talk about. He accidentally achieved a low inflation result, but not by good management. That was simply a product of the circumstances in which the government found itself. With the mismanagement that the government has actually inflicted upon us it is a wonder that we do not have deflation in this economy. The government deserves no credit at all for low inflation; it was purely an accident. Although in many respects low inflation may be fortuitous, the government can claim little credit for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure whether in real terms interest rates are that low at all. In absolute terms, real interest rates have come down, but they did so from historically high levels. It was this government that inflicted upon this economy the highest interest rates that we had just about ever had. During the years of mismanagement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he was Treasurer, businesses were consistently going to the wall as they laboured through years of horrifically high interest rates. So the government can claim very little credit at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 11 years of being in government what does the Australian Labor Party really have to show? One million unemployed and an enormous debt. Those are the two huge, outstanding economic matters on the agenda of this country, neither of which this government has any answer for. This government has no answer to the unemployment problem and no answer, that I can see, to the ongoing problem of the deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time of the honourable member for Lyne expired before he was able to put on the record what Mr Spicer had to say about the budget. But I will correct that situation. Mr Spicer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its pre-Budget submissions, the business community sought reductions in government spending, reductions in the deficit and reductions in taxes on business inputs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead, the Government has seen fit to raise all three.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore a Budget which has damaged business confidence. It has raised concerns about the sustainability of recovery and made the business community even more wary about the future than it already was.</PARA>
<PARA>Undoubtedly that is a commonly held view about this budget. The business community has absolutely no confidence in the direction in which this economy is going, and no confidence in this government. The Australian people may have finally got to the point where, if an election were held tomorrow, they would get rid of the government. I do not know how the Labor Party won the last election. We have spoken about that. It stumbled across the line. To a large extent, I suppose it was our fault that it did, but it did. We were all amazed, but probably the government was even more amazed than we were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, the Australian people now recognise that they made a dreadful mistake on 13 March&mdash;and they did make a terrible mistake. We just wonder how long we have to suffer. Every day people ask me, `Can't you get rid of them?'. I cannot find anyone who voted for the government. It seems that, ultimately, almost half the people in Australia through their first, second, third or umpteenth preference voted for the government, but, amazingly, even in my electorate I cannot find anyone who did. Perhaps the people who did vote for the government are hiding. Although the government did stumble across the line, the people of Australia hopefully now recognise that they did make a mistake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a budget fiasco, with negotiations going on somewhere in the corridors of power in this place tonight I suppose. One wonders what the final outcome might be. I am sure that, if it could be arranged, the Australian people would support any action the opposition could take to bring about a double dissolution of this place. The people of Australia are telling me that they want another election and maybe that is possible, although unfortunately I do not think it will be that easy. It seems that we will have to suffer for another couple of years before we can finally have a change of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully by then, if the country has not been completely destroyed, people will be ready for the sorts of fundamental changes that really need to be made rather than bandaid solutions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent report of the Industry Commission gave the government some clues about how to reduce unemployment. But the government immediately rejected many of those very valid points on the need to bring wages into line with what the market can afford, and ultimately that is a very real part of the solution. In this country, the Labor Party has created a whole system of wages way beyond what people should be entitled to&mdash;unless they deliver on a productivity level, but they have not done that. That is protected by a centralised wage fixing system and it has often happened behind tariff walls of protection and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now businesses cannot afford to pay those award wages, which has resulted in unemployment. The government has then picked up the other side of the equation, which is all the unemployed people to whom the government has had to pay welfare through unemployment benefits. Rather than create a system whereby people can actually go out and work, the government has put them on welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, there are fewer people in the work force paying taxes to pay the welfare. There is an ever diminishing number of people who are silly enough to be out there working, rather than choosing paid leisure, which means that the demands on the taxpayers are ever increasing. No amount of obfuscation on the part of the Prime Minister or the Treasurer can disguise the fact that the government has lost total control of the economic management of this country. No diversion, whether it be the republic, the flag or&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;even the Olympic Games, can lessen the government's culpability in respect of its massive mishandling of the Australian economy. The Treasurer, in his budget speech&mdash;it seems like years ago now; it is only a short time ago&mdash;made, almost as his opening gambit, the incredible claim that has been repeated in this place many times that `this budget is about jobs'. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The greatest issue facing our nation is how to provide jobs for our fellow Australians . . . The primary objective of this budget is jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet, when we read the budget papers, we find very quickly that the whole budget is based on the assumption that unemployment will be virtually unchanged. The unemployment rate on budget night was around 11 per cent. When we read the budget papers, we find that it is going to be about the same, at 10.75 per cent&mdash;close enough to 11 per cent&mdash;at the end of 1993-94. The only difference is because the participation rate comes down a little, so the government has fiddled with the participation rates fractionally to achieve that slight reduction in the unemployment rate. The budget papers go on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While some reduction in the unemployment rate is expected by mid 1994, progress on reducing unemployment fundamentally depends on achieving faster rates of economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no evidence in the budget that these faster rates will be achieved. The growth rate in the Australian gross domestic product in 1992-93 was 2 1/2 per cent. The Treasurer likes to think that is pretty good. He likes to compare that with rates of growth in the OECD&mdash;the developed countries. It may well be that, compared with Japan, Europe and perhaps even the United States, 2 1/2 per cent in 1992-93 was not too bad. What he and the Prime Minister fail to do when it suits them is to not compare us with our Asian neighbours. Our Asian neighbours are achieving rates of growth well in excess of 2 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister likes to tell us that Asia is our part of the world. He tells us that when it suits him, but day after day when government members get up in here and try to tell us that 2 1/2 per cent growth is good, they compare us with parts of the world which are not directly comparable with us at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget forecast growth rate for 1993-94 is 2.75 per cent. However, the other underlying flaw in the whole of this argument is that most of that growth rate is in the public sector. Once again, it underlines how wrong this government has got it. The budget papers state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public investment is expected to grow strongly as spending on One Nation and other infrastructure projects reach a peak and investment by the Commonwealth Public Trading Enterprise increases.</PARA>
<PARA>Without this huge government spending or stimulus&mdash;that is the word these days: stimulus&mdash;that the government is putting into the economy, growth would be very limited indeed. In fact, there is still a lot of evidence around that the private sector remains stalled or worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This really begs another fundamental question besides the question about the unemployed for which the government admits, in effect, that it has no answer in this budget, because we had one million unemployed at the beginning, and we have one million unemployed at the end. The other important question is: how long can the government keep propping things up with government expenditure? Last year we had a deficit of $15 billion-odd. This year it is projected to be $16 billion. Even that is an underestimate. If we add back all the tricks and creative accounting that the government uses, the actual deficit for this year could be as high as $25 billion. How long can we continue to live on the never-never?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is this deficit the public deficit, but each month we fall behind in terms of our gross national debt. There is no suggestion that we will ever get that under control. The best hope the government can give us is that by 1996 it might get the deficit down to $6 billion. That is, by 1996, if we accept the government's target of one per cent of gross domestic product, we might have a budget deficit of $6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to continue to live on the never-never. We must get hold, the same way as any individual household would have to, of the fact that we cannot continue to spend more than we are earning. Yet the government suggests, and its budget papers confirm, that that is exactly what it intends to do. The proposed measures that it outlines to cut the deficit are completely unconvincing as well. There is nothing in this budget which guarantees that the deficit will fall to one per cent of GDP, even if that were a worthwhile objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line really is that this government is incapable of managing this country. It has no plan at all. I believe that the Labor Party simply takes the view that the government ought to solve all of our problems. As I said before, it is great at coming up with all sorts of programs. I still think it believes that people like to get a knock on the door, open it and find that the person outside says, `I am from the government and I am here to help you'. That attitude is pervasive. It applies to business, families and just about every aspect of Australian life. This Labor government still takes the view that it can solve things better than individuals can for themselves. It is just not the case. Until it gets that message right, until it understands that, it will never get anything right. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we wanted to be terribly simplistic about it, the point is that if we take these burdens off business, instead of putting them on, then business can start to talk about employing more people. That is the sort of employment growth we want in this country&mdash;real jobs; not jobs created by spending of the type that is envisaged in the One Nation statement. We can have people building roads, bridges, railway lines or whatever, but those jobs come and go. They are not real jobs in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way that we will solve the unemployment problem in this country is to get the private sector moving; to get off the back of business, particularly small business, and let it get on with the job of employing more people.

I told them it was going to be tough, they had to face the hard decisions, and they proved by their overwhelming support for me at the election on 13 March that they were prepared to stomach it. They were lied to viciously by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, my opponent&mdash;who was lined up for the job of Speaker in this House&mdash;and his party had very few policies. Indeed, as the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said here two days ago, the Labor Party had four major promises: to lower company tax; to lower the budget deficit to one per cent of GDP; to deliver personal tax cuts; and to not introduce a goods and services tax. This is supposedly what Labor went to the election with. I found it difficult during the election campaign to find any policy at all that Labor went to the election with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, at a rally at one of our local shopping centres, all of the candidates for the electorate of Stirling were invited to put the views of their parties and their particular viewpoint. When it came to my predecessor in this place, Mr Ron Edwards, to put the policies of the Labor Party, he was almost apologetic. When my turn came to put what our policies were, I could honestly say that I believed in everything that I was putting forward. I said to the people in that crowd, which numbered in excess of 2,000, `If anyone in this crowd today can show me the policies of the Labor Party I will give you $1,000 cash in hand because there are no policies'. We went to this election honestly and forthrightly and we were defeated by lies. That is something that the government has yet to come to terms with. But the chooks are coming home to roost in a big way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party also came out with a number of promises&mdash;all, of course, throwing money after votes. It made it perfectly clear that it would not increase taxes. If honourable members opposite want to suggest otherwise, I challenge them to tell me the date their party made it known the wholesale sales tax would increase. On what date did they settle that one? On what date did they make it known that the wine tax would increase?  On what date did they make it known the tax exemption on credit unions would be repealed? On what date did they make it known they would change the HECS payment rules? On what date did they make it known they would increase the petrol tax on both leaded and unleaded petrol? Name the dates. They cannot. These tax hikes were all made known on 17 August&mdash;185 days after the 13 March poll. They were certainly not made known prior to 13 March. When Australians went into the polling booths on that dreadful day, those who put a `1' next to the names of Labor candidates did not know they were voting for tax hikes as it has turned out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had some breathtaking comments coming from our ever so desperate Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). It makes me ashamed to be a West Australian knowing that he comes from the same state. But his classic in this place is that revenue as a proportion of GDP remains the same. The Treasurer says that, by having said that prior to the last election, Australians knew they were voting for tax increases. What absolute balderdash! People will not fill up their cars or buy some goods or have a glass of wine and think when they are charged more, `Oh, well, that does not particularly matter, at least revenue as a proportion of GDP remains the same'. Good God! What planet is this man from! If the Treasurer thinks people will accept that, then he is more foolish than I first thought. I assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I thought he was incredibly foolish to start with because I have known this man for a long time. I am afraid the silver spoon he had in his mouth since birth must be harming his brain. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some more foolish comments which the Treasurer; his acolyte, the Assistant Treasurer; and the Prime Minister have also made. They blame the coalition for the changes that have had to be made, yet what they fail to acknowledge is that 60 members of their own party shared our concerns. They led a caucus revolt opposing many of the budget measures. If members of the parliamentary Labor Party opposed certain budget measures in the caucus room, then it is obvious they of all people did not expect these measures to be introduced when they were running for office. It is therefore obvious that the government does not have a mandate to introduce many of these quite pernicious measures. It is therefore incumbent on us all to oppose this budget, a budget of deceit and betrayal. As I have heard from one of my colleagues in this place, who happens to be from the party opposite, going home to face their electorate is like facing a lynch mob&mdash;and they never expected this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be directing my attention to a number of changes which were flagged on 17 August, some of which have since been removed by the government following public pressure, but measures which the Treasurer wanted; changes which would have hurt the people who are stereotyped as being the true believers. The most surprising and deceitful change would have to be the increase in the wholesale sales tax. This is to rise by one per cent this year and another percentage point on 1 July 1995. This is a change by a government which promised jobs, not GST. The coalition promised to abolish the wholesale sales tax; the Labor Party never said it would increase it. If it wanted to increase it, it should have sought a mandate. People who voted Labor on 13 March did not know they were voting for an increase in the wholesale sales tax. They did not give Labor a mandate to increase the tax. If democracy is to be upheld, we must all do the responsible thing and oppose this increase, which is but one tax hike we should be opposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the wine tax. I guess the Treasurer cannot get a glass of `Chateau de cardboard' to his lips because of the silver spoon that I have already mentioned this evening; that could get in the way. This is another dishonest tax. As I have said before, when people put a `1' next to the name of Labor candidates on 13 March, they were voting to keep the wine tax at 20 per cent, not increase it to 31 per cent. This increased tax will destroy an industry which has been developing ever since Western Australia's first days of settlement. It is now sad to see a Western Australian or supposedly so&mdash;our Treasurer&mdash;now ruining one of the oldest and most successful industries in our marvellous state of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia produces annually about $60 million worth of wine valued at wholesale prices. More than 70 per cent of that is sold outside the state. The Australian Wine Export Council aims to increase exports of wine to $1,000 million by the year 2000. It would be great if our Prime Minister had goals like this for the year 2000 other than his own personal political ambitions for that year. If Western Australia achieves only five per cent in wine sales in achieving this goal, our wine grape production will double and require an investment of more than $50 million; yet the Treasurer, whose loyalty to Western Australia has to be questionable, wishes to jeopardise this valuable industry and, in doing so, harm the jobs and livelihood of many Western Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also the changes to the HECS, another revenue increasing measure which the government did not make known it would be implementing when it had ample opportunity to do so prior to the last election. These changes are blatantly dishonest and a stab in the back for more of Labor's so-called true believers. This measure is also quite interesting considering the support the Labor Party received from student unions at campuses right across Australia, and Lord knows I locked horns with a few of them during the campaign. I intend speaking on this measure in another debate and will elucidate on this measure then, but, again, the bottom line is that when students put a `1' in the box next to the names of Labor candidates, they were not voting for these changes to the higher education contribution scheme, and for that reason Labor does not have a mandate to implement them. These measures should also be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure, or should I say deception, was the government's decision to repeal the section 23G partial taxation exemption for credit unions. I had intended talking on this when it came before the House, but the government, obviously ashamed of its dishonesty, guillotined the debate and refused to listen to the truth about this and its other dishonest taxation measures. The repealing of this section was totally unexpected by credit unions&mdash;unexpected because the government did not say that as part of its policy at the last election it would repeal this exemption. Indeed, this exemption, in the past, until this budget, has had bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Credit unions are quite dissimilar from banks in that they do not have liquidity support from the Reserve Bank. Banks are not required to fund their own supervision; banks have a trustee status and resultant access to a greater pool of deposit funds&mdash;in fact, the list goes on. There are vast differences between banks and credit societies, a fact which has previously been acknowledged by both sides of this House, and the reason we have supported this exemption on a bipartisan basis. Nothing has changed to warrant this exemption other than the fact that the government is desperate for funds and it has gone against logic in repealing this particular section. Yet again, when the 3.1 million Australians who are members of credit unions voted at the last election, those who voted Labor were voting to keep this exemption, and for that reason we must also oppose this measure. The coalition has sent it to a committee in the Senate; however, I am of the firm opinion that it should be opposed without waiting for any committee reports. It was not a Labor policy prior to 13 March and so the government does not have a mandate to implement this totally dishonest measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two more measures where the government either fully or partially backed down. The scrapping of the Medicare rebate for eye tests was a cruel decision, and I am glad that 60 of the Labor caucus members acknowledged this as being cruel and forced the government to back down. It is a pity they did not seek greater changes to Medicare to provide incentives for individuals to take out private health insurance and leave Medicare as a health insurance system for those at whom it was originally aimed: the low income earners, pensioners and the unemployed. I urged in my maiden speech the Prime Minister, the Assistant Treasurer and others opposite who had not taken out private health insurance to do so because people on incomes like those of us in this House do not need to be subsidised by the taxpayer for our health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity the government did not take the opportunity in this budget to reform our health system, as it so desperately needs. It means we will continue to see it crumbling, as it has, and the people who will suffer most, as always, are those who can least afford private health insurance or pay for surgery themselves: the low income earners, the unemployed and the pensioners in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last dishonest measure was the tax changes to unused annual and long service leave. Whilst I welcome the abandoning of the retrospectivity element, as one constituent pointed out to me, this retrospective element was akin to reducing the speeding limit, making it retrospective, and sending fines to people who had driven the speed limit. It should not have been put forward in the first place. Yet again this is but another measure which, when people voted Labor, they thought they were voting to keep the status quo. They were certainly not voting to increase the tax on unused long service leave and annual leave and making it retrospective. As I said before, there is no mandate to increase this tax and, therefore, it should be totally and utterly opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, and very briefly, considering I have spoken on this four times already, the government stands condemned for discriminating against pensioners by deeming shares held by them which increase in value is income, and therefore cut their pensions, when anyone else who owns shares which rise in value is not punished at all when those shares rise in value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last election the coalition went into the election with a comprehensive policy package. On the contrary, Labor lacked any vision whatsoever or policies, as I have already mentioned tonight. Many of the measures announced on 17 August were not known about on 13 March, and therefore the government is not entitled to introduce them, and it has no mandate to. I would be totally ashamed if I were a new Labor member of this parliament, having been elected under those false pretences, to now have to put up with this ridiculous budget mark 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, or whatever we get to. </PARA>

This is not just a budget of betrayal. It is a shameful, dishonest, illogical and discredited package of lies. It contains measures which the government has no mandate to introduce, and I have no qualms about opposing it, even if it means going to another poll.

They would not believe anything Labor said because this budget has exposed the Labor Party for its blatant dishonesty. </PARA>

For it is now beginning to dawn on honourable members opposite that this budget does nothing to address the fundamental economic problems which confront our nation today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As former Labor adviser Richard Farmer said recently of the Keating government, this is `a government that has no idea how it got us into this problem and no idea how it is going to get us out'. The constantly growing foreign debt, an inability to give work to all who seek it, the need to increase national savings, the prospect of a return to unacceptably high levels of inflation and to rising interest rates&mdash;all these problems have been left untouched by Labor's budget of betrayal, and all reflect Labor's enormous failure to implement the reforms which will enable Australians to compete more effectively in the global marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1980s were a tragically wasted decade for Australia. A decade which should have seen the implementation of an historic reform agenda, instead, saw an historic dereliction of responsibility; a hugely inefficient and costly public sector; some of the most expensive rail and shipping services in the world; a waterfront which still has a substantial distance to go to reach world best practice; a research and development performance which is one of the weakest in the developed world; a system of federal-state financial relations which encourages irresponsibility; a costly and chaotic tax system which is a deadly weight in the saddlebags of Australian business; and, above all, an industrial relations system that has been operated for a powerful few. All these problems should have been tackled by this government, and by this budget, and they were not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanation of the failure of the Hawke-Keating governments is worth considering in some depth. Let us not be partisan about this. There are people of good will on both sides of this parliament. There are people on the other side of the House who know what has to be done; who know what should have been done. There was even a time&mdash;now receding into the distant past&mdash;when the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) seemed to have some understanding of the need for reform. But before the election he declared that the time for reform was finished. He said that the reforms were in place, and it was now just a matter of reaping the benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No one believed it then, and no one believes it now, least of all those people whose task it is to provide the products and the jobs that will enable this country to begin to pay its way again in the world&mdash;the large and small businesses of Australia. They know that the reform process has barely begun; that they are still trying to compete on an un-level playing field; handicapped at every turn by procedures, regulations and institutions for which this government is responsible and which it wilfully refuses to change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why at the last election it was the Liberal and National parties, which honestly faced up to these problems and these needs, which received the overwhelming backing of the business sector both large and small. They recognised that the coalition had done the work, had set out the policies which were best for Australia, and was honest and frank with the people about the task ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alliance with business which Bob Hawke had stitched together at his summit in 1983 had become frayed over the years, and was well and truly shattered by the 1993 election. The disillusion with Labor by business, large and small, was complete. This disillusion deepened after the election when, instead of showing that it had heard the message, the government&mdash;with the traditional vindictiveness of the New South Wales Labor Right&mdash;turned viciously on those business organisations which had the courage, indeed the patriotism, to support those policies which they knew were essential for the survival of this country. They were subjected to the classic politics of threat, which is the only kind of politics that the New South Wales Right and its fellow travellers understand, and as a result the demoralisation of the productive sector in this country deepened even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business investment&mdash;the crucial missing link in our economic recovery&mdash;fell in the June quarter. Since 1989, business investment as a proportion of gross national product has fallen to its lowest level for at least 20 years, while investment in plant and equipment is lower than at any time during the past 40 years. So much for the Prime Minister's much vaunted investment `avalanche'. Without this investment there will be no boost to demand in the short term, no sustainable growth in the medium term, and thus no hope at all in the long term of reducing unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is no novice in politics. He may be a bungler. He may be out of touch. But even he is able to spot a political problem when it hits him in the face, and he knows that Labor has a real problem in reviving business confidence. He also knows&mdash;or at least thinks as much&mdash;that by making the right noises and offering the right platitudes he can buy time. After all, this is the man who told the people that there would be no recession; that Australia was really in a golden age; and that everything was on track. By saying something to the private enterprise sector, he believed that he could give it some heart, some encouragement for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So he hatched upon an idea for reform and decided to tell the business sector that he would extend enterprise bargaining to the non-unionised sector. Many were sceptical. I do not think private enterprise really believed that this would happen, but it welcomed the direction nonetheless. If the Prime Minister had meant it, this would certainly have been an historic event. Seventy per cent of the work force in private enterprise is non-unionised. This was a policy which the coalition had advocated for years, and in putting it forward the government would have received bipartisan support. In fact, pretty well all the reform ideas of the last decade have come from the coalition. The Liberal and National parties have been the parties of ideas in Australian politics for a long time now, and we have always been prepared to be bipartisan, to support reform and to not be dogs in the manger when the government has done something sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why then, with an opposition committed to reform in so many areas, has the government been unable to make the most of these windows of opportunity that the coalition has opened for it? Why has the opportunity for real reform of the labour market now been lost completely? In explaining why reform has not taken place, one fundamental point should be made very clear&mdash;it is not because we on this side of the House oppose it. The opposition has pushed for reform. It has promoted reform. It has said it would support the government in reform. But, no. There has been only token action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real reason lies in the government's relationship with the trade union movement, and the ACTU's privileged position when it comes to policy making. I am in no way disputing the ACTU's legitimate right to participate in policy debates. Through its affiliation with the Labor Party the union movement has, however, gained control of the levers of power to the point where it now exercises a veto over government policy.

A Newspoll published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday showed that support for the Keating republic has slumped, with many more Australians now opposed to the idea than in favour of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far the Prime Minister has been unable to explain precisely why we need constitutional change and how it will make Australia a more democratic, stable and united society than we are today. His so-called minimalist position is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to hide a broader agenda, including an attack on the states, abolishing the Senate, changing the flag and centralising power. Of one thing we can all be certain: none of the pressing problems facing Australia today arise from a defect in our Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my portfolio area of science, technology and export development, the budget is a non-event. The absence of any significant budget initiatives in science and technology result from the government's bungled attempt to form a new national institute of marine science by dismembering the CSIRO and merging it with the Australian Institute of Marine Science. The Minister for Science and Small Business, Senator Schacht, in what was a remarkable display of political ineptitude, tried to bulldoze policy through without consultation and, in the process, alienated the entire science community, members of his own cabinet, the ACTU, the National Fishing Industry Council and a broad range of other industries. The end result was an embarrassing slap in the face for Senator Schacht, his cabinet calling for a complete review of his proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If only the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) had taken more notice of what happens when normal political processes are arrogantly ignored and policy is created behind closed doors and without consultation, he may have avoided the need to consider resigning. The decline in university infrastructure, which makes a mockery of the notion that Australia can become the clever country, has been ignored in the budget. Contrary to the advice of the government's own national board of employment, education and training, which recommended an increase in funding, the status quo remains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms so urgently needed to encourage an upswing in private sector research and development, on which fundamentally our international competitiveness depends, are also sadly lacking. The Bureau of Industry Economics report released since the budget, has highlighted the fact that Australia has been stuck somewhere near the bottom of the OECD ladder since the mid-1980s, in terms of business expenditure on research and development. The report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">R&amp;D, innovation and competitiveness</EMPHASIS> looked at the effectiveness of the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development and concluded that, since its inception, the scheme had not increased the stock of consistent R&amp;D performance. Given the importance of innovation to Australia's economic development, this is cause for considerable alarm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While some initiatives in the budget are aimed at improving our export performance, these fall far short of the recommendations in the McKinsey report. Just as importantly, the budget completely ignores the need to tackle the fundamental structural reforms to which I referred earlier. Without these reforms, Australian business will find it increasingly difficult to compete effectively in export markets. As a result, export growth will continue to fall short of the nation's needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the past few months, this whole budget process has provided accurate insights into the contempt with which this government views the parliament and our democratic process. In a desperate bid to draw attention away from the massive fraud it has perpetrated on people, the Prime Minister and Treasurer have attempted to pin the blame for the budget debacle on anyone but themselves. They have tried to point the finger at the coalition, the Australian Democrats, the Greens and the Senate generally. Both have underestimated the intelligence of the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia know that Labor has broken its promise of no increases in taxation, no new taxes and no increase in the tax burden. They know that the government does not have a mandate for the tax increases proposed in this budget and they know that these increases are only to pay for the tax cuts which were supposed to be l-a-w, law. They also welcome the fact that the coalition will stand firm in its determination to defend their rights and hold the government accountable for its election promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's actions are merely a response to&mdash;they merely voice&mdash;the anger and bitterness expressed by people. An overwhelming 74 per cent of Australians support the Senate in its refusal to pass the tax bills unless they are changed. The Treasurer will never recover from the debacle which has been in this budget. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> pointed out this week, and as even senior ministerial colleagues believe, he is `no longer politically or psychologically equipped to continue as Treasurer'. The paper went on to say that the Treasurer `will become a loose cannon, with potentially devastating effects on Keating's leadership'. It also says, `Already there is leadership discussion within the party'. The Australian people will never forgive the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for this debacle. This week, in this debate, let us simply take note of the betrayals, the backroom deals, the weak leadership and the division that have been the hallmark of this government and this Prime Minister. Let us remember this budget when people once more have the chance to exercise their vote and make their voice heard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address Appropriation Bill (No. 1) with some very stark memories of the week just past. I start with my recollection of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) coming into this parliament to do something that prime ministers must do frequently: deliver a written statement or speech. He has been taking what I believe to be something like 50 per cent more time than a normal person would take to deliver a document, almost stumbling over the words, following them with his finger and demonstrating practically an inability to read. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is smiling; he must not have been watching. It is about time that he and others started watching, if only because I am not citing an isolated incident. I am citing a situation that occurs nearly every time our Prime Minister goes into the public arena to do something on which nobody ever had to check on him before. Other than to read a budget speech, which he had written, and stand up here for a short period, our Prime Minister has never been seen in the public arena delivering a written speech. He has not been doing it with the expertise that one would expect&mdash;and that was certainly displayed by his predecessor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that worried me was that I went out shaking my head and saying to people, `Look, this is not good enough for a Prime Minister. I am embarrassed by what I saw. I am embarrassed by the time that was taken', to have people say, `But don't you know? He never accepts a written brief from his officials. They have to come in and spell it out to him. He can't grasp the written word. Didn't you know that? It has been going on for years'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder why we are here today debating a budget which is a disaster, not only in terms of the words of members of the coalition. We have had questions raised again this week&mdash;stark in my mind&mdash;questioning the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on whether he agreed with, for instance, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), who went back to his electorate to save his own political hide, believing of course that the ANMLS would not report on him. He told his people he was embarrassed, and of course he was. Living even that little distance from a major population centre, he is aware of the increased burdens and the very foolish approach that this particular budget brings to the Australian people. It is all put in the wrong places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an interesting point because, having had all that in my mind and having had a look at just some of the basic statistics of the budget, I was reminded of a document I read once. I read it at a Rotary meeting because its members had it on the wall. It is something that is very important to Rotary clubs. They call it the four-way test. It is a test they put to themselves, and it is a test that they believe in. Considering that Rotary in particular, as a service club, is oriented towards business and vocational activities, it is a test that its members put down upon themselves in the business arena. I thought it would not be a bad idea to have a few of those tests posted around the walls of this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are four questions, as honourable members would imagine, in the four-way test of the things we think, say or do. These are the things we should ask ourselves before we do those things. The first of those questions is: is it the truth? The second is: is it fair to all concerned? The third&mdash;of some importance, I would think, to politicians&mdash;is: will it build goodwill and better friendships? The fourth is: will it be beneficial to all concerned?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought I might slide that test over the budget for a minute. Is it the truth? Clearly, it is not. We have had the Treasurer moralising here when we said to him today, `You are whingeing about people not getting their tax cuts for Christmas, but we will fix that for you today. Just ring them up in the Senate. Tell your people to vote for what is now Budget Deficit (Reduction) Bill'&mdash;or whatever they call it&mdash;`mark 3, and we will pass it. They will get their tax cuts even earlier'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I predict that it will be passed on Tuesday anyway. I do not know whether the Treasurer will then come in here, crying his crocodile tears about the Christmas stocking&mdash;and I want to come back to that. But every time he gives us that lecture about economic and fiscal responsibility, I am tempted&mdash;I make the point `tempted' only&mdash;to interject upon him and say, `Why didn't you tell the people all these words before the election? Why didn't you say to them before the election that you couldn't have personal tax cuts unless you had a massive burden of indirect taxes dumped upon you?'. Why did not government members apply the first principle of that four-way test, and say to people, `Well, we don't like the approach of the Liberals to an indirect tax. We want to keep the old one, but you are going to have to live with the simple fact that, to give you those tax cuts we said we could deliver under One Nation and that we have put into l-a-w, you are going to have to cop some other taxes'. Why did they not do it? Why did they not take that first test: is it the truth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then of course we get down to the question: is it fair to all concerned? I think that is pretty important. Let us have a look at some of the aspects of fairness. The Treasurer, again, has been telling us how there is going to be all these magnificent presents for Christmas by way of personal tax cuts. I went and got hold of the statistics, as provided by the Treasurer in his budget papers, and I found the figure of $20,900. It is not $20,700 because the statistics do not happen to give me that figure. I also found that over 44 per cent of all taxpayers have a taxable income of less than $20,700. Of course, according to these wonderful new tax rules&mdash;and, might I add, the One Nation tax promise&mdash;they get nothing. They will get no personal tax cuts but, yes, they are to get a rebate. It was to be $100, but the government did a bit of a deal with the Democrats and gave them a lousy extra $1 a week. But when do they get the rebate? It will not be in time for Christmas. It is not to be provided for this Christmas, and some of them will still be waiting for it next Christmas. I tell honourable members, it will buy a lot of presents for the kids! It will not even pay, in that period, for the extra that people will pay for their petrol. So they are the first group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at those who earn less than $25,000, we find that a figure in excess of 57 per cent of taxpayers are in that category, and the best the entire 57 per cent can hope for, by way of a reduction in their income tax, is $3.30. That is for those right up near the $25,000 mark, and others get less. So I ask again: is it fair to all concerned that all those people will get no personal tax compensation or practically nothing? In fact, across the board, I suppose it will be $3. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no dispute of the fact that it is these people who still have those motor cars with leaded engines that were inefficient, by modern day standards, when they were put in the cars. Of course, they are doubly inefficient today. We are not only talking about the type of fuel they use, but the fact that they use a lot more of it to travel a kilometre. Those people of course get no relief from the government's decision to increase fuel by 3c a litre and with the additional 2c a litre lined up for next year, just to toughen up the next Christmas a little bit more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a cynical exercise it is, considering the volatility of fuel prices, to bring those budget requirements from next year into this budget. We know why the government did it. It is just another way to deceive because, at the time when those taxes are applied, a person seeing petrol prices vary by 7c and 8c in a week will not know who gets the money. That is what this government was counting on with this long-term projection. It has nothing to do with long-term projection. One has only to have a look at the government's performance in terms of its deficits. I do not think it has got one budget outcome right in history. Some were better, some were worse. A couple of years ago, it was to be a $4.5 billion deficit and it came out $10 billion. It does not know where it is. It does not seem to be able to manage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have told honourable members, we have a Prime Minister who cannot even read a written brief. He cannot sit down and absorb anything. He has to have it explained to him. He is rushed into the parliament and says it quickly, in case he forgets. Pump him up with J-curve, non-farm deflator and he will go for about five or six hours. After that, we would not know what he would do. He cannot manage. He is really and truly missing Bob Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the simple facts when we ask ourselves: is it fair to all concerned? Is it fair to families earning less than $25,000&mdash;50 per cent plus, nearly 60 per cent of Australia's taxpayers&mdash;to tell them that they get nothing by way of tax cuts? In fact, they must pay all this extra for their fuel when they have the most fuel-inefficient vehicles of the lot. What sort of a Christmas present is it to say to the kids, `I am sorry. I was going to take you to that lovely spot we know of a few hundred kilometres away but, because of the federal budget, our potential to travel has been reduced substantially and, I am sorry, we cannot go.'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it goes further than that because some of the families in that category are also small business people, people for whom I have a responsibility, and a substantial number of them own trucks. The Australian trucking industry is noted for the fact that many of its participants are owner-drivers, the epitome of a family small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has this measure done for owner-drivers? The increased taxes have put up the average cost of operating a truck from $1,000 a week to $1,200. Truck drivers could try to negotiate an increased fee with their clients and, if they are lucky, the costs will shunt through. As the Road Transport Forum, a very reputable group in road transport circles, has told us, that will add about an extra $3 to the cost of a typical grocery basket. That is the sort of cost that will flow through from the decision to increase fuel charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people though are not that lucky. Government members have been telling us today how wonderful things will be in Victoria as a result of this budget. Victoria, more than any other state, is the manufacturing state. It is a state that is very vulnerable to import competition. The government&mdash;I am not particularly critical of this decision&mdash;has set the parameters for import competition. They get tougher every year as tariffs are lowered. But none of these taxes hit foreigners importing into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They send their goods in international ships, and where do they land them? On the very doorstep of the two great population centres of Australia&mdash;Melbourne and Sydney. All these people delivering food, clothing and commodities, be they Brazilian orange juice producers, Turkish dried fruit producers or Chinese manufacturers of clothing, just to name a few, are all coming into the country and competing, in particular with the people of Victoria. Yet we were told today by one government member that Victoria has never had it so good under a federal budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have to absorb all these extra taxes.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that they are the taxes that people have to pay even when they are going broke. Numerous small businesses are not incorporated companies. Probably less than a quarter of the real mums and dads type of small businesses are incorporated. They do not get the benefit of the much lauded 6c in the dollar drop in company tax. That is for all the big boys who have been declaring such wonderful profits after tax in recent times. The little guys are not paying much tax because they are not making any profits in this recession we had to have. So where are they? There is an increase in all the taxes on the things they use and no offsetting tax personally and no offsetting tax in the corporate structure. How can that be fair to all concerned? How can that be right? It amazes me that these sorts of things happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can read those opposite like a book. They all get together and put the words in place. I remember when they were first elected: they all trotted out the same words one after another. They are all given their lines and learn them like nursery rhymes. To a degree, it is very effective in a political sense, but we always know what they are up to. They have been running around moralising about whose fault it is that people are not getting tax cuts when the fault is clearly theirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have also gone around spouting their lines on a few other subjects. The Prime Minister has been telling us that Graham Blight, the head of the NFF, does not like us any more. What the Prime Minister did not tell us is that Graham Blight does not like us because he believes we should also oppose the personal tax cuts. I have that in black and white. All the Prime Minister said was that Graham Blight does not like us anymore. The truth is that he does not like us because we have said yes. The government had a mandate to cut people's taxes. It did not have a mandate to increase the price of fuel, the price of all goods subject to sales tax and the price of wine. The simple fact is that the government will not get away with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Blight's quite proper solution is the purely economic one of knocking off the taxes which he knows will kill his constituency&mdash;the farmers and others. How would honourable members like to be producing orange juice in Mildura and having to send it down to Melbourne to compete with the Brazilians. The Brazilians' costs have not increased a cent on account of this budget but, of course, the poor old Mildurians have to pay another $200 a week per semitrailer to get their product into the same market. What a joke!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister wants to quote us half of Mr Blight's remarks. I have Mr Blight's letter, so I know what he wants. I know why he is criticising, and he will have to keep on criticising. He would do a better job if he got on with representing the farmers instead of trying to run the country. I am fed up with paying him my dues. He seems to want to give all my money to economists. The National Farmers Federation seems to be more interested as an organisation in righting the budget than in representing the very legitimate interests of the individual farmers who are not going too well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consider fairness and benefit, as laid down in the Rotary four-way test, the whole situation is amazing. Let us look at a few things straight out of the budget paper. It says inflation is to rise 3.5 per cent and unemployment is to stay at 10.75 per cent. The current account balance of payments is a mere $18 billion, of which this government proposes to borrow $16 billion. The minister is telling us about how his government will take on the responsibility for compensation claims resulting from the Mabo ruling. With what? Has he done a calculation under the fairness rule to decide who will lose a hospital or a school when he gives that money away? Or is he going to materialise it? Has it worked out a new system, or is he just one of those who believes two plus two equals six. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not mind how he does it, it is just that the budget papers tell us that the government proposes to borrow $16 billion this year and meanwhile the Prime Minister is saying, `I made the states a generous offer. I said I'll pick up the compensation'. What will he do&mdash;sell his pig farm? Of course he will not. He expects the Australian people to find that money even if it means losing hospitals or sacking school teachers&mdash;services which would be of better value to them. That is the sort of debt we are looking at. It is absolutely ridiculous and I cannot understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, in a press release on national savings, the ANZ Bank told us about the superannuation scheme and how it will increase national savings. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANZ Saving Report shows that in trend terms, national saving fell by 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product or $1.2 billion in the June quarter, 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the largest quarterly fall in national saving since the ANZ series commenced in 1974 and ends recent hopes that national savings had begun to stabilise.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister might want to tell us how that compensation money will be found in that situation. It appears the government will not rob the savings of Australians. They do not have savings. They are having to use it to pay for their petrol and the increased cost of buying their kids Christmas presents when in fact the government will not give most of them any tax cut anyway. The people who will get the cuts will probably be those who least need them. It is an outrageous situation. </PARA>

The big fella despised Ben Chifley to the extent that he held a long-time grudge. And why was this the case? It was because Chifley had the strength of character to stand up to the tyrant, and this bitter man, Lang, wanted to repay his personal vendetta to Chifley and his policies by getting even. To the good fortune of Australia, Lang was given short shrift from public life and denied the opportunity of wreaking his revenge, but this poor, bitter man was so frustrated with his lack of worth that he told those who would listen of the correctness of his own policies&mdash;policies based on ego, poor management and disgrace. </PARA>

Thank you for your empathy to the Australian people. Thank you for being divisive and belligerent. Thank you for setting Australian against Australian.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and to reflect what has been said by members on this side of the House about a budget, the receipt of which has been met with nothing but scorn from the people around Australia. No matter where we look for an opinion on the 1993 budget, we find people who are indignant about its impact on their lifestyle&mdash;not merely indignant from a selfish point of view, but indignant because they recognise that this budget fails to address the major problems faced by Australia and fails to provide the opportunity for some sort of renewal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of scorn has been heaped on members of the opposition by those opposite because of our decision to oppose just three sectors of the budget. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will be aware from the speeches delivered, we chose to oppose the rise in wholesale sales tax, to oppose the changes in fuel excise, to oppose the changes in the sales tax on wine and to oppose the retrospective implications that the budget has in the areas of long service leave and holiday leave loading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Such action affected in total barely two per cent of budget outlays. But the opposite side of the House has created the impression that would lead one to believe our intention was to block the budget and frustrate the government. Barely two per cent of budget outlays are affected by the changes proposed by the opposition. Why have we taken this bold and unprecedented, but responsible, step? Because the government cannot claim a mandate for the changes it proposed in the 1993 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For telling it as it is, we, the opposition, lost an election. In that same election, the government failed to indicate to the people of Australia that it was the intention of the ALP to make these sorts of changes in a budget to be handed down within four months of the 13 March poll. The government gave no inkling to the people of Australia that it proposed the sorts of dramatic tax hikes that have been a part of this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government did indicate to the people of Australia that they could reasonably expect tax cuts&mdash;and we recognise that. Because the tax cuts had been legislated for, as the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) knows&mdash;l-a-w, law&mdash;we chose what for us was an uncomfortable, but responsible, course of allowing those tax cuts to go through. But those particular tax imposts which have been so unfair on Australians we chose to oppose without frustrating the direction the government was taking. So in the areas of fuel, wine, retrospective tax on long service leave and holiday leave loading, we, the opposition, have taken the principled stand of opposing these measures without frustrating the government because less than two per cent of the budget revenue is affected by these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of the remarks uttered by the President of the NFF, Mr Graham Blight, in response to the opposition's stance on the budget. Mr Blight made these remarks at a conference convened by the Australian farm management society during the royal show in Adelaide. The one claim to fame that I, as a member of the House of Representatives, can make is that, unlike any other member of the House of Representatives, I was there. I heard Mr Blight say what he said about the opposition and naturally I stood up somewhat indignant and rebuffed his argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I also heard from Mr Blight at the same conference, which was never acknowledged by the Prime Minister, was the criticism he levelled at the government. Certainly he was unhappy with the opposition, but not because we had chosen to oppose the sales tax increases, not because we had chosen to refuse to pass the increase in the wine tax, and not because we had chosen to refuse the changes in fuel excise; he was unhappy that we had not taken the additional step of opposing the tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imagine how indignant he was at a government that had proposed all of those increases and proposed the tax cuts. For the Prime Minister to claim any mandate from the President of the NFF is totally erroneous. The truth is that, while the President of the NFF may have been less than fulsome in his praise of the opposition, he was far more critical&mdash;not surprisingly&mdash;of the government over its budget direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He reflected what has been the universal criticism of the people of Australia. Mr Graham Blight's constituents and my constituents are largely the same people. They are also the constituents shared by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). They, of course, are indignant at the fuel impost and at the increased cost of production in rural Australia as a result of the changes to fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the people who cannot afford the change to unleaded vehicles. These are the people from areas in which lead pollution has a minimal impact and these are the people who are being obliged by this government to pay the cost of what is largely an urban problem. More than that, they cannot make the change and so they are forced to change their already crippled lifestyle, as mentioned by the honourable member for Parkes, in order to accommodate what has been this government's budget obsession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fuel tax is clearly a regressive tax. It flows through the entire cost of production in Australia. I noted that, following the budget announcement, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> brought out an advertisement in which it made the point that shopping trolleys run on diesel, simply because the impact of the fuel excise on the price of goods in any shopping trolley was calculated, not by the opposition but by the Road Transport Forum, as being somewhere in the vicinity of $2 to $3. That average of $2 to $3 in additional costs is borne by every consumer in Australia, no matter what their task. So every consumer needs to take out of the Australian economy an additional $2 or $3. When we multiply that we appreciate just how regressive this tax is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Parkes mentioned, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has been so anxious to create the impression that we are the people denying Australians the opportunity for a merry Christmas when effectively it has been his budget and his budget strategy which has made the delivery of these income tax cuts so difficult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there has been universal indignation about this budget and its impact, nowhere has it been spelt out more clearly than in the wine industry that is so much a part of my electorate. I make the point, which I made in response to the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) this morning, that if ALP members truly claimed to represent their electorates they would be standing up and saying what opposition members are saying about the impact of this tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to be unkind to the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), who is a charitable colleague of mine, but I gather that he has been much more outspoken in his electorate than he has been in the House. In fact, he has failed to represent the interests of his electors in spelling out just what this 55 per cent hike in wine tax will do to his electorate. I am acutely aware of what it is doing to his electorate because the same impact is being felt in mine. Why is it that the voices being raised in protest about this tax are solely those on this side of the House, echoing not some sort of prejudicial view expressed by the opposition but echoing instead what constituents right across Australia are saying to us all?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate this morning the honourable member for Lilley was anxious to make much of what he saw as equity in the tax system as a result of changes to the wine tax and anxious to make much of what he saw as the failure of the wine industry to pay its share of taxation when compared to the brewers or the spirits manufacturers. Equity in tax! Is there any comparison to be made between the wine industry&mdash;which is in itself a labour intensive industry and, frankly, which is calculated to have more value adding built into it than any other primary industry; an industry which has become the benchmark for export development&mdash;and the spirits and brewing industries? Of course there is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does it take to get into the wine industry? It takes a block of land, trellising, the planting of vines to a particular root stock and a delay of between five and 10 years to get into a production which is large enough to ensure that the debt incurred has been met. That is not the end. Having done all of that, the grapes are picked and processed in a labour intensive way, carefully blended and placed in a bottle to be matured for another three to five years, making a total delay of something like seven to 10 years before a real return can be felt in a quality wine product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does that compare with the brewing industry which is nothing more than the annual crop of hops added to the annual crop of barley with a dose of water, probably on a monthly basis, to produce a product that can be brewed, or the spirits industry, the resource of which is frequently waste product? There ought to be no comparison for tax equity between the wine industry and the beer and spirits industries. After all, our major competitors in Europe make no such comparison. They deliberately favour the wine industries in their countries. Any quick glance at statistics will reveal that the major European wine producers are not taxing their wine at the level that Australian wine is currently being taxed, without the 55 per cent impost by this government in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been calculated that by the year 2000 the 55 per cent impost in wine tax proposed by the government in the August 1993 budget will raise something like $700 million. If one adds to it the tax revenue that the government is already scraping out of the wine industry, by the year 2000 the wine industry will have contributed the sum of $2 billion to the government coffers in Australia. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only is that more than the growers get, as the honourable member for Parkes quite rightly interjects, but more incredibly, the export target for the wine industry for the year 2000 is the export of $1 billion worth of product. So, if this government stays on its course, by the year 2000 the wine industry will have generated for the government twice as much as it will produce in export income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the honourable member for Lilley to think again just what tax equity is all about. Nor should he accuse the opposition, in his desperate desire for tax equity, of in some way falsely protecting the wine industry from the reality of meeting its responsibility in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are the people who went into opposition leaving behind a wine industry that had no sales tax and no excise. We went into opposition in the face of statements from a former Prime Minister, who said in Griffith in the electorate of the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), `There will be no tax on wine'. As the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) knows, it did not take long for that promise to be reversed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We took the responsible view of recognising that, if the wine industry was an industry with an alcohol base, it was not unreasonable for it to carry some tax. While we expressed our indignation at the rate at which this government overthrew its pre-election promise, nonetheless we tolerated a tax of up to 20 per cent, believing there was some equity in that. However, it is totally indefensible to lift the tax by 55 per cent from 20 per cent to 31 per cent in one fell swoop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today the honourable member for Lilley went on to say that this tax rise would not affect the wine industry because the industry's principal growth area is exports and, after all, exports do not carry the sales tax. I could not believe that he could take such a blinkered view of an industry that is principally Australian and has become the benchmark for export development. On what does the honourable member imagine the wine industry has been built? It has been built on the quality of its domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time we make it difficult to build a domestic base we make it harder to make inroads into an export base. Every time we frustrate the development of quality wine in the domestic industry we reduce the base from which we have to export. We need quality wine in Australia to continue to fuel export development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of this budget will be to reduce the base of quality wine in Australia, to force up the cost of production in Australia and to make it more difficult for the industry to get into export markets. Is this rumour-mongering? Is this just a case of the opposition running around conveniently in South Australia making a difficult case? If it is, I ask the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley): why is it the case that is also being expressed by the ALP Premier of South Australia, Premier Arnold? Why is it that the wineries in South Australia and across Australia have since the budget faced a major downturn in wine sales?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I spoke to the representatives of two wineries in my electorate, expecting that perhaps there had been a 30 per cent downturn in wine sales, and found that, in one case, the downturn had been estimated at 50 per cent and, in the other case, at 60 per cent. The major winemaker whose sales had fallen by 60 per cent since the impact of the budget said to me, `Do you know what this is costing me?'. And consider this, Mr Deputy Speaker, in view of the location of your electorate: he said, `I employ over 30 people in my sales arm in Sydney. And, with sales falling by 60 per cent, every one of their jobs is at risk'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The longer the government goes on delaying what is effectively a decision on the wine tax the longer it protracts this whole uncertainty about the wine industry. It is too easy for the government to simply blame the opposition for what it sees as the frustrated package of the wine tax measures. This opposition has not moved one iota on its opposition to wine tax and neither, so far as I am aware over the last week, have the Australian Democrats nor the Greens. There is nothing preventing the Treasurer, in the interests of the Australian wine industry, simply removing this legislation and so allowing certainty to return to the wine industry, the sales base to grow once again and the export base to grow as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in some comments that I made in the House earlier today, if we are indignant at the impact of a 55 per cent increase in the sales tax base for wine, every Australian ought to join us in making an even louder noise about the little matter that has been largely forgotten in this parliament and largely overlooked. Given the influence that the Leader of the House has in government policy making, I bring directly to his attention the impact not only of a 55 per cent sales tax on wine but the astonishing impact of a decision by the government in the budget to raise the tax on dealcoholised wine from 10 per cent to 21 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a 110 per cent increase on a product that does absolutely no harm to the Australian community and is largely used as a healthy alternative for those who find that they are intolerant of alcohol. This 110 per cent increase applies to product with an alcohol rating of under 1.15 per cent. Most of that product has an alcohol rating of under .05 per cent. What is the reaction of the government? It raises the tax on that product by 110 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most charitable view that could be taken is that this may have been an unintended consequence of the government's obsession with taxation. If I am going to be that charitable there is no reason why the government should not choose to reverse this decision because it generates little in income and frankly does nothing but frustrate what is a developing part of Australia's primary industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the opposition I implore the government to pick up that two per cent of the budget that we have found so frustrating that it has deserved our indignation, to amend that two per cent and allow the budget's rapid passage in the interests of the people of Australia and the certainty of the Australian wine industry.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been an amazing few weeks since the budget was delivered in the middle of August. It was an amazing budget inasmuch as within 24 hours it was rejected and members of the government were leaving the ships like rats down a drainpipe. My colleague made reference to two of those members and what they did: the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan). I think that was fairly typical of what was going on amongst the back bench of the Labor Party when it realised what an absolute disaster this particular budget was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a fact that publications were going out in the electorate of Hunter completely disowning the budget. Like Eric the Red, he was ploughing the fields, telling them how he had stood up to this terrible government and fought those budget measures, but he is not here tonight. We had exactly the same thing in the electorate of Lilley in Brisbane. Like the little petal that he is, the honourable member for Lilley was prancing around the place saying that he had fought the good fight and had got all these changes in the budget. But when they come in here, of course, that bravado is not there because they are under the thumb of this government which is prepared to press on with what can only be described as draconian measures in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One really does wonder how much the government has thought it through. We heard the story of the wine industry just recently. We heard the story of the increased tax on fuel. We have heard the claims of government members, and from the Australian Democrats as to how they have saved the nation and people will not be paying as much for their fuel. But, in actual fact, all that those people have succeeded in doing is putting an extra 7c per litre on the price of fuel. As my colleague mentioned just a few minutes ago, the flow-on effect of that throughout industry in Australia is absolutely enormous. </PARA>

We have seen the imposition of taxation regimes on about the only export industry that has the capacity to provide big numbers of jobs for Australians; that has the capacity to provide big numbers in terms of foreign income for Australians. Of course, it is doing everything it can to make sure that that industry cannot get off its back. It does so through the fuel tax, which is being passed on all the way down the line. Not only the transport operators, but the bus operators and the cruise ship operators are all paying more tax and that is going to be forwarded on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most outstanding debacle that has ever been put up was the imposition of the fringe benefits tax on business travel and what that is going to do to the industry. I really wonder which intellectual giant, if any, thought that one through. It is very interesting when one talks to government members that one cannot find where the idea came from. Did it come from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)? Apparently, in Monte Carlo, he was denying too much knowledge of it. Does it come from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)? Maybe; we will never know. Did it come from the bureaucracy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It did not take too long for the industry to realise what a dreadful impact that was going to have. We look through those budget papers and see all these suggestions as to how public service rates were going to be applied. Nobody must have read the book, because when we went through that taxation ruling on the public service travel allowance, we found that there were literally dozens of permutations and combinations that could be applied in trying to calculate what the tax was going to be. That was pointed out to the government and, of course, it backed down on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It came up the other day&mdash;and this is how good it really is&mdash;with this brand new solution that we will have this flat rate across the board. It was implied that the rate may start at $300 a day. Of course, Access Economics did its homework on that and found that if that was applied in that manner, the most likely outcome would be that the government would get no income whatsoever under the fringe benefits tax arrangements. In fact, the revenue might decline. In the meantime, an industry has come to a stop when it realised that if this tax came in, it would be in big and desperate trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly than that, I believe that the young people of Australia are in deep and desperate trouble. I think it has been fairly well established through the official studies that there are going to be at least 10,000 jobs lost in the tourism and hospitality industry if this particular measure proceeds. That would mean 10,000 young people would be looking at losing their jobs. But what about the thousands&mdash;and there are now thousands&mdash;of young people in the tourism and hospitality colleges around Australia who are training with the hope that they will be able to get into this industry; that they will have a career path in a growth industry, in an industry that is full of fun&mdash;</PARA>

The government may do that, but what it is going to do to the domestic industry is cripple it, because under this particular arrangement, one of the first things that is going to be shot to pieces is the whole convention market in Australia. If the government is going to apply all these taxes across the board, what is going to happen? The convention organisers are going to go offshore; they will take their business elsewhere. It would be a physical impossibility for this government to try to estimate exactly what the expenditure might be in such exotic locations as Bali, Singapore, Fiji or Thailand and it will lose that whole sector of the industry. Is that not crazy?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been enormous investment in convention centres in Melbourne and Sydney. The Queensland state government in its budget just a few weeks ago allocated $75 million for the construction of a convention centre in Brisbane and for assistance for a convention centre in Cairns. We build these crystal cathedrals on our shores and they will remain absolute tombs; nobody will go there, because the government is taxing them out of all creation. They have gone offshore; they have taken their money with them and run. Those buildings sit there derelict. More importantly, the young kids of Australia have not got a job. That is an appalling situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we get those limits that are being proposed into the system, what do we see around Australia? One of the things that I think this government can be justly proud of over the last decade has been the construction of some world-class hotels. I defy anybody to say these days that we do not stack up with some of the major overseas destinations in the quality of the hotels and the service that we provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These major hotels, after all, are being used by the top end of the market; they are being used by international visitors. Their bread and butter is still coming out of business travel in Australia and their yields have been dreadful in recent times because of the economic downturn and the recession. What are they going to do? They are going to have to fit in with a price, so the prices come down. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a rule of thumb that the cost of a hotel room per night is about one per cent of the cost of the construction of the room. The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) knows as well as I do that the cost of room construction at one of the new hotels in Sydney was $850,000 per unit. He might also be aware that the overnight cost at the moment to try to get some business is about $180 a night. Honourable members should look at some of the older hotels in Australia where the rooms were costing $250,000 dollars to build. What returns are they getting now? In one of the big chains the government rate is $92 a night. They have come down as far as that. If we get this tax imposed on the system, we will see those rates pushed down and down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To stay afloat, those hotels will have to make some very big adjustments. The first adjustment that they will make is to off-load staff. The estimates around Australia are that 10,000 jobs will go. Australia enjoys an enviable reputation in world terms as a tourist destination. At the moment I think our properties and the service that we provide stack up against almost anything around the world. But that level of service, because of what the government is doing, will have to decline. We will see those standards come down, the prices for those international visitors will come down, and that will flow all the way through the whole industry. The big losers will be the three-star hotels, and the other great losers will be the mum's and dad's hotels and motels. People do not realise in Australia that, while we talk about the tourist industry and while we pay due respect to the five-star properties at the top end of the market, the reality is that about 92 per cent of the tourist industry in Australia is made up of small business. They are the ones that we will hurt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members can see what has happened around Australia in recent times. In places like Cairns, the Gold Coast or even Sydney, the high occupancy rates are in the top end of the market. The minister's reference to the number of overseas visitors is quite true. The possibility of getting a hotel room in Cairns these days at the top end of the market is pretty slim. Cairns probably needs another three five-star hotels over the next couple of years. Even the Gold Coast will need to require more properties. The lower end of the market&mdash;the mum's and dad's motels&mdash;has had the worst year on record. A lot of that is because of the economic downturn. The government will help that along even more because it has just whacked a bit more onto the fuel tax. We have seen, especially in the case of the Gold Coast and its Victorian market, which was an important one over the years, that the Victorians are not travelling much further north than the border. While places like Bega and Merimbula are doing quite well at the moment, the real reason is that people are not travelling as far. A lot of room stock will be crippled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a crazy situation if the whole of Australia has to take a downturn in its standards because of the short-sighted stupidity evident in this government's imposition of those fringe benefits tax arrangements. It flows right the way through the industry. We have talked about the conventions; we have talked about the hotels. We saw what happened initially when fringe benefits were applied to restaurants. Nobody denies that all sorts of tricks were going on in terms of claiming for restaurant meals. The government, in its imitable style in the mid-1980s, knocked the whole thing on the head with a sledgehammer and we saw restaurants going out of business all over the place. It has taken a long time and a great restructure of those restaurants for them to come back. While we have some restaurants at the top end of the market, there are not as many there now as there usually were. The standard or nature of restaurants has gone down-market. What is euphemistically called the family restaurant is now picking up a great deal of the business. We have lost the tradition of the silver service restaurants that we had before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With these provisions in the original proposal, people will be able to claim something like $50 a day for three meals if they are travelling interstate. That would see that industry decline even further. As one of my hoteliers told me, if people are trying to make a profit in this game in some of the luxury hotels in Australia, $50 would not even buy a sandwich. That is probably pretty right. I suppose it is all right for the government to think that the business travellers of Australia can stay at the YMCA and buy themselves a bowl of rice, if they are lucky, for lunch and another one for dinner. That is really what the government is talking about. We are losing all that tradition and investment that we have had in the hospitality industry. We have seen a decline in the number of the top of the market restaurants, but the government wants to go even further. Government members get up here and trumpet their huge successes in international tourism; they trumpet how they have been the only ones who have ever really made any effort to build the industry in Australia. But nobody thought this proposal through. All they are interested in is knocking this industry on the head and getting these stupid socialistic principles into place&mdash;principles at the end of the day which will see one thing happen, and that is the decline in the number of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not too late for the government to change its budget strategies. It is not too late for it to go out and say that the wine tax is absolutely stupid and it will get rid of that; we will really affect our export industries if we maintain this stupid arrangement with the increase in the fuel tax; and it really will be a crazy situation if we wreck the hotel and the hospitality industry through the fringe benefits taxes. If the government had any intestinal fortitude it would go in and make the hard decisions, realising that it has made some dreadful mistakes and should change the situation. How many versions of the budget have we had so far? Three or four. I am sure that mark 5 would be welcomed if it contained some sensible arrangements and was thought through, and these particular impositions which will have a disastrous effect on some sections of our industry were taken out altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are cynical about politicians at the moment. They are terribly cynical about what went on before the last election. They are terribly cynical about the implications of this particular budget. We cannot blame them. They were misled right the way through the election. The government went into the election on a fear campaign, and fear it was. The fear within the Australian community was generated in that budget just over six weeks ago. It is a disaster for Australia. The kindest thing that the government could possibly do would be to withdraw the budget altogether and try to start again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the House to the economic vandalism being inflicted on the people of New South Wales by the coalition government of Premier John Fahey. In a state with one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia, the New South Wales government continues to underspend its capital works program. It has also cut 10,000 jobs in its recent state budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the last federal election in March this year, it was revealed that the Fahey government was underspending its capital works budget by up to $300 million. This was clearly designed to slow down economic growth and employment growth in the lead-up to the federal election so that the federal government would not get political credit for its job creating capital works initiatives such as One Nation and the local capital works program, which delivered over $100 million to New South Wales councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find that the Fahey government has made further cuts of over $200 million in this financial year on top of last year's cuts. This means a reduction of 4.2 per cent on capital works in real terms, which will cost over 4,000 jobs. Add this to the public sector job cuts totalling 3,500 in key authorities, including Elcom, the Water Board, Hunter Water and the SRA, as well as over 2,000 further job cuts in government departments, and we have more than 10,000 jobs down the drain. This is despite the fact that the federal government grants to New South Wales increased by $288 million in addition to the $100 million direct funding to the local government under the local capital works program. Yet the Fahey government has the hide to blame lack of federal funding for the state's problems. All that is happening is that Fahey is pocketing federal funding grants and reducing his own government's contribution to capital works so that he can save up to buy the next state election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particular example of this dishonesty is evident in health funding. The Fahey government's hype about increases to health funding is a giant fraud. In fact, most of the increased funding is Commonwealth money and the New South Wales government's contribution has dropped in real terms. One has only to look in my electorate of Macarthur for evidence of the Fahey government's disgraceful record in health funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991-92 hospital funding in south-west Sydney was cut by $10 million to $214 million. Hospitals covered by the south-west Sydney area health service had productivity cuts of $4.7 million, and $1.7 million was withheld from the redevelopment of Liverpool hospital. If the south-west Sydney area health service were funded properly, it would get an extra $110 million&mdash;in other words, 50 per cent more than it currently gets. At Camden hospital in my electorate, staffing levels for nurses are dangerously low, but the administration still has to hand back funds to the state government as `savings'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nursing staff at Camden hospital have become so concerned about staffing levels and staff morale that they have asked their union to intervene. The maternity unit is a classic example. Even though the hospital's own protocol requires two staff in the delivery suite at any time, often only one nurse is rostered on of an evening. Recently, in the post- and ante-natal wards there have been only one nurse and one aide looking after 28 patients. The staff are scared of losing their jobs if they complain about the situation, and they are also scared of losing the lives of patients if they do not complain about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 the state coalition government under Nick Greiner closed the children's ward at the Camden hospital. The Camden area in the Macarthur electorate is the fastest growing area in New South Wales, with the youngest population. Half the population is under the age of 20. What does the state government do? It closes the children's ward at the hospital. Goodness gracious, what an absolute farce and what an indictment on a state liberal government in New South Wales. The government closed hospital services, closed beds and closed a children's ward in an area with the fastest growth and the youngest population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the other effects of the Fahey government's health cuts are as follows. Victims of sexual assault wait up to 12 months for counselling and five-month waits are common. There is the lack of a safe house for the victims of sexual assault and programs to challenge the social attitudes that allow sexual assault to occur. There is a lack of health facilities in the fast growing Bargo-Tahmoor-Picton area. There are 3,200 patients on waiting lists for surgery and there is an increase of about 13 per cent a year in waiting lists. There are 16,000 patients on waiting lists for dentistry and they are forced to wait between 18 months and three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Liverpool hospital, amongst many others, is threatened with privatisation. There were 20 beds cut from hospitals in the south-west Sydney area in 1991-92, and bed levels in south-west Sydney are 15 per cent below the New South Wales average.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to record a brief tribute to a man who died 60 years ago on 8 October 1933. The anniversary of his death is one week from tomorrow. Harry Holland was born at Gungahlin outside present Canberra in 1868. As a young journalist, he worked on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queanbeyan Times</EMPHASIS>. His father was a farm labourer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Holland never received the recognition he deserved for his contribution to the development of the Australian and New Zealand Labour parties and their socialist traditions. Harry Holland moved to Sydney in 1887 and met and married Annie McLachlan, whom he had met at a Salvation Army meeting. In 1892, faced with the need to support his family by delivering newspapers seven days a week, including Sunday, he left the Salvation Army because he could not maintain its principle of not working on the Sabbath. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His emotional concern for the welfare of people and his reaction against the hardship and deprivation associated with the Depression and the industrial conflict of the 1890s led him into the Australian Socialist League, which also included moderates such as W.A. Holman, Billy Hughes and George Black. He accepted the view of Sydney Webb that socialism is not an elaborate plan of society, but a principle of social action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Holland and his friend Tom Batho became newspaper publishers. They moved to Newcastle in 1896 and occupied two semi-detached cottages facing the railway coal tip. They published the socialist paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern People</EMPHASIS>. Holland and his family had no furniture and little food. He often suffered malnutrition to feed his family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1898, Holland left the Labor Party when it retreated from its socialist objective. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Sydney and later founded the Socialist Labor Party. After a temporary flirtation with Labor Party publications, he returned to militant socialism and began to publish the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">International Socialist Review for Australasia</EMPHASIS> in Sydney 1907. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then followed an intense period of writing and trade union activity, during which his socialist thinking matured. Harry Holland firmed a friendship with Tom Mann, the militant English trade unionist, who came out to Melbourne in 1903. He was influenced by the Wobblies, or the Industrial Workers of the World, which was formed in Chicago in 1905. He became the general secretary of the Socialist Federation of Australasia in 1907. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Harry Holland and Tom Mann were prominent activists in the 1909 strike of the Broken Hill miners. One of the slogans of the Broken Hill miners in 1909 was, `Better a dead belly than an empty one'. Holland and Mann were arrested during the Broken Hill strike. Holland was charged with sedition when he advocated the use of dynamite to release his friend Tom Mann and declared that if the police used rifles on the workers, they should reciprocate with Gatling guns. He was sentenced to two years gaol. Holland was also a friend of Peter Bowling, the leader of the Newcastle coalminers, who was placed in leg irons after his arrest for leading the Newcastle miners strike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Harry Holland once declared his vision to be the highest form of Christianity, where men should be so fully developed and live in such a state it would not be necessary for human laws to rule them. Holland and the militant socialists were dispirited by the defeat of the 1910 coalminers strike in Newcastle and his poor results in the electorate of West Sydney where he stood for election to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Harry Holland was invited to conduct a lecture tour of New Zealand. He arrived there in 1912. He participated in the formation of the New Zealand Labour Party in 1916. In 1918 he was elected to the New Zealand parliament. The next year he became leader of the parliamentary Labour Party. The Labour Party had mixed fortunes as it tried to forge a role in the political structure in New Zealand. At the 1931 general election, it won 24 of the 79 seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With increasing physical and emotional exhaustion and ill health, Harry Holland's support began to wane. His lack of political skills and his blunt honesty became greater burdens. In the parliamentary session of early 1933 he was less effective and his greater disillusionment was apparent. On 8 October 1933 Harry Holland attended the funeral of Te Rata Mahuta, a Maori king. He collapsed during the service and died later that day in Huntly. He was laid to rest in the cemetery above Wellington harbour. Had he survived, it is almost certain that he would have led the New Zealand Labour Party to victory when it formed its first government in 1935. M.J. Savage, his deputy, remarked to Holland's widow, `Harry's life of service enabled us to win.'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1974, section 23G of the Income Tax Assessment Act was enacted after the High Court had ruled that credit unions were not exempt from tax under the mutuality principle. The exemption of credit unions from taxation was supported by both the government and opposition of the day. Now the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) proposes to remove this exemption for credit unions at the beginning of the 1994-95 year. This proposal means that credit unions will be taxed at the rate of 20 per cent until 1997-98, when it will increase to the full corporate rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on record my opposition to this measure and the opposition of the Hastings Credit Union, which is based in my electorate. By removing this tax exemption, the Treasurer has ignored the unique role credit unions play in the financial sector of our local communities. The Hastings Credit Union is owned and funded completely by its members. Any income earned by the credit union, apart from that required to meet expenses, is returned to the members in the form of better rates of interest on savings and loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposed tax is a tax on volunteers. The Hastings Credit Union relies on volunteer directors, elected by the membership, to manage its affairs. This tax is a tax on self-help. The Hastings Credit Union members work together to achieve a better life for themselves and their community. The `not for profit activities' differentiate the Hastings Credit Union from its competitors. The Hastings Credit Union is involved in financial support to Credit Line in New South Wales; supports attendees at the regularly held youth forums; supports community service announcements on local radio; sponsors and supports several local sporting and charitable organisations, such as the surf lifesaving club; as well as generally promoting the development of the local Hastings and Manning communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of its current tax exemption, the Hastings Credit Union will need to consider access to other capital instruments to support its growth. Access to permanent share capital would fundamentally alter the participatory structure around which credit unions operate. Their growth rates and their accessibility to consumers will be adversely affected by the proposed policy change. It is simply not true of the government to suggest that the needs previously satisfied by the credit unions are now adequately met by others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most obviously, the cooperative one member, one vote structure of credit unions provides a unique alternative to the consumers in the Hastings. The Hastings Credit Union provides particular services and products which are not available elsewhere. For example, credit unions continue to offer low value term loans while banks have withdrawn from this market in favour of high interest credit card facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite their relatively small size, credit unions have been leaders in the introduction of new technology. For example, credit unions were the first to introduce automatic teller machines to Australia. As finance companies desert the consumer market and as building societies progressively strive for bank status, it is imperative for the credit union industry to remain viable and prosperous and for Australian consumers to continue to have access to an alternative form of financial institution. This need is even greater in a deregulated market. I have a letter here from Mr Neville Parsons, General Manager of the Hastings Credit Union, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A tax on credit unions is a tax on choice. Whereas the government is handing out tax breaks and income support worth hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign and domestic banks, this tax will punish the growth potential of the credit union industry by taxing its only source capital.</PARA>
<PARA>This afternoon I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) oppose this tax in his speech on the budget. I join with him in asking the government to drop this tax which will only cost more Australians their jobs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic liberalisation and development in China has not brought about the democracy&mdash;Wei Jingsheng's fifth freedom&mdash;that many Western observers hoped for. All the great modern portrayals of totalitarian states, from Orwell's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">1984</EMPHASIS> to Godard's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alphaville</EMPHASIS>, have been based on the ideas and intensive technology of the age of mass production. In the West we live in an age where new technology and business tools&mdash;personal computers, desktop publishing, fax machines and cellular phones&mdash;give us new ways to work and express ourselves. China, however, is using the old technology of mass production as a tool of oppression, and nowhere more so than in the Laogai, the system of labour camps where Wei was held. The human rights group, Asia Watch, has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Laogai is the world's largest system of forced labour and imprisonment. It is a vast network of prisons, camps and jails in which millions of prisoners are held and forced to work on behalf of the state. It is grossly abusive of human rights&mdash;torture is rife, and squalor, abuse and degradation the norm. It is, in short, the last gulag.</PARA>
<PARA>The Laogai is a natural outgrowth of a political system that seeks to bring all Chinese under the control of government autocracy. Across the length and breadth of China there are 3,000 or more Laogai facilities. Under Deng Xiaoping's guiding principle of `socialism with Chinese characteristics', labour camps have been urged to become self-financing. In 1988 alone, the Laogai produced over two billion yuans worth of goods and services, contributing perhaps as much as 10 per cent to the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Laogai, unlike its Nazi and Soviet counterparts, is so expansive that it pervades all aspects of national planning, and has such careful planning and organisation that the commodities produced in the camps form an integral part of the Chinese economy. Officially, this prison camp produce is for use by Chinese citizens alone, but increasing evidence shows that much of it is exported to earn hard foreign currency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Asia Watch suggests that prison factories may be exporting to more than 30 countries around the world, earning at least $US700 million annually. There is virtually no product that the camps do not manufacture. The most popular goods for export are coffee, tea, spices, salt, cement, plastics, rubber, textiles, ceramics, glass, iron, steel, copper, lead, nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery, electrical goods and vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A camp with the internal name of `No. 1 Laogai Camp of Beijing' is publicly known as `State Operated Qinghe Farm' or`Qinghe Machine Factory'. Prison labour has played an important part in China's surge into the international market economy. Prison labour is cheap. Volvo recently refused to develop a Chinese plant after being offered Laogai labour. A company spokesman described the offer as revolting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the material I have raised tonight comes from a book by Harry Wu, an academic and Laogai inmate for 19 years, who toured Australia in June.

I am sure we all support ensuring this does not take place, and that Australia can continue to press for what will truly be a more open China. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In mid-April 1993, the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC) changed its name to Telstra Corporation Limited. To reflect this change in name and to upgrade its overall corporate identity, a new logo was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) There has been a proliferation of brands and products introduced over the years which needed to be brought back under the Telecom umbrella. Whilst the Telecom "T" was one of the most recognised symbols in the country, market research showed that there had been some negative associations with the symbol (ie, a monopolistic and bureaucratic organisation).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The new logo is central part of the new corporate identity for Telstra Corporation and reflects its move into a competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) I am advised that Telstra paid $2 million for design, market research and legal protection for the new logo. The cost of replacing the livery on marketing materials, phone booths, service vans and phone bills will be absorbed over time within existing budgets by charging against deferred expenditure or within amortised budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The advantages to Telecom in changing its logo were:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The old logo was a stylized "T" symbolising various engineering elements of the Company and the orange symbolised the unique colour of the Australian outback.</PARA>
