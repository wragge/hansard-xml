<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will come as no surprise to the government, I am sure, that the coalition will not be opposing the Australian Land Transport Development Amendment Bill, just as I am sure it will come as no surprise to the government that the opposition will be using the opportunity that this bill affords us through the debate to press home some of the concerns that people who happen to use our road and transport systems have about the government's policies on road funding, which has been seriously reduced in the last budget and will be reduced further in the next budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also be expressing the concerns that those people who use our roads have about the government's decision to increase fuel excise by 5c a litre for unleaded fuel and 7c a litre for leaded fuel. Indeed, the announcement in the budget speech of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on 17 August was for an increase of 10c a litre. Those people who use our roads are very concerned about the high level of taxation this government is now imposing on them. Likewise, as the bill directly relates to the issue of road funding, people in the community are thoroughly sick and tired of discovering reductions in road funding by the government, and we will express those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bill is to extend the life of the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988. Those of us who were here in 1988 will recall that the government instituted a new mechanism whereby roads for which the Commonwealth had responsibility would be funded. That was due to expire at the end of the current financial year&mdash;by the middle of next year. The trust fund through which the moneys would be expended expires at the end of this calendar year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of a decision made at the heads of government meetings and also at the ATAC meetings&mdash;the Australian Transport Advisory Council, which is made up of Commonwealth, state and territory ministers for transport&mdash;there has been agreement to establish new legislation outlining the Commonwealth's responsibilities for roads and to provide a mechanism to fund those responsibilities. However, because of the way in which those agreements have been arrived at, there are delays in the drawing up of the new legislation which will carry the Commonwealth's road funding commitments. As a result, and in order to overcome the consequence of that, the government has decided to extend the life of the current Australian land transport development trust fund.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the opposition's strong support for the Commonwealth's role in road funding, we will be agreeing with the government on this bill to ensure that there is no obstacle in the way of the Commonwealth providing funds to maintain our roads in some semblance of order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, it is worth now moving to the point which I think concerns so many motorists and users of our road transport system in Australia today&mdash;that is, the deteriorating amount of funds that the Commonwealth is applying to roads for which it has responsibility. In the last financial year, about $1,630 million was expended by the Commonwealth to meet its road commitments. This year, in the budget brought down by the Treasurer on 17 August&mdash;the budget which was described by virtually all fair and reasonable observers as the worst budget brought down in living memory, by a Treasurer who has been severely mauled in the press, in the minds of the public and by his own party's caucus and his own ministerial colleagues&mdash;there is a road funding commitment of $1,020 million. So we have gone from $1,630 million in road funding allocations to $1,020 million. If we look at the budget papers provided on the night on which the budget was brought down, we will see that the forward estimate for the next financial year is that the Commonwealth will outlay $813 million towards its road funding commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One needs to have only a basic knowledge of arithmetic to work out that, if the government spent $1,630 million in the last financial year and in the next financial year it is proposing to spend $813 million, in effect the government has cut its road funding allocations in half in the course of two years. That, of course, would cause concern to any reasonable and fair observer, particularly people who use our roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note as I speak this morning that the former land transport minister, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), is in the chamber. I know that he shares, along with all those other people, concerns about the inadequate amounts of funding that the Commonwealth is allocating for roads. It was he who brought into this House a few years ago a very innovative and effective program to overcome some of our worst road accident sites: the black spots program. It was one of the most effective programs that any government has introduced to overcome accidents, injuries and deaths on our roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of money spent through the black spots program saved more lives per dollar spent than would ordinarily have been expected to be achieved out of ordinary road funding. Yet, as I am sure the honourable member for Charlton despairs, that program has now expired. Despite the original concept of its expiry in the last few months, I think the evidence has been more than sufficient to prove to anybody that we should have continued with the black spots road funding program and continued to provide funding to it so that we could overcome those road sites that we all know in our local areas are the cause of so many accidents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth making the point&mdash;and I think the black spots program proved it beyond any doubt, as will all the research done through the very authoritative sources that we have in Australia and overseas&mdash;that good roads are safe roads. If we do not have good roads and if we do not have the funding to achieve good roads, deaths and injuries will occur on our roads in a needless fashion. The motorists of Australia, the people who use our roads and who pay their taxes at the petrol bowser, are very concerned at the way in which this government has wiped out the black spots program, ending something that had proved its worth, and at the same time has halved road funding over a period of two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Motorists know that the change has occurred. They also know that today they are paying more taxes at the petrol bowser than they have ever paid in the history of this country. When Labor came to power 10 1/2 years ago fuel taxes at the petrol pump were 6c a litre. Under the Labor government's administration today, we now have a mechanism in place which will see petrol taxes go to 31c a litre for diesel and unleaded fuel and 33c a litre for leaded fuel. That is a direct result of this government's decision to use fuel as a means of raising revenue rather than raising revenue through the traditional means of the ordinary PAYE tax mechanism or other indirect tax measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the government will say about fuel taxes, `Well, we have to fund our commitments to education, to defence, to social security, to child care, to nursing homes and all the other things; therefore we can justify increasing taxes on fuel', no government and no fair or reasonable person could credibly argue that putting up taxes on fuel will assist our ability to create jobs. The government is reducing Australia's ability to create jobs. By lifting fuel taxes from 6c a litre to up to 33c a litre, the government is increasing the cost of doing business in Australia. It is reducing Australia's ability to compete and to export in the international marketplace and, by doing that, is reducing our ability to create jobs. The evidence is there for all to see: unemployment is hovering at around 10 1/2 per cent to 11 1/4 per cent, and seemingly we are not able to get out of that rut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for that is that governments are treating the people who use our roads as a vehicle through which to raise revenue for the purposes of operating their activities. That is not the right thing to do. It is hurting people very badly. The government's decision to reduce its road funding commitment is also hurting people unfairly. The opposition is determined to make these points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I look at my notes, I am reminded of the speech of the honourable member for Charlton when he first introduced the black spots road funding program. On that occasion he said that the black spots program would save 220 lives per annum. Road accidents cost this country in excess of $6 billion a year. Of course, any attempts to reduce the number of people killed or injured on our roads will have a very beneficial impact on the nation's income. As well, there is the fact that we would have less misery and suffering in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about road funding we need to recognise that every dollar we take away from road funding, whether away from the normal allocations to roads or away from special programs like the black spots program, will cause both social and economic harm to this country. We need to recognise that. The honourable member for Charlton highlighted that when he introduced the black spots road funding program. In his speech then he said that for every $4 million spent on the normal road funding allocation a life could be saved, but under the black spots program for every $500,000 spent a life could be saved. In other words, the black spots program gave eight times more value for money in saving lives than does normal road funding, yet this government cut out that program in the last budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in their hearts people like the honourable member for Charlton, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) and many others on the government side of the House who are interested in transport matters know that the decision to do away with the black spots campaign is a very bad one. Whilst supporting the government's bill before the House today, the opposition makes an appeal to the government to reintroduce the black spots road funding program because it should never have been cut out and it has tremendous advantage for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting aside the black spots program, we also make a plea to the government to allocate more funds to the road budget overall. We think the government can afford to do this because, over the next couple of years, it will reap billions and billions of dollars from the pockets of motorists in excess of what it used to get. By this time next year only 8.7c in every dollar collected in fuel excise will go towards roads. That means that in every dollar taken from the motorist at the petrol bowser there are 91.3c in the form of this government's taxes that do not go towards roads. That translates into about $8 billion or $9 billion per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say that we should go back to the days before this government came into power, pre-1983, when the then coalition government used to allocate towards roads 4c of the 6c collected in fuel excise. Two-thirds of all fuel excises collected by the previous coalition government was allocated towards improving our roads. Obviously a jump of that magnitude would be inconceivable in one budget, or even in two or three budgets. But let me make a plea to the government from this side of the House: the government ought to start working towards achieving a goal of returning to roads more of the moneys that are collected through fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do better roads saves lives and injuries; they also reduce the cost of transport. In the process of constructing and maintaining those roads we create many much needed jobs. I know that on previous occasions the honourable member for Charlton has spoken very highly of the job creation opportunities arising from road funding. Of course, the more the government increases road funding the more the opportunities are increased to create jobs, the more the likelihood is increased that people will have their lives saved or injuries reduced, and the more the likelihood is increased that the cost of transport in Australia will go down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many good reasons to sustain the argument of members of the opposition. We are correct in pushing the issue of increased road funding, in pushing the issue of reintroducing the black spots program and in pushing the issue of trying to reduce the cost of transport by not treating fuel as a milch cow, in some sort of cargo cult mentality, to ensure that we can reduce the cost of transport in Australia so that it does not affect our ability to compete in the international marketplace and therefore reduce our ability to create jobs. From this side of the House we make that plea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that my views and the views of members of the opposition are well and truly supported by ordinary road users, particularly by the commercial end of the road use business&mdash;that is, the transport industry. I spoke at the Australian Livestock Transport Association annual conference in Sydney on Friday afternoon following the address of the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins. I can only say that Senator Collins's reception on that occasion was, to put it mildly, frosty because members of the Australian Livestock Transport Association well recognise the huge cost impost that has been imposed on them by this government with the 5c a litre increase in the cost of fuel brought down in the budget of 17 August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give an example of that, prior to the meeting, the livestock transport people who were present at the conference on Friday highlighted to me the cost of transporting, say, live cattle out of the port of Darwin. In fact, Jim Cooper from Gulf Transport gave me this example. He said that the cost of transporting live cattle, which is a rapidly growing industry for the Northern Territory and for Australia, out of Darwin will go up by $1.80 a head because of the 5c a litre increase in the cost of diesel. He cited the example of a six-decker road train, of which he has many, sourcing cattle from Queensland and trucking those cattle through Queensland, up into the territory and out through the port of Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net consequence of jacking up the fuel tax by 5c a litre for one small aspect of the transport industry is to increase the cost of exporting our live cattle by up to $1.80 a head. That means that Australia is less competitive when competing for live cattle sales in the international marketplace. That is something that should concern every Australian, because from the income that we earn from those live cattle sales we can create jobs, and we so desperately need those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From those sorts of examples given at the conference of the Australian Livestock Transport Association last Friday, it is clear that these people are well justified in criticising this government for its budget measures of reducing road funding and increasing the taxes that road users have to pay for the privilege of driving on our roads. We make these points, secure in the knowledge that we are supported by the great bulk of Australian society and, indeed, by everyone involved in the Australian road transport industry because they have to wear the costs of these increased taxes and live with the consequences of there being less funds to spend on our roads to improve and maintain them. If we add to all of that the increased sales tax of two per cent that will be imposed on road users, which adds about another $2,400 to the cost of buying, say, a truck, these people are justified in expressing their concerns, as is the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether they be truck operators who are going to have to pay on average around $6,000 a year extra for their fuel bills, $2,400 a year extra for the purchase of a truck because of sales tax increases, and about $400 a year extra in operating expenses because of sales tax increases, or people who drive ordinary cars on the road to visit or do business, they are justified in their criticisms of this government. We who represent all those people in this House should be concerned on their behalf. That is why the government should heed the comments and the pleas of the opposition today to increase road funding, reintroduce the black spots program, stop treating the road users of Australia as a milch cow and do something to save lives, to save injuries, to reduce the cost of transport in Australia and to make Australia a more competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that, the opposition will support this bill, recognising that to do otherwise would simply provide an obstacle to the normal flow of Commonwealth funds to the states for the purpose of maintaining our road infrastructure. We support the bill, express those concerns and ask the government to act upon the pleas from this side of the House and from members of the road transport industry, because those pleas are well based and are meant sincerely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the previous speaker, the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), indicated, the purpose of the Australian Land Transport Development Amendment Bill is to provide interim arrangements before more detailed and specific legislation is introduced later on. Before the shadow minister goes, I would like to say that I appreciate the genuine level of balance that he brings to his responsibilities. While we differ in some considerations, I agree with a lot of what he said and I appreciate the generous comments that he made about the development of road transport policy and programs&mdash;some, to which he was kind enough to refer, having been developed while I was the minister. I have always appreciated my association with him and, as I say, the genuine way in which he has approached his responsibilities on behalf of the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make just one point of criticism in connection with the points that the shadow minister made. One of my good friends, and a very close colleague of mine, recently expressed it in these terms: how is it that the tories all support reducing the deficit but always want to see more money spent on roads and the cost of petrol reduced in the process of government cutting taxes? There is a very serious anomaly there that is difficult to reconcile. Along with the shadow minister, I would like to see a very substantial increase in the level of funding for those areas for which I maintain a very special interest. Of course, I have been in a position of being able to assess the significance of those changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has come through a period of very significant reform across the whole area of land transport. Over the last few years&mdash;and some of these were mentioned by the shadow minister&mdash;quite significant changes have been introduced. Many of those changes were made in the context of an Industry Commission report which indicated that, if Australia was able to achieve world standard efficiency in land transport, there would be a saving in the national cost of operating land transport to the extent of about $6,000 million&mdash;$4,000 million in the area of rail transport and $2,000 million in the area of road transport. It would have represented an overall benefit to our gross domestic product of something like three per cent, and that would represent an increase in GDP of something in excess of $10,000 million. Very substantial benefits would have accrued to the national economy, the national community, Australian families, income earners and producers as a result of those types of improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some additional considerations directed our attention to the types of reforms that were necessary. It was indicated&mdash;the shadow minister referred to this as well&mdash;that the national cost of road trauma is in excess of $6,000 million every year. We also had a continuing annual loss on the national rail system of $4,000 million every year. It was indicated that about $2.1 billion of that involved the types of losses which could be identified from the accounts for our rail systems. The remainder, the difference between the $2.1 billion and the $4 billion, lay in in-built costs which were not necessarily apparent from the accounts, such as hidden subsidies, concessions, reserve freight arrangements and so on. There was also about $400 million that was being lost on interstate freight movement for the Australian rail system. In the context of that and other considerations, the government embarked on a series of initiatives which, taken together, would represent the most significant group of initiatives in land transport ever considered. First of all, there was a record level of road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are about 30 new members in this chamber since the last election and many of them have heard conflicting arguments about what happened in connection with road funding. I want to emphasise to them that, say, for the first seven years after the Labor government was elected in 1983, there was an increase of 20 per cent in real terms in the total level of funds being applied to the road system compared with the seven years of the Fraser government. That represented an average increase of something like $250 million every year for each of those seven years&mdash;a very major increase in the level of funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone knows of claims to the contrary that have been made by opposition spokesmen and women. Their claims cannot be substantiated, and the figures indicate that very clearly. In 1992-93, the financial year that we have just come through, the total level of funding for roads was $2.1 billion. That represented an increase in real terms of 25 per cent on the 1991-92 level of funding. These increases have been very substantial. People cannot drive around Australia either in their private motor cars or in their rigs and not realise that over the last 13 or 15 years there has been a very substantial increase in the quality of that network, as there needs to be, of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national highway system will stand as a permanent monument to Labor initiatives. It was introduced in the first place by a Labor government and it was extended by another 2,500 kilometres when I was minister, making a total of 18,500 kilometres of national highway around Australia for which this federal government has accepted full responsibility. People should take the opportunity to read the brochure recently prepared by the Department of Transport and Communications entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The length of the land: Australia's national highway</EMPHASIS>, which indicates the importance and significance of the national highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also established the National Road Transport Commission. The purpose of that was to achieve for the first time a level of uniformity for both technical and operational standards in road transport. Prior to that, there were about 200 separate regulations between the various states and state authorities. They were often conflicting, ambiguous and stupid regulations which needed to be torn out and made consistent, non-ambiguous and non-confusing. The National Road Transport Commission that we set up&mdash;an independent body reporting to the Australian council of transport ministers&mdash;was the means by which we attempted to overcome that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also introduced uniform charging for heavy vehicles on the roads. The Inter-State Commission originally made recommendations that mass distance charges should be about $22,000 for a six-axle articulated vehicle, $42,000 for a B-double and $70,000 for a triple-decker road train. In the system that we finally adopted, we incorporated a pay at the bowser element which had been requested by the road transport industry. That meant that the introduction of uniform charging was going to be much more sensible and the transport industry would be able to adapt itself to it much more easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, we also extended the national highway system. We had adopted, initially in the 1970s, 16,000 kilometres of national highway around Australia essentially linking together the capital cities. But it was apparent to me and to others that, in linking together the capital cities, there was no direct link between Brisbane and Melbourne and between Adelaide and Sydney. The Melbourne-Brisbane link was based essentially on the Newell Highway and the Adelaide-Sydney link was based essentially on the Sturt Highway. This added to the original 16,000 kilometres of national highway a distance of 2,500 kilometres. To put that into context, I suppose it would go from Canberra to London or perhaps even into Scotland. There are 18,500 kilometres of national highway and this federal government has accepted the responsibility for every cent which is spent on either developing or maintaining that system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had significant improvements as far as programs in urban public transport were concerned. Prior to that, states could voluntarily take about 25 per cent of their state arterial funds and apply that to urban public transport projects. I thought that funds should be required to be put into urban public transport because every improvement there means that pressure is taken off the road system. It means the road system does the job better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electorate of the honourable member for Prospect, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Mrs Crosio), who is at the table at the present time, benefited substantially from that because of her vigilance in making sure that she identified where those improvements could be brought about. She brought them to my attention, we supplied the funds and her constituents have now benefited substantially from that program, as they did from the black spots program. All of those honourable members who were vigilant in taking advantage of those programs made sure that they brought some of the benefits that accrued from those programs into their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We increased the volume of funds going to urban public transport from what would have been about $115 million over those three years to $200 million. We said to the states, `Use it for public transport projects. Indicate to us what they are and we will work out with you the types of projects that should be implemented'. And we introduced some very remarkable and important ones. As part of the federal government's social equity approach, we particularly wanted to make sure that a lot of that funding went into the outer suburbs of the major metropolitan and provincial cities. That is where it went&mdash;into the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that your electorate benefited substantially because you, like so many of our members and colleagues, were vigilant about the way in which advantage could be taken of those good programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we first introduced the black spots program, it was going to represent about $110 million over a three-year period. It was so popular because it was so successful and because it eliminated in excess of 4,000 of the worst death spots over the whole of Australia. Because it was saving lives and stopping crashes and injuries, that $110 million program finished up being a $270 million program. We cannot identify the people in the community whose lives have been saved as a result of that program, but we know they are there in their hundreds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also established the National Road Trauma Advisory Council. It was originally chaired by Sir Nicholas Shehadie and was suggested to us by Sir Dennis Paterson from South Australia. We brought together people with expertise in various areas to advise us about road trauma. The new chairman, Collin Freeland, a former senior bureaucrat within the federal bureaucracy, is helping to continue the solid leadership that was provided by Nick Shehadie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we put that black spots program together with the National Road Trauma Advisory Council; the Federal Office of Road Safety&mdash;which had the responsibility, on behalf of the federal government, of managing our approach to road safety&mdash;cooperative state authorities and voluntary community organisations concerned with road safety; all of the road improvements that came about, whether they were improvements in the road pavement and network itself or in the elimination of black spots; and education programs, we can see that there has been a remarkable reduction in the number of people killed on the roads. However, we should never be tolerant of a situation where those figures are substantial, as they continue to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1970 the number of people who died on the road network peaked at about 3,800. That figure was brought down as a result of all of those elements to which I referred, until, in 1988, 2,800 people died. Last year&mdash;1992&mdash;was the first year since records have been kept that the number of people killed on the road network dropped below 2,000. It has almost halved in those 20 years. Serious injuries were reduced from about 50,000 to 30,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those elements amount to substantial benefits in the area of road transport and the road network. We encourage the establishment of a peak national transport body. The National Transport Forum consists of representatives of all of the peak national transport bodies and acts as an umbrella organisation to give one voice to transport interests. Bruce McIver is now the chairman of that forum. He was the founder of the Livestock Transport Association, and is a former state and national president of that association and chairman of the National Transport Forum. This is a development of enormous significance which brings people together to give them one voice so that we can speak to them in the development of policy. They introduced a self-accreditation scheme, with federal government funding, cooperation and encouragement, to make it possible for higher standards of professionalism to be encouraged in an industry where professionalism had already reached a very high level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We introduced vehicle safety regulations. The national control of vehicle standards is now under the jurisdiction of the federal government because of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act which I had the privilege of introducing into the parliament. We now control the quality of vehicles that come onto our road network. Whether they are buses, motorbikes, motor cars or trucks, we control that at the national level and we have consistent standards right across Australia. We have taken it away from the absurd situation that existed before, when we had some ridiculous contrasts in what one state expected in comparison with the state across that imaginary line we call a state border. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been substantial improvements in areas of bus safety as well. The rollover provisions, non-lock brakes, seat mountings and padding and seat belts have all been introduced in the last few years as a result of initiatives by a federal Labor government. We introduced a bicycle strategy to encourage people to use bicycles&mdash;a very conservative, conservationist type system of travel&mdash;to encourage people not to take their motor cars out, to encourage healthy lifestyles and to encourage improvements in the environment and a reduction in atmospheric pollution from motor cars. We cooperated with national bicycle groups in developing that strategy. They applauded it. They said that it was the first time&mdash;as it was&mdash;that an approach had been made at a national level to achieve any type of strategy. We got that strategy adopted by all of the states. They undertook that, in future when they were planning and developing their own road networks and transport systems, they would take into account the need to provide for bike riders and bicycles as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those elements that I referred to have been responsible for putting Australia right at the front of development around the world not only in the quality of road construction and the nature of design but also in the way in which the whole of the transport industry has been brought together, coordinated and integrated, to make sure that we achieve the sorts of benefits that those reports, such as the Industry Commission report, indicated would be available. So we have been able to coordinate a total land transport strategy. That is in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns that I had was a proposal, which the federal government agreed to, as a result of an approach made by the states in the context of the Special Premiers Conference process, to develop what was being referred to as new federalism. The states said to us, `Move out of our areas'. One of those areas is state arterial roads. They said to us, `You give us the money; do not tie it. We will look after our roads. You move out and just look after the national highway system'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not support that approach. I did not support, and I do not support, the decision that this government made in acceding to it. I said then, and I have had it confirmed, that we could not trust the states. I asserted then, and have had it confirmed since, that they would not use that money for roads. They are in the process of tucking away the $300 million that we untied and handed back to them. They are putting it into all different sorts of programs but away from roads. New South Wales has announced and disclosed recently that, out of the total of the untied money that went to New South Wales, $50 million was taken straight out of the roads budget. We know, and everyone else knows, what will now happen. Pressure will come back on the national government. Because of the national importance of a road network, it will be necessary to provide funds to overcome the dereliction of responsibility of the states. When the roads start to fall apart, those people who are concerned about them&mdash;transport operators and ordinary motorists&mdash;will want to know why. One of the chief reasons is that we have given the states the money to fix up, maintain, extend and improve the roads, but they are using those funds for purposes other than those for which we provided them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As other members have indicated, the Australian Land Transport Development Amendment Bill primarily extends the time available for the operation of the funding provisions that the government now has through the Australian land transport development trust fund. The bill is necessary to ensure that the funds that the Commonwealth has allocated in the budget are available for road expenditure. Nevertheless, that is done in the context of substantial reductions in road funding. I take the point of the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) that about $350 million of funds previously identified for roads has now been put into the states' general purpose funding arrangements. They are expected to continue to spend this on roads which are their particular responsibility outside of the national highway system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disturbed by the remarks of the honourable member for Charlton that certain state governments are not taking that responsibility seriously. I think they should be subject to criticism at home and abroad. I do not oppose the concept of states being responsible for funding for their roads. If a particular level of government has a responsibility which is identified clearly, it should meet that responsibility and suffer the consequences electorally if it fails to do so. I would join with any other federal member in criticising a state government that backed away from that responsibility and attempted to use that money for another purpose. I trust that that matter will be attended to in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, it does not alter the fact that, after a big splash of spending on roads, the budget figures indicate quite clearly a cutback in the amount of money that will be made available to the fund this year for the purpose of road construction. We have $350 million put away through general purpose funding. Looking at the figures, I see that, whereas about $1.6 billion in total was allocated last year, that is to come down to an average of $800 million a year. According to the explanatory memorandum provided, funding will be $2.46 billion over three years. I do not know why we keep being told how much will be spent over three years. We have annual budgets. I believe that the amounts should be identified year by year. It gets even worse on an annual basis when, from the figures I am able to establish, about a billion dollars is to be allocated this year plus the $350 million that has been transferred away. If I add up the $1 billion-plus and the $350 million, I find that the total is only about $1.4 billion, which is a couple of hundred million dollars down on last year. So that in itself must be the subject of criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been said here this morning about the need for an adequate road system. I join with others in saying that special allocations should be targeted to black spots&mdash;in other words, areas of the roads where there is adequate evidence of frequent crashes or deaths. In raising the black spot program today in a slightly broader context, I highlight something that was raised here just yesterday by the opposition on the use of federal government funding to the states as a process of blackmail. The minister responsible for roads made the granting of black spot funding in Western Australia conditional on Western Australia altering its laws as to the level of blood alcohol. For driving purposes in Western Australia the blood alcohol level is 0.08&mdash;a figure that seemed to be achieving very similar results to that of other states which had a 0.05 blood alcohol level. There is no statistical evidence to suggest that more people were being killed in Western Australia. After some public opposition, particularly from me, when random breath testing was introduced there was a massive growth in deaths. When I raised that matter in the press and asked, `Where are the promises that the police gave us about random breath testing saving lives?', people came back and said, `We never promised to save lives; we just said that we would get the drunks off the roads'. I said, `If you have the drunks off the roads, what has been killing people all these years?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All sorts of statistics can be produced showing the number of people with high blood alcohol levels who are involved in crashes. I do not disagree that they are a contributing factor, but I think the statistics tend to overstate the situation. The reason for the accident might have been totally unrelated to blood alcohol. If anybody is found dead or injured in a vehicle, police take a blood sample. That particular crash is then designated an alcohol related crash. I think that is very silly. We should be looking at some of the other problems such as road standards and black spots, which are a major contributing factor. As a representative of rural areas, I use these roads all the time and I know that to be the case. Whilst there was some doubt as to whether a 0.08 blood alcohol level was more significant than 0.05, there was no doubt statistically as to these dangerous spots on the roads. The government said, `You don't get the black spot money unless you line up on the 0.05 issue'. In other words, it said, `We will continue to allow people to get killed on these very identifiable and dangerous parts of the road while we argue with you over another issue of less consequence'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day in this place the government gave us another example. Notwithstanding the fact that a state government had power in this area, the federal government said to the people, `If we are elected, we will cease the practice of making guild fees in tertiary institutions compulsory'. That seemed to be pretty fair and above board. The government was elected, but then it introduced legislation to take money away from education and give it to political activists. It said, `We, the federal government, do not agree with you, the state government, on a matter of policy duly debated during an election campaign'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I cannot understand the benefit to students of taking away money from their education and giving it to another area&mdash;which it had the right to do. It is just another example of the sort of blackmail that the black spot issue identified. The irony of the black spot issue is that, having bullied the Western Australia government into passing legislation on the 0.05 limit, it has now cancelled the black spots program. It is a great lesson for state governments which comply on such issues; they gain nothing in the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday we raised the issue of landcare funding. One of the fundamentals of any environmental program is being made conditional on the state knuckling its forehead to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his proposals to solve the problem of Aboriginal native title. I could not believe those two issues could be linked in that fashion&mdash;but we had it confirmed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). Western Australia&mdash;the state that I represent&mdash;is a huge area with massive resources contributing 25 per cent of national exports. It has to be linked by roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had no say as a nation&mdash;and the Prime Minister was not able to control it&mdash;on where the iron ore or gold came up through the surface. Whoever made those decisions made sure those deposits were about as far from our population centres as they possibly could be and as far as possible from the coast where they might be processed or from where they might be exported. Western Australia has had to provide the infrastructure of roads, in particular, to service those very remote developments. We can take the product away by rail, but the very small number of people associated with developments of that nature in this modern day require the services of roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Past conservative governments recognised that to the extent that just 25 years ago, when all these great developments were occurring, Western Australia was paid some 18 per cent of total national road funding, as provided by the Commonwealth. We have seen that sink to eight per cent. Whilst I could not argue in the modern context for 18 per cent, I genuinely believe that eight per cent is far too little. But it is eight per cent in real terms of such a substantially reduced amount of money. This is where the real problem arises. The states&mdash;and the system&mdash;are no longer receiving anywhere near the same proportion of moneys in terms of road funding, as was once provided.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point the graph makes is that there has been a massive increase in taxes collected and, relatively, an ever declining proportion spent on roads. As with many other taxes, it was introduced for no other purpose than road construction and maintenance&mdash;the old user pays concept. Whilst I do not object to the user paying, traditionally&mdash;as with all such taxes&mdash;once people grab hold of them, the taxes get worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian government has put forward a proposal to be given the approximately 6c per litre that the federal government now raises from road taxes. The Western Australian government wants to administer the lot. The honourable member for Charlton says that that might not be wise. Basically, it would give Western Australia substantially more money than it is getting at the moment for road maintenance and development. This huge state, delivering 25 per cent of national exports, should have the support of the nation in providing infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We provide about 40 per cent of grain production&mdash;another part of the export system that requires a substantial road infrastructure. It is just not practical to go on cutting back. In fact, Western Australians consume, per capita, 1.5 times the amount of automotive fuel consumed by the people of New South Wales. They also consume a higher proportion of fuel which is subject to the diesel excise rebate. But when we allow for that, we find that Western Australians are paying about $50 per capita&mdash;a couple of hundred dollars per family&mdash;more in fuel tax than people who reside in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not very difficult to establish why, when we look at the size of the state, the remoteness of so many of our resources and the simple fact that that makes the provision of public transport, such as electric trains, so much more difficult. I frequently remind people in my electorate that, notwithstanding the approval certain people give to public transport, there is no chance of my walking out the door of the Wyalkatchem hall and catching the next electric train back to Perth. The train is not there; nor is a regular taxi or bus service. People have to drive their cars. This is a real problem in Western Australia; the road infrastructure has to be maintained and it is not being maintained when there is an ever declining allocation of aggregate moneys and an ever declining proportion of it going to Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years the states of Victoria and New South Wales have argued that they built our roads. Statistically, technically at least, they could sustain that argument. The reverse is now the truth. Under the present distribution arrangements, if Western Australia could be given the 6c per litre contributed through fuel taxes paid, it would have more money to spend on roads. It is a matter of great importance to us. I commend the state minister, Mr Charlton, for his efforts in trying to make this understood. He had the Commissioner for Main Roads put some figures together. It was stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If 6c per litre . . . of the Federal. . . excise collections from Western Australia were returned to the State, this would raise $132M pa, an increase of $33.6M pa over the 1993/94 indicative allocation of $98.4M . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The point he is making is pretty simple. Under the current arrangements, even on the basis of this roughly 6c per litre which we are confirming today, if the money continues to go to the Australian land transport fund, Western Australia is subsidising roads in more developed and smaller states to the tune of about $33 million a year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assuming that this additional revenue is pro-rated across National Roads and State Roads in accordance with the needs identified in Table 2 of the Roads 2000 Report (p 15), the following increase in revenue would result:</PARA>
<PARA>National roads would have an increase of $7.2 million, state roads an increase of $26.4 million for a total, as I have already mentioned, of $33.6 million. They are the official figures. I believe a state should receive no less than that, particularly when it is in Western Australia's situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Charlton also made a lot of the fact that the government has achieved certain arrangements in relation to uniformity of standards applicable to vehicles. I am a supporter of the concept that people should be able to drive from one side of Australia to the other and not have to stop at borders to unload a couple of tonnes, have the height  of their load checked, or have to get a special permit for a load. I have seen people delayed for a week at a border waiting for the right permit to take such things as agricultural machinery across the border. Whether we like it not, that machinery cannot be compressed to take it from one state to another. It is made in foreign countries to certain height and width specifications. It is downright silly that certain governments should try to prevent traffic carrying these loads on their roads when that is the only way for the loads to be transported. Even if these loads are transported by rail, there will always be a road component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My great fear, stemming from some of these arrangements, is that the debate is still concentrating on the lowest common denominator. Western Australia&mdash;along with Queensland from time to time&mdash;has led Australia in exciting new road transport configurations. Shortly after I went to the north-west in 1958, the situation was that, north of Carnarvon, people could drive a single prime mover and tow three trailers behind it, while north of Geraldton, a person could drive a single prime mover and tow two trailers behind it. I became active in the road transport industry and convinced the then Liberal government that that distinction was silly and that we ought to be able to drive multiple trailers out from the perimeter of Perth. We conducted a trial, which ran for six months, and it was so successful that within a month the government opened that section up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the debate still rages. We were then allowed to transport these trailers as far as 30 miles out of Perth, but it cost a third of the gross turnover of a single trailer to get someone else to come out, pick up that second trailer, and cart it in the last 30 miles. Little by little we have crept closer and closer&mdash;the distance is now eight miles out&mdash;but the cost has not changed. We still have to get someone else to pick up that particular trailer or else do a double trip. The honourable member for Charlton has said that these double road trains carrying stock, or other things, ought to be able to go straight into the suburbs of Perth, but people are going crazy over that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One person was foolish enough to say that it would double the amount of transport going past the front door when, in fact, it would halve it. At the present time, the trailers passing that person's place are passing one at a time. When two go together there is only one lot of noise. There is a lot of evidence to prove that this reduces road damage because there is not the extra weight of a second prime mover on the road. In fact, all the efficiencies go up. People have to stop using road safety measures as a means of protecting inefficient rail systems. Governments either have to make the rail systems efficient or they have to let the road transport system deliver the services. It is a service to the people and we have to put an end to the non-tariff barriers within our own country, such as we have today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the discussion on roads in Australia, and road funding in particular, in this debate on the Australian Land Transport Development Amendment Bill. I do so with a great degree of disappointment and sadness at the fact that, despite the national pressure that is continually applied to governments, both state and federal, to increase allocations for roads and to do something about upgrading our national road system, we have just seen a budget which slashes road funding to about the lowest level in real terms that our country has known. That kind of behaviour is inconsistent with a government that is dedicated to the development of our nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we really believe in regionalisation and in providing opportunities to all Australians, it is essential that we have a top class infrastructure system. A vital element of that infrastructure is clearly roads. So it is not good enough for the government to come into this place and suggest to the Australian people that the task is somehow completed and therefore less money should be allocated to roads. I know it is fashionable to talk about very fast trains and tilt trains, the Alice Springs to Darwin railway, and all sorts of other rail enhancement projects. No doubt many of these schemes have merit and a real place in Australia's transport system of the future. But, in reality, the number of rail lines in Australia is decreasing, and the share of our transport task undertaken on the roads is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just recently we witnessed the Queensland Premier, who received an increase in funding from the federal government, returning home from the Premiers Conference in Canberra and saying that 29 rail lines would be closed because he was out of money. He made that decision instantly upon returning from Canberra, so clearly the closures had been thought out well and truly in advance: 29 rural lines, about a third of the Queensland system, were to go. That is the kind of commitment that Labor in Queensland has towards our infrastructure system. Naturally there was an outcry when so much of the rail system was to go. A committee of inquiry was established and it is taking evidence all over the place. Every community is anxious to protect its rail line. The interesting thing that has come out of that inquiry is why people are not using the rail system. It is not because they do not like it or because they do not want it, but because the rail system has failed to provide a service. The inefficiencies, the lack of a professional marketing outlook, and the seeming lack of attention to customer needs, have led people to desert the rail systems of Australia in droves. It is not good enough and it needs to be fixed. There needs to be a much more professional approach to management of our rail systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But whatever happens to improve railway lines and the rail system across our country, there is still going to be an increasing demand for road transport services. There will be an increasing need for Australians to travel by road, using their motor vehicles, to get to their destinations, and for road transport to take an important role in our national freight task. We need better roads. It is a national disgrace that they have been allowed to decline as they have over recent times. Instead of our road system improving, it is degenerating. It is a disaster for our country that there are to be further reductions in road funding by this federal government. Those opposite should hold their heads in shame. I certainly feel sorry for the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who spoke earlier. He must feel deeply embarrassed that much of the work he did to build up the importance of roads on the national agenda has been so quickly whittled away since his departure from the ministry. The black spots program was axed absolutely, despite all the rhetoric that we have heard from government members over the years about the lives that would be saved and how critically important it was to our nation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A black day for black spots, and a black day for Australian motorists. Sadly, the ALP continues to give a low priority to roads. In his opening remarks the honourable member for Charlton criticised this side of the House because we advocate lower fuel tax but higher expenditure on roads. He said that that was inconsistent. It is not the slightest bit inconsistent because only a very small percentage of what is collected in fuel tax is actually spent on roads. There is infinite scope, just from the amount collected in fuel tax, to boost enormously the amount of funding available for roads. The days when all of the fuel excise was spent on roads are well and truly behind us, and that is disappointing. Today, perhaps less than a quarter of the fuel excise collected actually ends up being spent on roads. The money is diverted from the motorists of Australia to other projects. No doubt some of the projects are worthwhile government activities, but some of them, including projects to improve the swimming pool for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), or to provide a new carport, or barbecues for public servants, are not considered by motorists to be a wise use of their petrol dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that Labor has been using the fuel pumps of Australia as branch offices of the Australian Taxation Office. Fuel excise has become an integral part, a critical part, an increasing part&mdash;there has been something like a 700 per cent increase in fuel excise over the life of this government&mdash;of general revenue now rather than something specifically allocated to roads. Fuel tax is a particularly iniquitous tax in a vast country such as Australia. It is a tax on distance. The further people travel the more fuel tax they pay. If ever there were a country that ought not to tax distance it is a vast continent such as Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about decentralisation. The government sets up task forces and committees of inquiry to promote regionalisation and the like. Its new task force under the leadership of that great bastion of industry, Bill Kelty, is now travelling around Australia to look at ways of improving the lot of industry in country and provincial areas. That task force was set up in the same month as the government decided to increase fuel tax. So that shows how sincere the government is about really helping the rural and provincial areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fuel tax is a tax on everyone who does business outside of the capital cities. It adds to the price of every item on every shelf in every store for people who live outside of the capital cities. So, if the government is serious about doing something for provincial industry, serious about redressing the income imbalance between country and city, the first thing it should do is abolish fuel excise&mdash;get rid of it altogether&mdash;to give country industries an opportunity to compete fair and square with those located in city regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders about the sincerity of this particular task force that is now travelling around the countryside. Nearly all of the members of the task force have capital city addresses and yet they are supposed to be giving advice on what to do to assist provincial industry. There is only one Queenslander on the committee and he is a trade union activist. So the most decentralised state in Australia, the one with the most amount of provincial industry, has been worthy of only one place on this particular committee. The interstate members of the committee did not even think it was necessary to come to Queensland to attend any of the public hearings of the committee in that state. So this government is really demonstrating its lack of real interest in provincial regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That lack of real interest in provincial regions was heavily reinforced as the fuel tax was increased in this last budget&mdash;another 5c a litre, which was not announced, I might add during the lead-up to the election. At that time the government was critical of our proposals to abolish fuel excise altogether. But, when it got back into government, at the first available opportunity it put another heavy slug on Australian motorists through fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of that excise increase was the new tax that is to be imposed, a super tax on leaded petrol. The government claims that this has been introduced because of its desire to do something about lead levels in the atmosphere. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But, in reality, as the honourable member says, the government just wants more money. The government says it has imposed a super tax on leaded petrol to encourage conversion to unleaded fuel, but the Australian Institute of Petroleum reports that sales of leaded petrol are already falling by 5.7 million litres per month while unleaded sales increase by more than that amount. So the conversion is occurring without this new tax. The government says it wants the lead in air figure reduced below 1.5 micrograms per cubic metre&mdash;that is the National Health and Medical Research Council's level of concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the seasonally adjusted average across all testing sites in Brisbane has not exceeded 0.5 micrograms per cubic meter&mdash;a third of the safety level&mdash;since 1988.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sydney is supposed to be the main trouble spot, but even there the level of concern has not been exceeded since 1988, and the Environment Protection Authority now reports the lowest airborne lead levels on record. It seems to me that the problem has solved itself without the government's tax increase.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Road Ahead</EMPHASIS> of October 1993 deals with this question of lead in the blood of children.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know on which page the environment minister actually signed this particular document, but she clearly identified herself with that commitment, and now she has turned around and done precisely the opposite. These tax increases hurt country people particularly harshly. But they hurt also those who are actually trying to construct roads, because these new taxes will have to be paid by Australia's road builders. Not only has this government reduced its own allocations to road funding to appallingly low levels but also it is taxing to an increasing degree all of those authorities involved in road construction. It will particularly hurt local authorities who build a lot of country roads and, indeed, city roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read some comments about the effect on country local authorities in Queensland of this increase in fuel excise. The Barcoo shire in the west, which has only 189 ratepayers, will have to pay $14,013 extra in fuel excise as a result of this government increase. That will mean an extra bill of $74 for every ratepayer in the shire. The alternative is that the Barcoo shire build about half a kilometre less of bitumen road each year. Boulia shire, with 176 ratepayers, will have a rate rise of $73.86 for every ratepayer as a result of just this fuel excise increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the Brisbane City Council where the Lord Mayor, Alderman Sorley, was so critical of the coalition during the days leading up to the previous election? He was so concerned about potential cost increases on local government. But his city council will be up for another $982,061 just as a result of the government's fuel excise increases in this budget. I have not heard Alderman Sorley and his Labor mates complaining about that million dollar increase. That apparently is acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it again means that scores of additional streets in Brisbane will not be constructed and roads will not be repaired because this federal government has decided to take the money from Australian councils, from Australian road builders and put it in its own pocket. That really is a disgraceful way in which to deal with an important national infrastructure such as our road system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the tax on fuel&mdash;over 30c a litre&mdash;is now close to half the cost per litre of fuel in a state like Queensland. But that fuel excise is not the only tax the government collects from fuel. Like everyone else, fuel companies pay income tax and, like all other people involved in business, they will pay the increased sales taxes. The people selling and distributing fuel will pay the fuel excise on their own delivery costs, as well as all the other taxes that the government imposes on their day-to-day operations. So the government certainly has a very strong vested interest in people travelling as far as they can because it collects extra dollars on every mile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, fuel tax is a particularly iniquitous tax because of the way it penalises country industry and those who want to be productive in our community. The fuel tax falls particularly heavily on exporters who need to move their product to ports to go to other parts of the world. It is a tax, of course, that is not borne by most of our competitors around the world. It is an additional burden that Australian industry is required to wear as a result of this government's absolute determination to increase its revenue from Australian motorists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concerning aspect of road construction in Australia is the wasteful use of funds. I heard the honourable member for Charlton talk about the way in which the states siphon off road funding. Undoubtedly, a considerable proportion of the money provided by the federal government to the states for roads is not used on bitumen, gravel and concrete but to fund bureaucracies. The money is used to pay for the states' public servants&mdash;the ever increasing army of engineers, quality control officers, planning report providers, safety officers and the like, which these days produce enormous overheads on every road project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a council gets a release for a road construction project, it can expect something like one-quarter to one-third of the money to never actually be delivered because it has been used by the state government bureaucracy in measuring every pothole before it is filled and calculating economic assessments&mdash;all of which does nothing to extend our national road system. I might add&mdash;and this is of critical importance&mdash;there is no evidence that it has produced better quality roads. Indeed, there are many embarrassing examples of our state road construction authorities having to go back to repair a big new road project weeks after it has been opened. So, in fact, we have built a bureaucracy around our road system. So much of the money that is collected these days, which is allegedly allocated to road expenditure, does not go on producing better roads. It is time that kind of expenditure is brought to account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, there seems to be a lack of priority on important projects. So often we widen roads around poor alignments rather than fix the job in the first place. Clearly, there is a need to give priority to some of those projects that are causing present delays and problems.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Land Transport Development Amendment Bill amends the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988, the ALTD Act, to extend the operation of the Australian land transport development trust fund. This amendment will allow the $2.46 billion that the Commonwealth has allocated to fund roadworks on national highways over the next three calendar years to be funded from the current ALTD Act, until new legislation is in force governing the new roads program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will not alter the government's commitment to develop a new national highway act during 1994 to replace the ALTD Act of 1988. The national highway act will create a more efficient road management system, with potentially great benefits not just to the taxpayer and road users, but also to the economic growth of the nation as a whole. As part of this government's commitment to creating an appropriate roads administration program, a full consultative process is under way, involving state governments and major industry bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national highway bill for the post-1993 roads program is well on track, with consideration and passage likely in 1994. This is why it is necessary to amend the ALTD Act to extend its operation and ensure that the federal roads program can continue to be delivered until the new national highway bill is in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of this amendment will not alter the government's intention to fund the national highway system only from 1 January 1994. This commitment arose from the July 1991 Premiers Conference where it was agreed that road funding responsibility for each level of government should be more clearly defined and that each tier of government should concentrate on funding, planning and building roads that were clearly within their responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that state and local governments take on more responsibility for funding and operating the road systems that are their own responsibility. This should ensure a more efficient allocation of road funding, rather than simply looking to the federal government every year. It is also important to note that it was the states that wanted this role and agreed to it at the 1991 Special Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share the concerns raised earlier by the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) about how this will operate. The question of the actions of the states on this and a number of other issues relating to funding provided by the federal government raises real concerns about the use of untied grants to states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To provide the government with the ability to extend the current ALTD Act, three sunset clauses within the act require amendment: subsection 12(1) provides that road user revenue payments into the trust fund may only be made before 1 January 1994; subsection 12(2) provides that a proportion of refunds applicable to road user charges payable before 1 January 1994 be offset against road user charges payable into the trust fund; and section 25 provides that the trust fund shall be closed at the end of 30 June 1994. The provisions of this amendment remove each of these final dates and give effect to a continuation of current ALTD trust fund arrangements. The proposed new national highway act would contain provisions for the closure of the ALTD trust fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to details of the bill, clauses 1 and 2 contain the usual citation and commencement provisions. Clause 3(a) of the bill provides for the continuation of road user charge revenue payments into the trust fund beyond the date of 1 January 1994, which would otherwise apply. Clause 3(b) of the bill likewise provides for the continuation of the provision contained in subsection 12(2) of the act such that the proportion of refunds applicable to road user charges payable after 31 December 1993 be offset against road user charges payable into the trust fund. Clause 4 of the bill provides for the continuation of the ALTD trust fund for an indefinite period or until it is repealed by the inclusion of an appropriate clause in a new act for administration of the federal roads program. The trust fund would otherwise close at the end of 30 June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land transport and the public capital expenditure associated with it are usually spoken of in terms of micro-economic reform. However, the macro-economic effects of road expenditure must not be underestimated. The federal government has shown, especially since the One Nation statement, its commitment to providing the necessary investment in public infrastructure and, through the development of the national highway act, an increased efficiency in the application of that investment. I quote from an article in the September 1992 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Economist</EMPHASIS>, entitled `The Case for Central Planning':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liberal (i.e. conservative) thinking has ruled economic policy for the past decade. It is no coincidence that the 1980's were also a time of diminishing public investment in infrastructure. Governments rallied against public spending of most sorts&mdash;and, by and large, rightly so. But they sometimes failed to distinguish between useful spending programs and wasteful ones.</PARA>
<PARA>This was speaking in an international context but there are also some relevant considerations to the Australian experience. I quote further from the same source:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adequate infrastructure well used, undoubtedly promotes economic growth. To get these benefits in full, government must take charge&mdash;always making as much use of market forces and private enterprise as possible, but never seeking to shirk their responsibility as chief executive.</PARA>
<PARA>A key element of the new arrangements under the national highway act is that the allocation of funds to the national highway will be determined on the basis of national priorities. It is therefore entirely possible that states may not have consistent proportions of NHS funding over time. National priorities require a national approach; they cannot be left to eight state and territory governments and countless local governments. That would cause inefficiencies due to disparity of approach, parochialism and a lack of proper consideration of the needs of the nation. Clel Harrall from the World Bank explains the relationship between investment in highway stocks and private sector output as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Roads like any transport investment, operate fundamentality by reducing economic distance between spatially separated markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . .<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By reducing the costs of commercial or social interaction between diverse regions their different resource bases can be exploited to the mutual benefit of each according to the laws of comparative advantage. The more different the resource endowments of the various regions, the greater will be the benefits of specialisation permitted by improved transport&mdash;as is most obviously illustrated by the differences between cities and agricultural areas.</PARA>
<PARA>He could have been talking about Australia, especially about our national system. Agricultural industries in Australia will be boosted by better roads and access to ports, et cetera. We have to work on that in a continuing way as a national priority. Manufacturing zones will also benefit through better linkages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US has led the world in macro-economic road investment models. While both the government and the opposition in Australia have used, for example, the Murphy modelling processes to examine, for instance, Fightback, the use of similar modelling processes to examine the macro-effects of road spending has perhaps not received the attention that it should. One US study of this type showed an extremely high correlation between per capita income growth and highway capacity and pavement quality, because highway facilities raise the level of transportation services that are available to producers, which in turn stimulates investment to utilise these facilities. The OECD has conducted similar studies and, overall, these have shown a similar correlation between productivity and infrastructure investment. The correlation exists especially in countries with similar conditions to Australia in geographic size and population dispersion&mdash;for example, Canada. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has led the way with programs such as black spots, the urban public transport program and the rural highways and provincial cities program. Those programs have provided jobs and economic growth in the areas they affected and have reduced accident levels, resulting in government savings in a wide range of areas. The results of these programs, particularly the economic and social benefits, should now be clear to the other levels of government. They wanted responsibility for roads. They should pick up the ball and run with it. It is also important to note that even after the expiry of these programs road funding levels will still be above the historic average level of funding by federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A growing number of economic theorists are acknowledging the role of road infrastructure in macro-economic terms, and not just overseas. For example, researchers at Monash University have calculated that the net present benefits to the community for carrying out safety improvements to 82 intersections in Melbourne, for an investment of around $7.5 million, would be $66.2 million. That resultant saving basically relates to a reduction in accidents and the enormous costs that they bring to the community. Phil Raskall estimated the cost to the community of one suicide at $0.5 million. The cost of road deaths must be of the same order of magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">States must realise the benefits of this spending and act. In my electorate, black spot funding has been a very important part of local infrastructure development in the last 12 months. I think over $1 million was spent in Corinella, providing improvements to the highway to Phillip Island, to a number of railway crossings in the Cranbourne and Dandenong South parts of the electorate and also to traffic lights in the Cranbourne area. The states also have to take up this responsibility and run with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the federal government's commitment to the black spots program, I was very disappointed to see in this budget that we did not fund black spots. I will be urging the government to reinstigate that program in the coming year and to work towards continuing it as an important part of the government's approach to roads. But, again, as a result of the Premiers Conference the role of the states in those areas and the points raised by the honourable member for Charlton earlier about states siphoning off money that has been delegated to road funding have to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the federal government's strategic approach to road funding and transport planning in the future, it was recently announced that a national transport planning task force would be formed. It was announced, as I understand it, through the policy statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) prior to the federal election, and has since been acted upon. Three people have been appointed to that committee: Mr Ian Webber, chairman of Mayne Nickless Ltd; Mr Lance Hockridge, group general manager of BHP Transport; and Dr Derek Scrafton, director general of transport from South Australia. They are all people with real, lasting experience in the industry and great knowledge of the transport needs of this country. I think they will perform a crucial role in making sure that the government gets its transport priorities right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NTPT is to focus principally on the interstate movement of freight and will have two primary functions. Firstly, it is to perform a strategic role in assessing the future pattern of transport demand, planned infrastructure investment to meet those demands, including alternative sources, and the broader economic costs and benefits of increased transport infrastructure investment. Secondly, the NTPT will look at all aspects of intermodal issues, especially the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the interface between land transport and sea and air transport infrastructure. However, broader international freight issues will be considered in other forms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force is to have regard in its work for the social and environmental impact of the transport system and the maintenance and enhancement of safety standards. This strategic approach, involving experience from within the industry, should put us in a position whereby the priorities that we set nationally for the national highway system and national transport plans are the right ones and take into account the needs of the community and of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the bill we have before us today is to maintain the current commitment to a national strategy agreed to by the Premiers Conference. The new national highway act is being developed and will be implemented in a consultative manner. We have, through the national transport planning task force, an approach for the future which will put us in good stead. As I said earlier, I am concerned about the role of the states in the funding of roads. Untied grants, in my experience in Victoria in recent times, have not been a satisfactory way of approaching national priorities, although I understand that many of the priorities we are setting are state priorities. I am concerned about the way the states will actually implement those initiatives. The federal government has a continuing commitment to the future of the national priorities for national transport initiatives. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

The honourable member for Flinders can tell them that they have been given a rap in the House.

It commits the federal government to the ongoing program of in excess of $2 billion during the next three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of the comments that have been made have touched on two issues in particular: black spots and the fuel excise question. On black spots, I think there is general acceptance across all levels of government that the treatment of particular accident sites, focusing on the ones where accidents, deaths and serious injuries have been occurring, and specifically doing something about those sites one by one, has been dramatically successful. When the program was put in place, it was funded, principally, by the federal government with the view of demonstrating to state governments and local councils that spending money on these particular sites was a worthwhile investment. Both the statistics and the amount of work that has been done through the project have indicated that it is highly worthwhile spending. We have now asked the states and local government to commit themselves to continuing that program from their own funds, with the federal government already having led the way with almost $300 million. The New South Wales state government has already, as I understand it, said it will do that. There are a number of other state governments and local government authorities working their way through to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Corinella, in his comments, made the point that within the government he intends to argue for the development of a new program of this kind. I think I can say at this point that there is a lot of support in the government for the federal government maintaining a role of this kind in the drive towards lowering the road toll and in road safety issues. The comments of the honourable member for Corinella are well made. As the budget position eases and more opportunities arise, this program will be given future consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I think just about everything has been said that needs to be said on the question of fuel excise. I would say this particularly to the transport industry: there is no doubt that the principal beneficiary of an upward turn in the economy is the transport industry. It is one of the first to suffer any decline because goods and services do not move around the economy as fast. Road transport feels it first, in much the same way as does the building industry. As the economy comes out of recession, it is one of the industries that picks up first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has now negotiated the payment of the tax cuts through the Senate. The tax cuts represent a spending boost to the economy&mdash;which is coming out of recession&mdash;of well over $3 billion. In my view, the strength of recovery in the economy is going to be faster than the figures are now indicating. The transport sector will be one of the principal beneficiaries of that improvement. There are already strains on the capacity of that sector to cope. It is possible to say that the increased fuel excise may not be the problem to the industry that it predicts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that if the government is going to provide tax cuts&mdash;and they are sought in the community&mdash;they must be funded. To some extent, some of that funding is coming from the increased excise, but not all. One ought to remind the community in general that the tax cuts are in the order of $4 billion; the fuel excise will raise around $1 billion. The fuel tax aspect is only one of the components of the mix. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that the time for discussion of this legislation expires shortly. I think all that needs to be said has been said.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSL was established in 1916 as an arm of the quarantine service so that Australia could be self-sufficient in pharmaceuticals at a time of isolation, especially during periods of war.

These changes also allowed the establishment of subsidiaries, joint ventures and partnerships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL now manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceutical and veterinary products both in Australia and overseas and has a wide range of connections of a research and development nature with various foreign companies which are assisting them in this objective. In 1990, CSL was made a corporation with its own board of directors. Since then it has operated largely on a commercial footing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By any measure CSL has been an Australian success story. The coalition's longstanding policy even prior to 1990 has been to privatise CSL so that it would have the advantages of being off-budget in the true sense of the term and have the capacity of attracting greater capital, which has always been one of its major shortcomings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company is now export oriented and has a research development division. It is based at Parkville in Victoria, it employs 1,200 people and has branches in each mainland state. It is awaiting the completion and accreditation of a major advanced blood fractionation plant at Broadmeadows which will make it amongst the world's most up-to-date facilities. CSL has assets of $240 million and sales in 1992-93 exceeded $170 million, an increase of $10 million on the previous financial year. In 1992-93 net profit rose by 42 per cent to $13.8 million, up from $9.7 million in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1992-93 budget the government announced its intention to fully privatise CSL Ltd subject to CSL remaining under independent Australian control. As far as the coalition is concerned, this decision is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSL Sale Bill which we are debating is therefore very important to see the interaction between the capacity to float off this organisation and ensuring the national interest. Preparations for CSL's public float involve the due diligence process, a public awareness campaign and, ultimately, the launch of the float. The due diligence process involves examining CSL's operations to provide potential investors with a complete picture of the company's financial position and future prospects. This also allows investment bankers to form a view about an appropriate price for the sale of shares as the basis for a prospectus inviting the community at large to invest in CSL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this connection I am concerned that the government clarifies CSL's contingent liability post-sale in relation to certain claims which may arise against the company. CSL's own insurance company, Coselco, with reserves of $30 million, carries CSL's product liability risk, which it reinsures wherever possible. In relation to new products and some existing products, Commonwealth liability will cease on sale of the company. However, CSL is still negotiating with the government on some outstanding indemnification issues relating to some vaccines and products distributed pre-sale. These negotiations are expected to be completed prior to CSL's sale. In fact, they must be completed prior to sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that as part of the due diligence process there should be a thorough audit of all conceivable claims against CSL. There is the question as to who will bear long-term liability for an unknown number of claims which may arise in relation to numerous drugs and vaccines. It is essential that this issue is clarified prior to sale and that the prospectus gives as accurate a picture as possible of CSL's contingent liability in respect of such claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, liability rests with the Commonwealth in relation to claims against CSL arising from a number of its products, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a fatal brain disease linked to the use of a drug manufactured by the company; AIDS contracted from infected blood products manufactured by CSL some years ago; the side effects of pertussis vaccine, a component of triple antigen injections, which vaccinates against whooping cough; and hepatitis infection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, risks relating to these drugs cannot be insured or completely covered on the open market. Therefore, the issue is real in terms of the actual value of CSL. I am advised that it is intended that the Commonwealth indemnity in relation to these diseases will continue after the sale of the company, although this matter has still to be settled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare brain disorder which has affected some participants in the Australian human pituitary hormone program. The fertility drug human pituitary gonadotrophin, or HPG, was manufactured by CSL. Between 1967 and 1985 about 2,100 Australians were supplied with cadaver derived pituitary hormones. One-thousand five-hundred women were treated for infertility and 600 children were treated for short stature, or dwarfism. HPG was recalled in 1985 when authorities decided it was too dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CJD is a disease of the central nervous system which causes dementia and muscle wastage and can exist in someone's system for up to 30 years before becoming active. Regrettably, there is no diagnostic test, nor at this stage any known cure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As of yesterday, there were 21 writs lodged in the Victorian Supreme Court, of which three were by husbands of deceased participants in this program and 18 were by recipients of both HPG and HGH. Many writs relate to stress associated with fear of contracting CJD following the taking of growth hormone or follicle stimulating drugs. As I said, this fear could exist for 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As of May, four Australian women treated with HPG while being treated for infertility have died. At least one person in my electorate was treated with HPG, as a consequence of which she and her family have suffered considerable anguish. She does not know whether or not she is infected, and nobody can tell her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March this year I made representations to the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, on the matter. My colleague the shadow finance minister, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) has also drawn attention to the link between CJD and the administering of HPG. As a result of our efforts, the government belatedly announced an inquiry in May this year into CJD and the use of pituitary derived hormones in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also accepted that its present indemnity with respect to CJD claims will continue after the public float and will be reflected in an agreement between the CSL and the Commonwealth. As I stated earlier, this agreement has not yet been completed and it should be tabled in the parliament. I believe Senator Richardson has given an undertaking to this effect and that this indemnity will be referred to in the prospectus for the CSL sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be understood, however, that it is likely that more CJD claims, particularly for trauma, will come forward, possibly for as long as 50 years. If successful, such claims could obviously reduce the long-term benefits of the sale of CSL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also advised it is intended that the Commonwealth retain post-sale liability for claims against CSL for the contraction of AIDS as a result of treatment with contaminated blood products. In the mid-1980s, CSL was sued for compensation by haemophiliacs who contracted AIDS following treatment with blood products such as clotting agents used to treat their condition. CSL was also sued by a number of women who contracted AIDS following sexual intercourse with such men. However, I am informed that the risk of further claims against CSL for AIDS is not high due to improved screening processes. I am also advised that CSL has asked the Commonwealth to continue indemnity post-sale. I am informed that it is intended the Commonwealth indemnity also be extended to cover post-sale claims against CSL for hepatitis infection. Again, this needs to be clarified and codified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation with respect to liability for pertussis vaccine is more complex. Pertussis vaccine is a component of the triple antigen injection or DPT&mdash;diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus injection&mdash;which vaccinates against whooping cough. In the mid-1970s it was suggested that the pertussis vaccine may be associated with permanent brain damage. Since then the side-effects of pertussis vaccine have remained a subject of controversy in medical circles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pertussis vaccine has been accused of causing cases of sudden infant death syndrome, leukemia, multiple sclerosis and other disorders. It is not for me to judge whether pertussis vaccine has such side effects. But I think it makes the point, however, that the issue is very much open and no final determination has been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am concerned about, however, is the liability of the government and CSL post-sale, with respect to liability, should any such claims against CSL succeed. Currently, proceedings have been initiated in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against a doctor who administered pertussis vaccine. The case, which alleges that brain damage resulted from administration of the vaccine, will be heard later this year or early next year. There are two other claims against doctors who administered the vaccine in New South Wales and one in Victoria which are likely to come forward in the near future. There are also three cases running in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL was and is the distributor of pertussis vaccine. It is quite possible that the doctors involved in these claims will join action against the supplier. All claims are in relation to brain damage and are for amounts of between $3 million and $4 million each. There are an unknown number of such cases Australia-wide. Once the cases currently before the courts receive publicity, one can reasonably presume that undoubtedly others will come forward. There could be hundreds of people involved, as Australia endeavoured to vaccinate every child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised the proposal is that the government will retain its current liability post-sale for pertussis vaccine distributed pre-sale, and that CSL will accept liability for product distributed following the sale. I am also advised that, in relation to pertussis vaccine, the Commonwealth currently indemnifies claims up to an amount of $1 million and above $25 million per claim. The extent to which any successful claim exceeds $1 million is covered by the insurance policy&mdash;$1 million being the excess payable on the insurance cover. The limit of this cover is $25 million per claim, after which the Commonwealth again becomes liable. This issue must be given proper consideration, codified and presented clearly in the CSL prospectus, as it could well be a significant area of future litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL has also distributed pluserix MMR, a vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. Last year the government was asked to establish an inquiry into the possible links between pluserix MMR, which has now been banned,</PARA>
<PARA>and cases of brain damage and meningitis in children. Pluserix MMR was withdrawn by Australian health authorities in May 1991 because of links with meningitis. I am advised that there is no plan for the government to indemnify CSL for claims in relation to pluserix MMR because this is currently reinsurable. CSL will therefore cover itself against such claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another group called the HIB vaccines. The haemophilus influenza type B, or HIB, is a leading cause of meningitis and epiglotitis in children. HIB vaccines are relatively new vaccines administered to babies over two months old and I am advised that CSL has distributed HIB vaccines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the company entered into a joint venture with Merck, Sharpe and Dohme and Merck &amp; Co., USA, to develop a new range of vaccine combinations. One of these combinations will involve combining CSL's triple antigens with Merck, Sharpe and Dohme supplied hepatitis B and HIB vaccine components. HIB vaccines have been accused of side effects such as increased susceptibility to infectious disease. I understand that CSL currently has insurance cover for HIB and has not asked the government to indemnify it against any claims arising from HIB vaccines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, of course, two sides to this debate about the benefits of vaccines. In relation to pertussis vaccine, CSL has stated that both the medical and legal evidence shows there is no increased risk of children who receive the pertussis vaccine developing either acute or chronic neurological diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL has an outstanding reputation. It is constantly monitoring and refining the quality of its products, and this certainly should be kept in mind. Against this, CSL has conceded that there are as yet no perfect vaccines and that every vaccine has some small incidence of side effects. The point in relation to liability surely is this: vaccination is continuing; any side effects of vaccines may not become apparent for up to 20 or 30 years; and litigation in relation to alleged side effects is an expanding field, particularly in the United States, but seemingly here in Australia as well. My sole concern in this debate is that the government take all such cases into account when it determines outstanding indemnification issues prior to the sale of CSL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the health minister is yet to approve Commonwealth indemnification for post-sale judgments against CSL arising from the above vaccines and products, although he has given certain assurances in relation to CJD. I would enjoin both Senator Richardson and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) to do their utmost to ensure that all outstanding issues of liability are addressed properly prior to the float. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's indemnification with respect to certain CSL products such as CJD is currently a full indemnification, whereas its indemnification, say, in relation to pertussis vaccine, is clearly different. I am advised that the government will be asked to indemnify CSL post-sale along the lines I have indicated for various products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition believes government has a clear duty to spell out the limits of its liabilities with respect to all products as this could amount to a continuing open chequebook indemnification of CSL in the event of a series of adverse judgments against the company. The government must also ensure that potential share purchasers are informed of the situation regarding liability in the sale prospectus. In short, the government must spell out exactly what it and CSL will and will not be liable for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will be moving an amendment dealing with this issue, as well as with the issue of employee shareholding. I therefore move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government to ensure that all issues of contingent liability are properly assessed, addressed and declared prior to the float of CSL Ltd and that the Board and management of CSL Ltd encourage broad employee shareholding in CSL Ltd".</PARA>
<PARA>I refer now to the method of sale. The government's decision to sell 100 per cent of its shares in CSL, announced in the 1992-93 budget, stipulated a five per cent limit on individual foreign shareholding. This was confirmed in the last budget. Legislation before the House addresses the issue of CSL remaining under Australian control by means of certain national interest provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill limits the voting rights of significant foreign shareholders with regard to appointment, replacement and removal of company directors. It requires that CSL remain incorporated in Australia, and that the company's chairman and two-thirds of its board are Australian citizens. These provisions will ensure that CSL remains under the direction of an Australian controlled board. The bill also requires that CSL's head office and principal fractionation activities be located in Australia so that we remain independent of overseas suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the heading `National Interest Provisions', the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) also outlined arrangements for the sale of CSL shares. At the point of sale there will be a limit of five per cent on individual shareholdings, domestic or foreign; an aggregate limit of 15 to 20 per cent on foreign shareholdings; and preference for individuals and institutions over corporate shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This represents a substantial watering down of the government's position on foreign ownership as stated in the last two budgets. In fact, as soon as CSL shares are traded on the stock exchange, foreigners will be able to acquire more than five per cent individually and more than 15 to 20 per cent in aggregate. In reality, the limitations on foreign shareholdings as such will apply only to the initial float. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian control of CSL will be preserved only by the restrictions on the composition of the CSL board and the general provisions of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. The opposition believes this dilution of government policy on foreign ownership in this case is perhaps sensible. However, I wonder why the government is placing conditions on the method of float which will be superseded immediately the initial sale is over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Theoretically, this temporary limitation on foreign ownership could result in the Commonwealth losing potential revenue from the sale of CSL. This would seem to be a face-saving exercise, allowing the government to represent itself as keeping its word to limit individual foreign shareholdings to five per cent. In reality, however, I believe most of the interest in the float of CSL will be domestic in any case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it would be better, if the method by which shares in CSL are allocated is to be prescribed, to provide for some employee shareholding. The opposition believes the ownership of shares involving corporate ownership, in the sense of shareholdings owned by employees, is a matter of fundamental importance which regrettably has not been adequately covered publicly by the government in documentation to date. Provision for employee share purchases in government asset sales has been addressed on a case by case basis, taking into account union and employee concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer on this legislation makes no mention of employee shareholding in relation to CSL. I also note an answer given by Senator McMullan, representing the Minister for Finance, to a question on notice in the Senate. He stated that, as at 30 August 1993, the government had taken no decisions with regard to an employee share scheme or other arrangements. That is why I mentioned this question of employee shareholding as part of our amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that in the lead-up to this float CSL management should fully exploit the opportunity to allow CSL employees to obtain a stake in their own company. I am advised that the CSL board has taken an in-principle decision in favour of an employee share scheme and has referred the issue to CSL management. In this connection, I note with approval that CSL's most recent staff newsletter states that at the appropriate time&mdash;whenever that may be&mdash;staff will be advised about special arrangements being made for their acquisition of shares. I am also advised that as yet there has been no decision on allocation policy, although DIR guidelines require an equitable allocation of shares among employees. Unlike the government, the opposition believes passionately that employees should be encouraged to take a stake in their company. Accordingly, I have moved an amendment to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to make some comments in regard to CSL's research capability. Last year the company made a 35 per cent increased investment in research and development, from $14 million to $19 million. However, I believe that CSL should have an even greater research capability if it wants to be more than merely a bit player in the megabucks international pharmaceutical industry. Presently CSL would have a net value of approximately $200 million to $300 million. As I said, it is a very small player in terms of its international competitors. As CSL's managing director, Dr Brian McNamee, said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> earlier this month:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not in the discovery end of the business. We're strong in development and strong in collaboration with companies and academic institutes.</PARA>
<PARA>It is worth noting that Victoria has three private research companies doing state-of-the-art research, including AMRAD, which will be floated in the next two years.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there could be a potential advantage in linking CSL's production capability with a research based company such as AMRAD. I believe that the two have already discussed the possibility of collaborative projects. However, this is a practical issue and its future will be determined by market forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the opposition, I wish CSL the very best of luck with this privatisation. There is no doubt that it is an outstanding organisation and it is worth noting that Dr McNamee has established an excellent standard of administration of the company. In 1991 CSL received the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Business</EMPHASIS> magazine's best government business enterprise award for being the best performer among all government business enterprises in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, in recent years CSL has opened a new penicillin dispensing and packaging facility and a new animal vaccine plant. This new $200 million blood fractionation plant at Broadmeadows, towards which the Commonwealth contributed $150 million, is highly capital intensive and is a world leader in its class. The plasma products produced will represent half of CSL's revenues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL has developed strategic alliances involving more than 70 licences, agreements and deals with drug companies and local research centres, including SmithKline Beecham, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, Cutter Laboratories, Biotech Australia and Hoechst. CSL's transition to privatisation has been arguably the smoothest yet for a government enterprise, especially when we are looking at a field where its record so far has been less than outstanding. It has been consistently profitable in recent years, and this is in large part due to the efforts of the management and staff of the company. I congratulate them all on this achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL now has a new outlook for the future, and with that it must have a new culture. This legislation will remove CSL from administrative and legislative requirements of GBEs, to enable sale and to protect certain employee entitlements. The actual timing of the float is expected to be around March or April 1994, depending on the timing of other major stock market floats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has consistently initiated and led the debate on the need for the privatisation of government assets, including the CSL.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with mixed feelings that I enter this debate because, in past debates in this place, I have placed on record my opposition to the sale of CSL. I remember that in 1990, when CSL was converted to a public company, I spoke of the fear that I and some of my colleagues had that conversion to a public company was a precursor to CSL's eventual sale. That has now been proved right on the basis of the decision made in the budget of 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, when I look around I do not seem to see too many fellow travellers, so I have to accept that the inevitable will happen later in this financial year.

Back in 1990 they well and truly used the opportunity to push the privatisation barrow, with CSL being used as an example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that I was impressed by the attitude of the honourable member for Bradfield to the debate today. I think he covered some important things that need to be looked at in the process that is being put in place for the sale of CSL. I think that they are things that the government will have to take on board. I do agree with him that it is very important to Australia, very important to the development of an Australian pharmaceutical industry, that we have CSL as a main player that builds on the strengths that it has developed since it came into being in 1916, that builds on the strengths that abound in a number of areas of research within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards the end of his speech the honourable member mentioned AMRAD. I think that from time to time we need to remind people in this place that not everything that occurred under the stewardship of the previous Victorian government turned sour. AMRAD was well and truly encouraged in the early years of the Cain government and is very much a success and recognised as such. It is very important that not only AMRAD but also CSL and others that are the players in developing a pharmaceutical industry use the strengths that abound as a result of that research effort. Those strengths abound in actually a very small sector of Melbourne, around the Parkville region, where there is a concentration of a number of research institutes that do work with pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later in my speech I want to mention government policies that have been very important in developing and strengthening Australia's pharmaceutical industry. It is appropriate in the context of this debate, with CSL hopefully, whether it transfers from public to private ownership, remaining very much a successful entity in that development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bradfield also outlined some of the very important things in which CSL has been involved. Of course, it started for obvious reasons. Australia was isolated during the First World War. There was a need that we should not be at the mercy of other nations for our vaccines and sera. Therefore, right from the start serving the national interest was always very important for CSL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL went on, as is well known, to develop and be involved in things that were specifically Australian&mdash;problems such as developing anti-venoms to a number of Australian pests. In 1923, CSL was only one of four laboratories in the world which produced insulin. In 1944, the work and efforts of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories meant that Australia became the first nation in the world to be able to supply its civilian population with penicillin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This national interest objective was confirmed in 1961 when CSL became a statutory authority. The charter specifically mentioned that it should deal with issues that were in the national interest. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, as I have said earlier, mentioned a number of positive things about CSL in his second reading speech. He made one comment that I have a little difficulty in agreeing with. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public float of CSL will enable it to achieve this potential and will release the Commonwealth from its incongruous position of being owner, as well as customer and regulator of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe the Commonwealth's three roles should have impinged on what was occurring with CSL in its association with the wider pharmaceutical industry and the PBS. I think the things which had been done, such as making it a public company and the different arms-length ways of regulating, were sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, one of the questions asked is: why does the Commonwealth need to own a pharmaceutical company? We can then answer: why should it not own a pharmaceutical company? Why should it not be involved in something that is very successful? The intriguing thing about most of those companies that are put forward for transfer from public to private ownership is that, in the main, they are fairly successful going concerns. We do not put up too many dud companies for that sort of sale. If we did that, we would not attract purchasers. So I think we should be in the business of working on the successes of a number of government concerns, recognising that those government business enterprises in their genesis operated in the national interest and developed in areas where the private sector, in those days, would not develop, such as telecommunications, postal services and airline services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that should be said is that there is a return to budget. A number of figures have been quoted earlier in the debate as to the profits of the company and also the return to the Commonwealth by way of dividend. I recognise that, especially over the last few years, CSL has been very much involved in developing an international outlook. There has been more recognition of the potential for export sales. If we look now at CSL's revenue, we can see that over 10 per cent of it comes from export sales and there are plans for extending this in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international division of CSL is currently looking at establishing itself in Europe and North America, with a view to developing niche markets for biologically based products manufactured in Australia. During the past year, CSL has been responsible for investing over $18 million in new R&amp;D. CSL has modern procedures in place to identify new products for development and manufacture. CSL is developing those processes to select opportunities which give it a strong market position without many competitors in the regions and markets that it is looking to be involved in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking about those new processes for developing and identifying new product, CSL in the past had perhaps fallen into the habit of reacting to problems as they came along and reacting within what it thought was the limit of its capacity to tackle those problems.

That is a very sophisticated and state-of-the-art facility. Before the sale of the company, the Commonwealth and CSL will have to come to an agreement about placing the ownership of that facility in the company's hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at CSL's performance, one sees the need within the pharmaceutical industry for a very interventionist industry policy by government. If one flicks through its statements, one can see that it takes advantage of the 150 per cent tax concession on research and development, and that is important. It is important that there be encouragement not only in this sector of industry, but also right across the board. Looking at the health of the industry overall, it has to be understood that I do not approach this on the basis that public ownership is the only type of intervention at which we should be looking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last decade there has been much debate which seems to be based on the notion that when we examine options for economic development one that we should perhaps shy away from is an interventionist type of government policy. Following the deregulation of the 1980s and the excesses that followed, more people are perhaps now realising that government policies which take an overtly interventionist approach are perhaps what we should be returning to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the pharmaceutical industry, we see that one of the most successful of the industry policies at the moment is the factor F scheme. That scheme means that the government, with its pricing controls through the PBS, has been able to involve itself in encouraging Australian drug manufacturers to develop wider plans within the industry. However, one problem that should be recognised is that because of the success of the PBS pricing mechanisms, which mean that Australian drug prices are about 50 or 60 per cent of the world average, drug manufacturers in Australia have quite rightly said that that well and truly acts as a disincentive for them to be players within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The factor F scheme has meant that spending by pharmaceutical companies on research and development decisions to increase manufacturing in Australia are then taken into account when making pricing decisions for pharmaceutical products. The companies which agree to increase Australian operation in respect of value added exports, value added domestic sales, and research and development are given payments representing notional price increases in the pharmaceutical products they manufacture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the financial year 1991-92, the government was able to grant price increases in the order of $26 million to the nine pharmaceutical companies then participating in the scheme. This was in return for more investment in manufacturing, research and development by these firms. The results of this scheme have been quite astounding. The latest Auditor-General's report into the administration of the factor F scheme summarised the outcomes on page 5 of that document. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the first stage, factor F companies were expected to increase Australian pharmaceutical activity by $860 million, comprising $533 million export sales, $211 million in domestic sales and $117 million in research and development.</PARA>
<PARA>Most importantly, the analysis of these figures indicates that the scheme has probably led to the creation of 470 jobs within the industry and a retention of something like 390 jobs. I think that is the important thing. As the report of the audit office indicates, those figures are something like 10 per cent of the current work force within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now starting to see, as the factor F scheme well and truly has an effect, a turnaround in the balance of trade on pharmaceutical items. That will be important right through the 1990s as that becomes even more significant. Based on the present figures and estimates, there will be slight increases in imports over the next few years. But that will be well and truly offset by rapid increases in the amount of exports. Later in this decade, this will lead to not only that continuing rapid increase in exports but also a diminution of the necessity for imports on the basis of import replacement. I think that that is dramatic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only major competitors in our region are the Japanese companies. Therefore, at the moment within the region, purchasers have two locations that they can consider for their regional manufacturing operations&mdash;and of course factor F is putting in place a mechanism that ensures that Australia can get its fair share of that type of development. As these things continue, I think it is important that not only in pharmaceutical industries but in wider industry policy development we not be too coy about saying that government has a role and that government can set in place mechanisms that assist the orderly development of those industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the annual report of the CSL, we see another mechanism the government has put in place that I think really needs to be recognised. I refer to cooperative research centres. CSL has become involved again on the basis of its strengths within the biotechnology pharmaceutical community. CSL became a foundation member of the biopharmaceutical research centre, which is a CSL program focused on development of biopharmaceuticals. Again, when we look at those types of mechanisms, we have to recognise the importance of the totality of the government's involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I recognise&mdash;as I did in 1990&mdash;Brian McNamee's role in the development of the CSL. I believe that we have seen, in what has happened since he has been there, a great development of what is truly a great company. I am sure that, even if it goes out of public ownership, it will continue to be a great company. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon, in discussing the privatisation proposal of the CSL in the CSL Sale Bill, I want to focus on the question that was raised by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), earlier in the debate, namely, the potential liability of CSL for an unfortunate tragedy which has caused considerable concern and hardship to a number of Australian women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A near neighbour of mine, whilst living in Britain with her husband who had been transferred there with his job, developed suddenly and without warning a fatal brain disease which is known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. She died in 1990. It appeared the reason that she had died was that she had been treated in Australia with a drug known as human pituitary derived gonadotrophin, otherwise known as HPG. The drug was manufactured by CSL. It was administered under a Commonwealth program which was run by a committee of experts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The connection between the fertility drug treatment and the death of the woman with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&mdash;CJD&mdash;was made because at the time she was living near Oxford where there was a world authority on this particular disease who knew the connection between the drug and the disease. The husband of the woman contacted me and informed me of her very untimely death, which had left him a widower and left his two daughters motherless. He asked whether, on his behalf, I could investigate what was known in Australia about this drug and its connection with the disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in July of 1991 and asked them for information: the number of cases of women who had been treated with this drug, the number of deaths, the known connections and whether there was any treatment. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories wrote back to me, confirmed the basic facts and provided me with an extract from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian and New Zealand Journal of Medicine</EMPHASIS> detailing that in Australia there had been one fatality in 1988 of a woman in Adelaide who had been treated with this fertility drug. The second fatality was the woman whom I had known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was clear that in 1991 CSL and the Commonwealth health authorities were not aware of the second fatality, Jenny Halford. As a result, I alerted the health authorities and, indeed, raised in this parliament in November 1991 the matter of the second Australian fatality. The woman had been treated with a drug manufactured by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, administered under a Commonwealth health program, and had died because the drug had been contaminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This drug was being produced from pituitary glands of dead bodies. Apparently, for some time there had been what was called the harvesting of pituitary glands from dead bodies in Australia. From those pituitary glands, the human fertility drug HPG was manufactured and also another drug used to treat dwarfism in children called human growth hormone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of deaths overseas, the program was suspended in 1985 and there has been no treatment since then. In relation to Jenny Halford's death, the time between treatment with the fertility drug and death was about 15 years. It occurred to me that, if women were still being treated with that drug until 1985 and between the treatment and the onset of the disease and ultimate death&mdash;for this is an incurable disease, not treatable and always fatal&mdash;there could be other Australian women who were and still are at risk. I urged the Commonwealth department of health to take immediate steps to notify the women involved and to offer them counselling. I also urged the government to look at the question of compensation to that family who had suffered the loss of a mother and a wife as a result of this treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the information that I have been able to glean from questions on notice and answers given, the department of health suspended the program in 1985 and informed doctors that there was a possible link between the drug HPG and CJD. The department took the view that doctors should notify their patients and that this would be an acceptable way of ensuring that patients were informed about the risk. Although the department wrote again to doctors in 1990, by June 1992 only 352 of the 1,500 or so women who were potentially at risk had actually been notified. What was clear was that, although the department had written to doctors, the information was not getting from the doctors to the patients concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeatedly requested in this House, through the media, and to the people concerned, that the department directly notify the women because to get onto this program they needed the approval of the Commonwealth government health authority. The authority had all the details of those who had been treated. In answers to questions that were provided to me, I was told that the doctors were given information and asked to exercise their clinical judgment in relation to notification and counselling. In answers to questions on 7 July 1992, the health minister said that, in each case, medical practitioners provided counselling as appropriate according to their clinical judgment. It appeared to me that the clinical judgment of some of these doctors had been not to notify the women at all because only 352 women had been notified of this potential risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also important to notify the women because it was conceivable that there had been other Australian deaths. The department had found out about the second death only because I happened to know the woman. It was conceivable that other Australian women had died from CJD without it ever being diagnosed. That is why it was important to contact them directly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also important to contact them directly because the balance of medical opinion is that a person with the CJD agent can pass it on through tissue or organ donations. There is also a suggestion that it can be passed on through blood donations. Potentially, Australian women who had been treated with this drug and were therefore at risk, could unknowingly donate blood or organs and pass the disease on. That is why it was very important that they knew that they should not take the risk of passing on the disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to further questions on notice, which I received on 25 June 1992, I was informed that the batches that were supposed to be contaminated could not be isolated. The Commonwealth Department of Health regarded all batches as potentially infected, which meant that all the 1,500 women were potentially at risk. It also appeared that it was not until 1990 that the blood banks of Australia were told that they should not take blood donations from women who had been treated with HPG. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program was cancelled in 1985 because it was known that there was a potential risk, but it took five full years before the blood banks were notified that people treated with HPG should be excluded, and HPG was printed as an exclusion for potential blood donors. We should bear in mind that the two fatalities had occurred after an interval of 15 years. So not only was there a large number of women at immediate risk, but for some time thereafter there was a risk of passing the disease on through organ or blood donations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 11 May 1993, Senator Richardson announced that there would be an inquiry. I welcome that inquiry. It is to run for about 12 months and we expect it to report next year. We hope that it gets to the bottom of this saga. The inquiry is to be undertaken by Professor Margaret Allars, the Associate Professor of Law at Sydney University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to further questions that I put on notice, and which were answered on 8 September 1993&mdash;I asked how many deaths there had been in Australia&mdash;the department was still maintaining that there had been only two deaths: Jane Allender in Adelaide in 1988, and Jenny Halford. We now know that there have been at least four deaths, including the death of Mrs Cummings in 1991. This was found out because her mother-in-law read an advertisement in a women's magazine and sought information from the Commonwealth Department of Health. It was years after Mrs Cummings' death that it was discovered that she had died from CJD as a result of fertility treatment. There is now known to be a fourth fatality, a woman in Perth in 1990. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Special Minister of State. Is it a fact that the government's proposed Mabo legislation will allow native title to coexist with other forms of title in some circumstances? Is it a fact that the Australian Bankers Association has written to the Prime Minister and other ministers to say that coexistence would reduce the security available to lenders?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9T4">Mr WALKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact of life in Australia is that native title has coexisted with other forms of title since first settlement. Many acts of parliament around this country specially reserve native title rights in pastoral and other leases. The habitation of most of our tribal people throughout the north of Australia is on pastoral leases. Either specific reservations written into a statute or into a pastoral lease or practice over the centuries has allowed the coexistence of native title. It is a concept that Australians have felt very good about for a long time; otherwise Aboriginal people, particularly tribal people, would have been thrown off their lands in the north of Australia in the same way as they were dispossessed in the rest of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a concept that most Australians find very easy to understand and to accept. It is a concept that is very much incorporated in the proposed bill. Just as these pastoral leases that are being used for mining all around the country at the moment have these reservations coexisting with Aboriginal people, so the government proposes that it happen. I think that those members of the Australian Bankers Association who are suggesting that there will be some loss of investment as a result of a concept that has already existed in this country for centuries are simply wrong.</PARA>

They appreciate just how wrong that letter from the bankers is because they appreciate that if we are not going to have any coexistence of native title we must extinguish it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Attorney-General. Is the Attorney-General aware of calls for the extinguishment of native title wherever it exists and of claims that proposals for a conversion of pastoral leases to a native title equivalent are really intended to create separate homelands for Aboriginal people? What are the government's intentions on these matters?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2644" SPEAKER="Lavarch The Hon M.H." NAMEID="LG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DICKSON" MINISTERIAL="ATTORNEY-GENERAL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think honourable members would be aware of calls from the Premier of Western Australia, apparently supported by at least some members of the federal Liberal Party of Australia, that all native title should be extinguished and replaced with some sort of statutory guarantee for traditional uses of the land, such as hunting, gathering and worship purposes, by Aboriginal and Islander people. The government does not accept this position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Mabo decision, the High Court of Australia effectively held that, for the last 200 years, governments have been extinguishing native title on the basis of the legal fiction that Australia was unoccupied at the time of British settlement. That legal fiction was not exposed until that decision was handed down last year. Now our legal systems and governments are obliged to accept the reality, which we always knew, that Aboriginal and Islander people did have an established and sophisticated system of traditions and customs which very much related to their position regarding the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that we know that, and our legal system recognises this basic fact, to say that governments should quite consciously decide to extinguish all remaining native title is a morally wrong proposition which is totally rejected by the government. I think it is totally rejected by fair-minded Australians, and I am pleased to say that it is also totally rejected at least in some sections of the federal Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even if the moral argument against such a proposition is rejected, is it necessary for either land management or the general economic good of this country that all native title should be extinguished? The answer to that is also, clearly, no. Because the government, in its Mabo proposal, puts forward a series of propositions which ensure that states maintain their traditional role in the control of land management in this system; and that existing statutory titleholders are fully protected, their titles secured and all rights which they currently enjoy, including, for example, renewals of existing leases, can be continued. We know that the proposal will allow full economic development&mdash;no special right of veto or anything of that nature is proposed by the government. So, against this background, why should the government entertain suggestions of the complete extinguishment of native title? Why would this be advanced by the opposition, except to be part of a continuing campaign of scaremongering and misinformation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another fine example of this being portrayed by the honourable member for Flinders. Yesterday, he encouraged honourable members to have regard to a speech he delivered over the weekend. I took up the good member's invitation and had a look at his speech, and it was very enlightening indeed. As well as continuing that same furphy about forum shopping, for which he was discredited last week, he goes on to make a second point about the government's proposal for the conversion of pastoral leases to a native title equivalent. In fairness to the honourable member, I will read what he says. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is sought&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the conversion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">by those who envisage separate homelands for Aborigines into which aspects of our legal system would not reach. Whilst all Australians, including Aboriginal Australians, are entitled to the enjoyment and protection of their property rights this proposal would create a property right that has been demanded for the political purpose of establishing a discriminatory legal system based on race.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the proposal of the honourable member for Flinders. Let me make a couple of points about this proposal so that the honourable member understands it clearly and the House understands it very clearly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the High Court said in the Mabo decision, which is not questioned by the government, that ultimate sovereignty for the land rests with the Crown; that is, with governments in this country. There was no suggestion that governments cannot deal with land as they see fit. So the suggestion that there can be some separate part of Australia where the overall governments of Australia cannot deal with land is fundamentally flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the proposal by the government for the conversion of pastoral leases would apply only in those cases where a pastoral lease has, of itself, extinguished the native title. That means that the only people able to convert a pastoral lease into a native title equivalent would be those Aboriginal and Islander people who, but for the pastoral lease, would have been able to establish native title. So it is not a question of someone who was unable to establish native title buying a pastoral lease and then converting it to native title. That relationship, which is necessary in terms of the test of the High Court, needs to be shown in order for this provision to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the government also made perfectly clear in the outline of 2 September that the general laws of the states and the Commonwealth would apply to native title land. So the idea that a separate homeland could be created, giving all sorts of inferences of apartheid, or something like that, has to be seen for what it is: an absolute attempt to cause fear and concern and to scaremonger. The honourable member for Flinders and the opposition, who are promoting this line, should be exposed for the grubby politics and the absolute fraud which proposals like this are.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just when they thought the Reef Tax had been resolved to fund sustainable management of the reef, they are faced with a fresh round of uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Macdonald is asking us to take seriously his allegation that proceeds from the reef tax will be used for compensation arising from native title claims perhaps similar to those which have been lodged over Green and Fitzroy islands off Cairns.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With Bronwyn Bishop calling for a referendum, she is clearly aligning herself with Richard Court isn't she?</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, I think Richard Court's actually moved on. He's moved on from a referendum, as I understand it.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday afternoon the Leader of the Opposition was asked by Mr Peter Kennedy on Perth radio:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well you initially poured, in fact, cold water on the referendum idea when it was first floated.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I never ruled it out.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday morning we had the Leader of the Opposition saying that the debate had moved on and in the afternoon saying that he had not ruled a referendum out. Not only is there confusion between Senator Bishop and the honourable member for Bennelong, but the Leader of the Opposition has difficulty between the morning and the afternoon. Senator Macdonald's claim is clearly laughable. The opposition is simply seeking to whip up confusion and to mount a scaremongering campaign on Mabo. What is very clear is that the opposition is putting its own partisan party political interest ahead of the national interest and ahead of the interests of the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make four points in response to Senator Macdonald's outrageous allegation. Native title claims will not take resort islands such as Green and Fitzroy islands from tourism operators or from tourists. The High Court stated clearly that native title was extinguished or impaired where it was inconsistent with a valid lease. If a tourism lease is invalid due to native title, the government has made it clear that we will validate the relevant commercial lease which affects tourism and extinguish any remaining native title. That legislation, of course, to validate the tourism and mining leases will go through only if the opposition votes for it. We are waiting to know whether or not it is going to vote to validate the mining and tourism leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's legislation, which the opposition may or may not vote for, will also ensure that the rights to enjoy beaches and other recreation areas, including national parks, will not be jeopardised. Daikyo has stated publicly that it is supremely confident there will be no adverse fallout for Green and Fitzroy islands. The government is not contemplating, in any shape or form, a proposal to use the proceeds from the reef tax for compensation for native title claimants. My colleague the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has made clear on many occasions that the $1 per visitor per day is to raise about a million dollars a year to help fund research and educational programs for the Great Barrier Reef. I suspect that the only reef tax that has upset the tourism industry is Peter Reith's tax&mdash;the GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I remind the opposition that in the High Court decision it was made very clear that native title claimants would have to show a continuing association with the land under claim. So unless the Leader of the Opposition is aware of an Aboriginal group that has a continuing association with Green Island, it is going to be rather difficult to establish native title claimants there. What the opposition and Senator Macdonald are really saying is that the Aborigines are not only under our beds, but under our beach umbrellas as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a great deal of time for the honourable member who asked the question because he has been very responsible in this debate as an eminent member of the legal profession and one of the few members of this House who have actually read the High Court's decision. Can I make these points to him and to the House: the High Court has decided that customary title, native title, exists in this country and has done from time immemorial&mdash;for millennia. It existed at the time the First Fleet arrived and it continued to exist after that time, except in so far as it has been extinguished by the acts of governments in granting titles over that land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and obvious point that needs to be made to correct the honourable member's misunderstanding of the High Court's decision is that there is no question of a statute of limitation about something that already exists.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2649" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Melbourne for his question. Today the Statistician revealed that the CPI for the September quarter rose by 0.5 per cent and, for the year to September, by 2.2 per cent. This means that Australia continues to have a low level of inflation compared with the rest of the world and it puts us right in line with the inflation rate of our major trading partners. As far as the underlying rate is concerned, Treasury's estimate is 0.7 per cent for the quarter and 2.3 per cent for the year to September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Low inflation is a major plank of the government's strategy for improving the economy, for sustaining the recovery and for ensuring that Australia continues to hang on to the substantial improvements that it has gained in terms of competitiveness in the international marketplace. This small rise, of course, is after accommodating some of the increases which were occasioned by a higher excise on tobacco arising from the budget and, indeed, some rises which came through from state and territory budgets, primarily those relating to tobacco products as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were also increases in transportation costs, state and local government charges and various food prices. These increases have all contributed to the rise. However, they have been partially offset by falls in mortgage interest rates and consumer credit charges, as well as some falls in the price of clothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time that the budget was put together the CPI growth for 1993-94 was estimated to be 3 1/2 per cent. However, taking into account today's lower than expected result, as well as changes which have been made in some areas of the government's revenue raising measures, particularly the sales tax on wine and so on, it is now anticipated that the forecast can be revised downwards to three per cent as the more likely figure. Treasury advises me that, with a forecast revision from 3 1/2 per cent to three per cent, the effect on the budget deficit will be marginal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important point about this low inflation is that not only are we recording low rates of inflation and not only is the underlying rate continuing to be low, but also the surveys of inflation expectations continue to be low, which obviously augurs well for a maintenance of low inflation into the future. I think this is good news. I was, however, a little intrigued by the shadow Treasurer's observation today. He seemed to have been all primed up for a large increase in the inflation rate and came out frothing at the mouth about this rise in inflation all being due to government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just lived through a couple of years where, as inflation has been trending down, the opposition has been saying, `This is nothing whatever to do with government policy; it is all due entirely to some other magical and mystical events', but, as soon as there is a tiny tick up in the rate of inflation, then it is entirely due to the policies of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just another example of the opposition trying to talk the country down, trying to diminish the fact that the country is doing better and the economy is strengthening. I know that it hurts the opposition massively to see Australia in a position where we have rates of growth and inflation which compare favourably with those of other countries around the world. Those opposite hate it, but I tell them the government is pleased with this result and I am quite sure the majority of the Australian people are as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Resume your seat. There have been times when the honourable member for Bennelong, because of his seniority in this place and the position that he holds, has been given some degree of latitude when coming to the dispatch box and, indeed, putting questions to the Speaker. On some of those occasions, he has gone very close to suggesting that in some way the Speaker has acted inappropriately or the chair has acted inappropriately and, indeed, come close to reflecting on the chair. I have given him the benefit of the doubt in the past. I have already said that, in respect of the comments made by the Special Minister of State, I will look at the transcript of the proceedings this afternoon and, if I believe there is some particular issue there which is of great concern, as has already been raised in the point of order, then I will deal with the matter at that point. I intend to leave the matter at that point. Do you have a further point of order?</PARA></TALK.START>

The journalist, who is a very capable lady and quite entitled to put her own conjecture into a story, has really drawn the bow a long way in this case. There are a number of statements in the article attributed to me with which I strongly disagree, but I will take up the time of the House with only two of them. On an earlier occasion, I referred to the act of allowing into Australia European sugar subsidised at 193 per cent as `criminally irresponsible'&mdash;that is how I used the phrase. I did not use it as it was attributed to me in this article. Secondly, the article quotes me as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Katter, the Member for Kennedy, said the Liberal Party was about to go through one of the most unstable periods in its history and a proposed merger of the two parties was not in the Nationals' interest.</PARA>
<PARA>I am, and have been, gravely worried about the weakness of the Queensland position in this House. Despite having sensible and capable members&mdash;in sharp contrast to those on the other side&mdash;and senators from Queensland representing the Liberal and National parties in this parliament, we have witnessed disastrous proposals affecting wool, sugar, bananas, dairy produce, tobacco, taxi drivers, milk vendors, news vendors, and post office licensees, to name but a few.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last two years, the Schools Council has focused on the study of the `compulsory' years of schooling&mdash;the preparatory, reception or kindergarten years to year 10. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Five to fifteen</EMPHASIS> is the council's formal advice on future directions for these vital years of schooling. In tabling the report, I shall take the opportunity to outline the government's view of the role which schools can play in educating young people for their lives as citizens of an Australia entering its second century of nationhood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the proposals in the report, the Commonwealth recognises that school education is primarily a state responsibility. But this does not preclude a national approach with the states and Commonwealth cooperating to pool their experience and resources. It makes no sense for young Australians to continue to be the victims of arbitrary lines on maps drawn by 19th century surveyors commissioned to set colonial boundaries. The interests of Australia's children do not change when they cross the Murray River or the Nullarbor Plain. There are issues in school education which cannot be undertaken by the states acting separately, issues which require the leadership of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 20 years, the Commonwealth has assumed responsibility for ensuring educational equity across the country and between different student groups. In other words, the Commonwealth's proper role is to see that access to quality schooling is assured for every Australian child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is why the Commonwealth is now committed to a national strategy for equity in schools. The national strategy will not only enable each state and territory to influence the setting of national priorities for the direction of funding to equity programs; it will also enable all school systems and the Commonwealth to set targets for raising the educational performance of particular groups of educationally disadvantaged students and for monitoring and reporting the outcomes for such groups in relation to those of the general student population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The realities of Australia's federal system mean that there will always be overlaps and confusion in the provision of educational services. But with goodwill between the states and Commonwealth they can be overcome. Indeed, they must be overcome if Australia is to build on the advantages of our excellent school systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's schools are well placed to meet the challenge of educating citizens for the 21st century. Certainly, I join with the Schools Council in encouraging all teachers to explore management philosophies aimed at the continuing incremental improvement of all aspects of their work. But it is important to emphasise that this change must be incremental, for Australia's teachers are already doing a good job. Indeed, the world at large recognises the quality of their work. The 1993 UNICEF report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The progress of nations </EMPHASIS>found that Australia&mdash;in company with Finland, Japan and Sweden&mdash;has the highest levels of primary school education in the world. Moreover, the doubling of retention rates during the last decade means that almost all children are remaining in education for at least 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet Australia's schools can be better. They can and will be better as our understanding of the intellectual disciplines of education improve. In fact, they must be better as there is no doubt that today's high standards will not be high enough for Australia in its second century of nationhood. This is why our industry is keen to see the general levels of school attainment rising and teachers becoming aware of the kinds of competencies and drive for life-long learning which will have to be demonstrated by their students when they become the work force of the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, not everyone supports the emphasis being placed in today's schools on the preparation of young people for the work force. The opposition, for example, does not. Its spokesman in this place refers to such vocational preparation as `instrumentalisation'. He accepts the notion of a `large, permanently unemployed work force', and says that young people `are unlikely to get jobs'. In fact, he demands that these young people `be educated for rational leisure'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These nostrums constitute nothing more than a litany of despair, a manifesto of defeat which this government absolutely rejects. The intellectual laziness that it represents has no place in the government's vision of schools education for the 21st century. We will not abandon the prospect of employment for our school graduates, and we will spare no effort in ensuring that their education equips them, as well as it possibly can, for all the dimensions of adult citizenship&mdash;including that of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is through the work of organisations such as the Schools Council that we can hope to reach these necessary goals. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Five to fifteen</EMPHASIS> does not cover all the elements of `compulsory' schooling which need to change to ensure that young people are comprehensively prepared for the 21st century. But the report does make some practical suggestions for improvement in a number of strategically important areas of school activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the report's emphasis on `explicit teaching' and its `outcomes based' approach to schooling. In a sense, the cooperative development within the Australian Education Council of the key competencies and the national curriculum profiles was a response to the demand for more explicit and transparent objectives being set for schooling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps this is why one of the criticisms which have been levelled at the competencies and profiles is that they are merely monitoring tools designed to enable closer scrutiny of the schooling sector. Few have acknowledged the potential value to students themselves of having the explicit means by which they might monitor their own educational performance. Young people should know what is expected of them, and they should be encouraged to notice when they have learned something to realise that what has been learned is as important as what has yet to be learned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Decisions as to whether or not the nationally cooperative trialling and further development of the curriculum statements and profiles will be re-established or not and, if they are, whether the key competencies will be taught and assessed within the context of the national curriculum framework will be taken at the forthcoming meeting of the Education Ministers Council in December. I hope that this meeting will see a resumption of the national collaborative process which has been so fruitful and resource effective in the gradual development of a national consensus on what Australian school children should know and be able to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Schools Council makes the point that several of its recommendations&mdash;such as the continuation of the effort to eliminate unnecessary interstate differences in schooling arrangements&mdash;assume that national collaboration between the schools systems and between them and the Commonwealth will be maintained. I remain optimistic that this will be the case, if only because commonsense dictates that the nation's various education authorities cannot deny the fact that Australia is one nation, not a collection of squabbling principalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly the Commonwealth acknowledges the concerns of groups as diverse as the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee that national collaboration not be abandoned. To answer their concerns the Commonwealth supports suggestions that the work being undertaken in various states and territories be reviewed at a national level by an independent and broadly representative body such as the Curriculum Corporation. The government also supports the Schools Council's view that it is desirable for schools to plan their curriculum and organise their teaching and learning in ways which ensure that the developmental needs of their students&mdash;in particular, those of young adolescents&mdash;are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Five to fifteen</EMPHASIS>, the Schools Council suggests that the traditional division of schooling into `primary' and `secondary' sectors can have the unintended consequences of muddying the focus on adolescents&mdash;who straddle both sides of that divide&mdash;and contributing to their transition problems. The council believes that additional effort needs to be made to ensure that there is more coherence, more continuity, between the curriculum at the different stages of schooling, and more integration across the different areas of the curriculum. The national curriculum profiles are an obvious means of achieving this kind of continuity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the `primary-secondary' divide remains, however, it is important that we ensure that these sectors are operating effectively. Following its election commitment, the government is undertaking a review of resource levels in government primary schools, with a particular focus on literacy. I am aware that my announcement of the review has been a matter for controversy amongst state administrations. However the Commonwealth's intention has been considerably strengthened by recent events in some states. The combined effects on public education of severe cost cutting and reductions in teacher numbers, of multiple school closures, of devolution, administrative downsizing and of the withdrawal of curriculum support services is as yet unknown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the substitution by state systems of Commonwealth funding for their own expenditure is a cause for concern. There is no net value to schools when the Commonwealth provides supplementary funding to ensure equity and to improve quality in any state whose own cost cutting appears simultaneously to be weakening the very foundations of public education. The review of resource levels in government primary schools will enable us to address public concerns that the most fundamental and important stage of schooling&mdash;that of primary schooling&mdash;is being protected and adequately resourced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drastic reductions in funding that are occurring in some states make it difficult to assess the merit of other changes that are occurring simultaneously. The Commonwealth supports the continuing trend to devolve as much decision making as possible to the school&mdash;as long as the supports which schools need to undertake their additional management responsibilities are not simultaneously withdrawn. I believe that the Schools Council's recommendation for a study into the differing models of devolution and decentralisation which are being applied to schooling both in this country and overseas has considerable merit, and I shall consult relevant organisations and systems on the best way to pursue this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Five to fifteen</EMPHASIS> on the teaching of literacy is consistent with the government's educational priorities and the strengthening of literacy teaching in schools&mdash;especially those which have concentrations of disadvantaged students&mdash;remains a major objective for the implementation of the Australian language and literacy policy. Under this policy, the government has funded a large number of research and development projects. They include research into the successful literacy and learning practices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students at schools and at home; everyday literacy practices in and out of school in low socioeconomic communities; and the teaching, monitoring, assessment and reporting of literacy learning in the early years. In  addition, the government has recently given the Australian Language and Literacy Council a reference on the education and professional development of teachers of literacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The status of our teachers and their professional development is at the heart of the Commonwealth's policies on school education. I therefore support the thrust of the recommendations in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Five to fifteen</EMPHASIS> on the initial education and professional development of teachers, and in particular I have already endorsed the Schools Council's suggestion that courses in primary school science be added to those which have been offered by the Commonwealth to enable teachers to renew their subject disciplines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Teaching is a profession and must be recognised as such. This is why the Commonwealth has provided seed funding for the establishment of a peak professional body for teachers, the Australian Teaching Council. The council will ultimately enable the profession to take collective responsibility for raising teaching standards throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsibility of the government to acknowledge and enhance the status of the teaching profession is also at the heart of the accord to advance the quality of teaching and learning which the Commonwealth concluded with the teaching profession earlier this week. The accord recognises the central role teachers play in schooling and sets out steps the signatories can play to further develop the skills and standing of the profession. It is a national initiative on an issue of national importance and demonstrates the Commonwealth's commitment to the entire spectrum of school education issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Schools Council for the work it has done during the past two years on the compulsory years of schooling, and on the preparation of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Five to fifteen</EMPHASIS>, the final report in the council's series on this stage of schooling. In this tabling statement, I have indicated some of the matters raised by the council which have the support of the government, and I shall be taking up with the council and others the details of specific recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among its current references, the council has been asked to look at the ways in which children acquire knowledge and develop attitudes toward career and post-compulsory education and training options, Australia's economic system and its economic future. I expect a particularly stimulating report on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to conclude with the government's vision of a school sector which adequately prepares young Australians for their lives as citizens and workers in the 21st century. It is one in which schools provide all their students with a high quality, broadly based education. It is one in which the business of the so-called `compulsory'  years of schooling is to ensure that students acquire the necessary foundation knowledge and skills to equip them to take advantage of `post-compulsory' vocational and academic pathways. The most important of these are literacy and numeracy. The vision is also one in which, to quote the Schools Council:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the school has the wider task of developing in its students a range of social, ethical, cultural, physical and aesthetic skills and understandings appropriate to their stage of development and maturation.</PARA>
<PARA>This may seem like a tall order. But I am confident that the increasing professionalism of teachers and principals, and the unremitting quest of parents for the best education for their children, can make the vision a reality. The Commonwealth will continue to support their endeavours. I present the report of the Schools Council. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important when looking at the matters raised in the report to consider some of the issues surrounding education and schooling in Australia at present. There have in fact been a series of indications about the standards and performance of Australian students over the past decade to which this report directs itself in part. For example, in 1983-84 the International Association for Evaluation of Education Achievement conducted a study comparing the performance of students around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This study, which, although 10 years old, is the most recent of its kind, revealed that the level of achievement of Australian 14-year-olds was far below that of students in Japan and significantly below that of students in a number of European countries, including some in eastern Europe. In 1988 the Australian Council for Educational Research found that only 77 per cent of year 9 students achieved the minimum reading competency required in adult society. The study also found that standards in spelling and certain mathematical skills had declined since 1980. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent report on literacy by a parliamentary committee documented the fact that up to 25 per cent of children leaving primary school were unable to read or write adequately. We also had an indication from the Australian Council for Adult Literacy in 1990 that an estimated one million Australian adults cannot read or write adequately. These are national concerns in relation to education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague the honourable member for Goldstein points out, that is after 10 years of this government. On a recent occasion another speaker spoke about what he termed cultural literacy in Australia. He asked the question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And how do Australian students compare when given similar questions about Australian heritage?</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A survey conducted among 200 Melbourne undergraduates for Australia Week in February this year produced some alarming results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only a fifth of our University students could identify Patrick White as the author of the Australian novel Voss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When asked to name just three famous Australian painters, from the great wealth of artistic talent this country has produced, only one in four was able to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One quarter of students did not know that the Murray-Darling was the largest river system in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only eight percent of students could name an internationally acclaimed scientist&mdash;with students offering names such as, Barry Jones, Dick Smith and Professor Julius Sumner Miller instead of Florey, Burnet and Hargrave.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To be fair, as the first three owe their fame at least in part to television, and the second three are depicted on our currency, we can say that in the choice between the money or the box, the box won.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under any circumstances these figures are unacceptable, but for a nation that has had 100 years of compulsory schooling they are alarming.</PARA>
<PARA>The speaker on that occasion was the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, the Hon. Bob Carr, and I think it points out, without drawing party political matters into this debate, that there is a concern across the spectrum for the standard of education in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this latest report the government has published a collection of pious hopes and good intentions but the question remains: how much substance is there? For example, we are told that the teaching of science should be upgraded, yet the report also gives partial support to national curriculum profiles which, on all the evidence that has been provided by the scientific community in this country, would certainly lead to the demoralisation of science teaching. The report also recommends training teachers to deal with literacy problems, and in that regard these recommendations have come none too soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot let pass some remarks which the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) made in his tabling statement in relation to the question of unemployment. He referred to remarks that I made in May about the prospect of there being a large, permanently unemployed work force in this country. I said that many young people&mdash;and the minister quoted me accurately&mdash;are unlikely to get jobs. I also mentioned the fact that education must take this into account.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HK5">Mr ANDREWS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;but one of his colleagues, whom I will identify in a moment, in speaking on this issue, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is some downward movement in our unemployment rate, no matter how slow, no matter how high the absolute level, we can too easily be lulled into an uncritical belief that everything will come good eventually.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's just a matter of time. After all we've been through recessions before and unemployment has always fallen back to its previous low level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But that isn't true.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It hasn't.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This country, along with many others, has experienced a `ratchet' effect in economic cycles over the last twenty years. Since the early 1970s the unemployment rate has moved upward in a series of large steps.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployment shoots up at the start of an economic downturn. Long-term unemployment shoots up a year later when the unemployed start crossing the definitional threshold of twelve months out of work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then, with economic recovery, starts a long, slow process of reducing the number of people out of work. But the numbers do not fall to the level which existed before the downturn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is especially the case for the long term unemployed who are the last to benefit from employment growth. The long term unemployed are hurt most by recession and helped least by recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the next downturn starts, the starting pool of unemployed is larger, and the whole process ratchets up another step.</PARA>
<PARA>The speaker on that occasion was none other than the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), a colleague of the minister at the table, who was admitting to the Australian people for the first time what others on this side of the House, including me, have been saying and what every Australian knows: that the prospect of long-term unemployment is something we will have to live with and work our way out of. We cannot simply snap our fingers and have jobs somehow materialise overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his statement at the press club, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training went on to say that he was not talking about the prospect of bringing unemployment down to under two per cent, or six per cent or even under 10 per cent&mdash;he was not going to put a figure on it&mdash;but that his proposals were something much less modest. If the minister at the table wishes to make what seem to me to be fairly petty debating points, he should at least get his story right with his senior minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to take up the time of the House by debating all the matters raised in this report but I would like to mention the continuing fascination of some in education and in government, including the Schools Council, with the concept of competencies. The question is not so much whether we have this grand framework of competencies, but whether we have a school student population, and later a work force, which is competent. Nonetheless, as has been pointed out, there is a fixation in this country with some grand framework. Richard Sweet from the Dusseldorp forum said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In continental Europe a long tradition of scholarly engagement in the study of learning at work has led to a strong concern for embedding process in the way in which vocational education policy and practice are developed.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say something about the obsession with structures. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Here&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we place little emphasis on process, but demonstrate almost an obsession with structures. The major focus of European interest in key qualifications, core competencies and the like is how these should be developed, not put into frameworks. There is far greater concern with how to ensure that apprentices and vocational education students actually learn in specific practical situations to plan, cooperate and solve problems than with putting these competencies into generalised multi-level frameworks that pose almost insurmountable problems in assessment.</PARA>
<PARA>Through his remarks on this report, the minister appears to be propagating the notion that we should have this centralised, top-down, bureaucratic structure in which a framework of competency is established for the entire nation and from which nobody in any part of the country can ever divert. If that is so, I would ask him how we will get the degree of flexibility in education and training in the secondary school levels, let alone in the vocational levels, that will lead to a skilled work force. The reality is that if we have that inflexibility, we will not achieve what we set out to achieve in providing adequate education and training in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other comments in this report to which I would like to refer. For example, the Schools Council recommends that there be some examination of the year 10 certificate in relation to a general statement about what schools have achieved. I note with some interest that earlier this year the board of studies of the minister for education in New South Wales, Virginia Chadwick, released a discussion paper on the future role of the school certificate which addressed the problem of reporting on skills at the year 10 level. Maybe that is an example which the Schools Council could look at in furthering this particular objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, there were also some comments by the Schools Council in relation to assessment. In the debate about competencies, the national curriculum and assessment in Australia it seems that the aspect of that debate which has dropped out of consideration has tended to be assessment. If one goes to industry, one will hear the Business Council and similar groups say that they want some form of assessment whereby they can tell whether students have achieved levels of competence, skill, knowledge and learning so that they can guarantee, or say with some degree of accuracy, that when they take on students they will achieve a certain standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could ask parents around this country what they want for their children. As the parent of primary school age children, I would answer this question myself. At least at that primary school level, I want to know that my children will leave school able to read fluently and able to write in a way which they understand and which someone else reading that writing can understand. I want to know that they have a knowledge of basic mathematical and numeracy concepts, such as addition, multiplication, the use of fractions and the like, and that they have some understanding of the history of Australia and the place in which they live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not seem too modest an expectation to have of primary level schooling in Australia, let alone secondary level schooling. Yet when we look at the various studies which I quoted at the outset and a whole series of other studies in this country relating to this issue, we find that, sadly, that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final comment is in relation to the minister's remarks about teaching and the teaching accord. There is no doubt in my mind that, in order to continue to raise the level of expertise and skills and therefore the level of education in Australia, one must continue to work at giving every opportunity to teachers to raise their skills and competence. I do query, however, whether the accord&mdash;`accord' being a notion taken from industrial relations&mdash;is actually about achieving those educational outcomes or whether it is in fact something which has more to do with industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the final chapter of Paul Kelly's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The End of Certainty</EMPHASIS>, which many members of this House may have read&mdash;they may have read the index, at least, to see whether they cracked a mention. Kelly states that the five principles of the Australian settlement&mdash;of which he names the White Australia Policy, state paternalism and wage arbitration&mdash;were overtaken by the events of the 1980s and the early 1990s and that the future structure upon which society in Australia is to be judged will be according to principles different from those of the so-called Australian settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting fact in relation to education is that it seems to me that some of these aspects of the top-down bureaucratic structure still reflect state paternalism and not the degree of flexibility that we require. Some aspects of the language of the teaching accord&mdash;the minister can convince me otherwise&mdash;seem to be more about wage arbitration than education. There is a nice irony. If Kelly were correct in terms of those principles having been bypassed, the nice irony is that they may well still be part of the ruling notions which determine the future of education. As I said at the outset, I have had only a short time to look at this report. There are obviously other things which deserve careful consideration. I, along with the minister, commend the report to other members of this place. </PARA>

As a signatory to the Florence agreement, Australia cannot impose tariffs or other charges on the importation of books of scientific, cultural or educational value. Bounty is paid on the local production of such books in order to assist the Australian printing industry to compete with overseas book printers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed in this bill are the government's response to the Industry Commission's recommendations contained in its report No. 27 of 15 October 1992 on book production. In that report the Industry Commission commented that productivity improvements in book production appears to have more than offset the effects of the gradual reduction of assistance and that continued reduction of the bounty rate and other assistance is likely to maintain pressure to improve efficiency. The commission supported the continuation of the orderly reduction in assistance within the general program of tariff reductions announced by the government in March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to bounty assistance, the commission's main recommendations were, first, that rates be reduced in four steps from the current 13.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent by 1997; secondly, that the present $500 minimum claim amount be replaced by a minimum publisher's production cost per production run of $3,700 per title with effect from 1 January 1994; and, thirdly, that the present arrangements, whereby either the publisher or a printer may claim bounty, remain unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has accepted all the commission's recommendations and this bill implements those recommendations in relation to bounty assistance by extending the life of the bounty to 31 December 1997 and annually phasing down bounty rates from the current 13.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent by January 1997. The bill also proposes to extend bounty eligibility to directories other than Australian telephone directories and timetables on the condition that they contain less than 30 per cent advertising and to specifically exclude company prospectuses from bounty eligibility as they are in a similar class of publications to annual reports and shareholders reports which are already excluded as they are unlikely to be printed offshore because of time restraints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now address the amendments proposed to the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984. The computer bounty is an important element of the government's policy for the computer industry, which for bounty purposes includes manufacturers of modems, multiplexers, microprocessors, computer subassemblies, electronic microcircuits and, since July 1991, printed circuit boards. The decision in 1990 to continue the computer bounty scheme, which resulted in the extension of the scheme until 31 December 1995, reflects a commitment by this government, and indeed this parliament, to encouraging increased development and use of computer equipment and microprocessor technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992-93, the computer bounty program provided about $75 million of direct assistance to 927 registered manufacturing premises. The program is expected to provide $78 million to industry in 1993-94 and slightly lower levels in forward years with the adoption of the legislative changes proposed in this bill. On current trends, without either legislative or administrative changes, the budget outlays for this program are expected to be in the order of $88 million in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in particular introduce a definition of `research and development' to clarify and limit the eligible expenditure which might be included under this phrase. This proposed definition, together with the proposed amendment to the method of calculating value added by a manufacturer in section 6 of the act, expressly requires that, in order for expenditure on research and development to qualify for inclusion in a manufacturer's bountiable factory costs, the research and development must be likely to result in the manufacture of bountiable equipment within the bounty period; that is, by 31 December 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other substantive amendments to the Bounty (Computers) Act contained in this bill which are explained in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. One is designed to strengthen the ability under the act to substantiate claims&mdash;clause 10 of the bill&mdash;by requiring bounty recipients to keep records and accounts which are relevant to claims for several years, in line with provisions in other bounty acts. The other introduces an administrative reform to allow interstate manufacturing operations to lodge consolidated claims across state and territory borders, thereby reducing administrative effort and costs for some claimants. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)That a message be sent to the Senate requesting the reconsideration by the Senate of the resolution in respect of the modification made by the House in place of the Senate resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>This matter arises from a request to us from the Senate that we appoint an additional senator to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The Senate asked specifically that the number of senators to be nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate rise from one to two. That possibly had something to do with the fact that, under the previous set of arrangements, the number of Liberal Party senators in the membership of the committee potentially was outweighed by the collection of minority parties. The Liberal Party wished to have a position of equality with them. We are happy about that. It is a fair enough point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does, however, create a difficult situation because it puts the government in a minority on the committee if the decision is taken that way. Hence, we have moved for an additional member from the House of Representatives to be appointed. I have talked with the ranking Liberal Party member on the committee. The point was made to me that, provided the government was prepared to exercise the same principle down the line, after the opposition had the time to talk this through in its party room arrangements, it might be prepared to make some further variations. I said to that honourable member, behind the Speaker's chair, that we would be prepared to do that. He suggested to me that, on that basis, he would be happy enough for this motion to proceed. As far as the government is concerned, it is not terribly fussed about the level of representation, or even necessarily the chamber, provided the tradition whereby the government is not outnumbered on one of these committees is sustained. In order to achieve that objective, we have moved the motion in the form in which it appears. </PARA>

As a result, we have one member of the House, one member of the National Party, and only one senator.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was putting before the debate was interrupted, it now appears that four Australian women have died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease as a result of treatment with the fertility drug HPG, manufactured by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The program was suspended in 1985 but the attitude towards informing those women at risk was complacent, to say the least. By the end of June 1992, only some 350 of the 1,500 women in Australia at risk had been notified. As the husband of one of the deceased pointed out to me recently, the Commonwealth's response to this tragedy has been directly connected to the amount of publicity that has been generated. Only publicity has got the Commonwealth moving in relation to this problem. It began to get a spur on between December 1992 and August 1993 when it contacted 513 women&mdash;12 months after I had first raised the matter in the parliament. It was a full seven years after the connection between the drug and the fatal disease had become known and the program had been suspended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it was only after this process of notification was stepped up that the Commonwealth became aware that two women had died and that they had not been accurately diagnosed as being sufferers of CJD. Even though they had died some years before, it was not until the process of notification was taken up that the Commonwealth became aware that they had been fatalities of this system. As a result&mdash;as may be expected&mdash;legal proceedings have been taken against CSL. The families of three of the women who have died have taken proceedings in the Supreme Court of Victoria. I understand that there are 19 writs outstanding, the balance of them being from those who have been treated for but have not suffered the tragic CJ disease; they are suing in relation to shock and other claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I was contacted in relation to this matter by Noel Halford, the husband of the second Australian woman to die of this disease, and through my involvement in this matter, I have come to know Ted Allender, the husband of the first Australian woman to have died. Both of these men have been through great suffering and tragedy. Each of them now has legal proceedings on foot. It is not a question of seeking personal enrichment. They have legitimate claims on behalf of their children, who have lost a mother. They have also lost an income earner. They will have to be responsible for the upbringing of their children. Those children will be brought up without a mother that they would otherwise have been entitled to expect to have to look after them, and to earn an income. They are, as a matter of justice on behalf of their families, bringing those proceedings in the Supreme Court of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have also done an enormous amount to get the facts concerning this matter out to the public. Ted Allender has provided a veritable computer base of information in relation to this disease and has been leading the debate on it. It is the efforts of people such as Ted Allender, Noel Halford, certain academics&mdash;Dr Dumble and Dr Klein&mdash;and me, that have provided a great deal of the information on this matter. For quite a long time I found that Australian women were ringing me to get information about their medical risk status because the Commonwealth's system of notification was so poorly organised in the initial stages, and the Commonwealth was so reticent about making sure that the information actually got to the women concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe for a moment that the Commonwealth has to stand behind and compensate people for every tragedy that occurs. Tragedies occur in life that nobody is responsible for. But, in relation to these cases, I make the following points: this was a drug which was manufactured by a Commonwealth agency, administered under a Commonwealth health program, and supervised by the Human Pituitary Advisory Committee; it was a contaminated drug that has killed four Australian women who otherwise would be alive and healthy today. I ask honourable members</PARA>
<PARA>to draw their own conclusions as to where the justice in this situation lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> debacle, for example, the Commonwealth spent a lot of time and money defending those claims in court. In the end it was forced to compensate the victims. In relation to this matter, the Commonwealth can either spend its money on lawyers or on the victims. It will not necessarily be any cheaper to spend the money on the lawyers; the Commonwealth will be paying whichever way it goes. As a matter of justice, it would be far more just and far more helpful to those who have suffered if the Commonwealth said that on this occasion its beneficence will be directed towards the victims, the families that have suffered the death and loss of a loved one, rather than the legal profession defending the claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken up this matter with the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson). He wrote to me recently on the matter, telling me that, in relation to the proposed sale of CSL, the prospectus ought to refer explicitly to indemnity arrangements concerning the production of human pituitary hormones. He said that the Commonwealth currently indemnifies CSL against claims for damages arising from the use of products derived from human pituitary hormones. He stated that this indemnity will continue after the public float of the company and be reflected in an agreement between CSL and the Commonwealth. He said that he was advised that the sales prospectus, which is currently being drafted, will include specific references to this indemnity. The minister is saying that the Commonwealth will stand behind these claims. We would not want a situation where CSL was privatised and there was a prospect that these claims would be left defeated or barren in any judgment that might be awarded&mdash;if it comes to a judgment. The Commonwealth should be picking up the liability in this situation of privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I warmly commend the minister for taking that stand. I look forward to making sure that those arrangements are reflected in legal indemnity documents. They should be made clear, public and open before the privatisation goes ahead so that no-one is in any doubt about the situation. One may have expected CSL to be insured against incidents like this. I do not know what its insurance policy was, but I am concerned to ensure that, at the end of the day, those claims will not be defeated as a result of the privatisation. Those arrangements need to be put in place for the sake of justice and the concern of those 1,500 women who are at risk as a result of this terrible tragedy. </PARA>

My colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) will speak on the actual sale arrangements and other such matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I begin firstly by saying that, while we have already effectively embraced the spirit of the comments made by the opposition in terms of its amendment, we do not see any reason for this amendment. We think that it could actually be misunderstood by some people. So rather than accepting the wording of this amendment we will reject that proposal and instead we will explain the situation as far as we can in relation to the matters raised by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) who moved the amendment. I want also to make some comments in relation to the matter raised by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) on the dreaded CJD and some of the issues that he has raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, on the general amendment, we do not think it is necessary and we consider that under the provisions contained in the Corporations Law the government is required to assess all costs and liabilities, existing and potential, of the CSL. This includes the extent of any product liabilities which have already been addressed by the task force on asset sales as part of the due diligence process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth and the CSL are currently negotiating the terms of the indemnities to be provided by the Commonwealth post-sale. Those negotiations will focus on the indemnity sought by the company covering blood products, pertussis and products derived from human pituitary hormones. The government has the issue of contingent liabilities well in hand and it therefore regards this aspect of the amendment as unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the reference in the amendment to an employee share scheme, the CSL board has already taken an in-principle decision, after recommendations from a number of members, including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and me, to establish such a scheme of employee shares, and it is currently considering the nature and form of that scheme. I understand that a consultant has been appointed to work out the actual processes in relation to such a scheme. Therefore, we already have that matter in hand and we consider that the terms of the amendment are therefore unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now go into more detail with respect to the issue of the indemnity concerning the products. Before I do that, it might be useful for me to explain what the government is doing in relation to CJD in broad terms and to fit into that what we intend to do with respect to the indemnity for the CSL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 11 May 1993 the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, announced an independent inquiry into the use of pituitary derived hormones in Australia and the rare disorder of CJD. This followed confirmation that four Australian women who were treated with human pituitary hormone while seeking treatment for infertility have since died from the disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry will be headed by Associate Professor Margaret Allars, who will be assisted by experts from the relevant scientific and medical areas and will have the full support of Commonwealth agencies. State governments are being asked to assist by ensuring access to relevant records held by public hospitals. The government believes that the people who were treated while on the program and who are at risk of contracting this disease have a right to know how and on what basis the decisions to start and continue the use of the product were taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also vital that there be an examination of related issues to see if procedures in place today are adequate in the light of this unfortunate experience. The inquiry will make recommendations on a number of areas, including further action which might be taken to identify and counsel people who used the treatment, and priorities for research into matters relating to CJD and its transmission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1967 and 1985, approximately 2,100 Australians were supplied with cadaver derived hormones as treatment for infertility and short stature. The program was stopped in 1985 after reports from overseas of deaths from CJD of people who had received similar hormones. The department of health has contacted at least 1,300 of the 2,100 people on the program and is continuing efforts to trace the remainder. A task force has been established within the department to concentrate efforts on tracing participants and providing advice and support. Comprehensive national counselling services are now available for people treated with human pituitary hormones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 October 1993, Marriage Guidance Australia will offer special counselling and support services for people who were treated with these products and who could now be at risk of contracting CJD. Marriage Guidance Australia will provide a professional, confidential service with qualified counsellors available in every state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest concerns expressed by people treated under the program is that they have not had the level of support and counselling services that they needed. As a result, there is wide support for community based rather than hospital based counselling services. The free service will help product recipients and their families with problems occurring as a result of uncertainty and anxiety, will offer psychological support and, if necessary, will refer people for further medical advice. That is the situation in relation to the question of the overall actions by the government in relation to this dreaded disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question asked was about the actual arrangements with respect to indemnity. To clarify the position, I think the best thing I can do is to place on the record the contents of a letter from Mr Roche, the Deputy Secretary to the department, to Dr McNamee, the Managing Director of CSL. In the letter, Mr Roche sets out quite clearly what the situation is going to be with respect to indemnity, and I think it is important that we place this on the record. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 30 August 1993 requesting that, in the context of the public float of the Company, the Commonwealth indemnify CSL Limited against claims arising from the use of a number of products manufactured and supplied by the Company; namely plasma products, blood bank diagnostic reagents, human pituitary gland-derived hormone products and pertussis vaccine products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Officials from the Task Force on Asset Sales (TFAS), the Australian Government Solicitor's Office (AGS) and this Department have examined your request and generally support the provision by the Commonwealth of a range of Product indemnities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reaching our position, we took the view that the Commonwealth should not indemnify a privatised CSL for claims relating to the use of the Products where CSL is able or has been able to obtain product liability insurance. We also considered that no indemnity should be provided where the Company has made or will make commercial decisions independent of Government to enter arrangements for the manufacture and supply of any of the Products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, I would expect that, in the case of foreign tolling of plasma, CSL will either seek indemnities from the countries concerned or reflect in its pricing policies the risks associated with the use of plasma products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to the above restrictions, the provision of Product indemnities to a privatised CSL has been limited to cases where:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Commonwealth has requested or permitted CSL over the years, and before the listing of the Company on the Stock Exchange, to manufacture Products the use of which could attract claims for damages;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Product indemnities were provided by the Commonwealth to a Commonwealth-owned CSL; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Commonwealth requests CSL to manufacture and supply post-sale, any of the Products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within this framework and for Products manufactured prior to the listing of the Company on the Australian Stock Exchange, and, in some cases, before the execution of the proposed plasma fractionation and diagnostic products agreements, we will recommend to the Minister that the Commonwealth provides an indemnity for any loss suffered by CSL arising from certain claims brought against the Company by any person as a result of the use of the following products:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)human pituitary growth hormones and human pituitary gonadotrophin (follicle stimulating hormone);</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)plasma products supplied to New Zealand and Papua New Guinea (PNG), where the products are derived from plasma donated by individuals and collected in New Zealand and PNG and the claims are AIDS-related;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)plasma products derived from plasma donated by individuals and collected in Australia, where the claims are AIDS-related or arise from hepatitis;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)diagnostic products derived from blood donated by individuals and collected in Australia, where the claims are AIDS-related; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)pertussis vaccine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the post-sale context, where the Commonwealth has requested CSL to undertake the manufacture of any of the Products for and on behalf of the Commonwealth, the related indemnity will be incorporated in an agreement between the parties. I note that the current draft of the proposed plasma fractionation agreement includes an indemnity clause for AIDS-related and hepatitis claims from users of plasma products sourced from plasma collected from individuals in Australia. I would expect that the proposed diagnostic reagent products agreement will contain a similar clause but only covering AIDS-related claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have noted your request for an indemnity for claims relating to asbestos exposure by present and former employees, and can confirm your understanding that the Commonwealth is not prepared to indemnify CSL for claims made by present Company employees relating to asbestos exposure. The question of whether an indemnity will be provided by the Commonwealth to former employees for asbestos related claims is still under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that the Commonwealth will further consider that matter one way or another, but that is a separate question to the issue we are discussing at the moment. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also note that your request for an indemnity for CSL directors in respect of the float process is being considered by the TFAS (in conjunction with the AGS) which will convey the Commonwealth's position to you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust our position on product indemnities is acceptable to you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sending a copy of this letter to Ross Smith of the Task Force.</PARA>
<PARA>In that letter, Mr Roche has broadly outlined the general approach of the government to this very complicated matter. In general, the concerns raised by the opposition have already been taken into account through the commitments made by the department and recommended to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the government is concerned, obviously protection needs to be afforded for specific indemnities. However, the opposition's motion tends to suggest a much broader sweeping definition than the one suggested by the government. For example, the government can be responsible only for those situations in which it has been responsible for CSL up to the point of sale. It can only be responsible for those situations in which CSL has made determinations which, in a sense, meet its responsibilities to the government. The government cannot be responsible for commercial decisions made by CSL, especially post-sale, unless those decisions are consistent with the Commonwealth having specifically requested CSL to produce a particular product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, given all of those factors, the concerns the opposition tried to raise in its amendments have been met by the comments I have made here today. Some of the other issues raised by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Bradfield, will be dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate CSL for the work it has done over the years for the Australian people. I am very pleased that CSL is setting up its new plant in my electorate at Broadmeadows. By the way, that happened before I gained responsibility for this area; nevertheless, I am very pleased that it is happening. The plant is one of the most modern in the world for these matters. This company, through its technology and development, shows what Australians are capable of in this area. It will be able to compete internationally and to retain a very significant section of the Australian market. I am sure that we will all be proud of its work in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Managing Director of CSL, Dr McNamee, particularly, needs to be congratulated for his efforts. CSL as a company has just handed down another very large profit, which shows not only that it has been working to deliver an excellent system to the Australian people but also that it is a very successful commercial operation. As the other parliamentary secretary will explain, the sale will proceed very satisfactorily and we can be certain that, into the future, Australia will have a significant supply of vaccine and plasma products from CSL. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I close the debate on the CSL Sale Bill by thanking those honourable members who have been involved in the debate. I recently came back into this debate, having been involved previously as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health in the earlier stages of the preparation for sale of CSL Ltd, which was formerly the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. More recently, I introduced the bill on behalf of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) has explained a number of the issues dealing with any enduring liabilities that the Commonwealth might hold over products manufactured by CSL in the past or in the future where it cannot be insured. I will canvass some of the sale conditions because one honourable member asked in the debate why there were certain restrictions on the condition of sale. In deference to that honourable member, I should explain why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be kept in mind that in this bill the government is preparing CSL, which essentially is a vaccine and blood plasma products manufacturer, for sale from the Commonwealth's holdings. It has been the case for a very long time that, whilst the Commonwealth probably felt comfortable that it had this in-house producer, CSL itself was keen, prepared, willing and able to go out and compete with the best in the rest of the world, but one of the things holding it back was that it had to come to the Commonwealth for capital, and capital is at a premium in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL management, and to some extent the workers after some discussion, felt that it would be in the best interests of CSL as a producer, that it could do a better job as a manufacturer and a producer of these products, if it were to float free and be then free to draw on capital markets for its own purposes and its own growth. So we are preparing for this float, which should take place in the first quarter of 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important decisions we made at a very early stage, though, was that CSL should remain an Australian company and an independent company. We did not want it to be immediately gobbled up by a foreign chemical manufacturing company, but wanted it to remain Australian and be given a good chance, at least in the first instance, and hopefully from then on in, to remain Australian and independent. We want it to maintain those links with the Australian scientific community and the international producers at a scientific and production level so that it can take its place as one of the world's great producers of chemical products. I think we have successfully introduced a bill which will maintain the CSL, during and after its float, as an Australian and independent organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to review some of the critical mechanisms by which we will achieve this. The first mechanism, which relates to the foreign control and influence of CSL after the sale, is that there will be a requirement that CSL's articles of association include provisions which limit the voting rights of significant foreign shareholders to the appointment, replacement and removal of company directors. Those foreign shareholders with holdings greater than five per cent will be able to exercise their votes only in relation to one-third of the directors. Further, we will require that CSL's head office and principal fractionation activities be located in Australia, that CSL remain incorporated in Australia, and that CSL's chairman and two-thirds of the board be Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the point of sale, we also have some further rules. Those arrangements will be complemented by an allocation of shares in CSL at the point of sale. Those rules are that there will be a limit of five per cent on all individual shareholdings, domestic or foreign, an aggregate limit of 15 to 20 per cent on foreign shareholdings, and a preference for individuals and institutions over corporate shareholders. The third leg of those series of controls is that post-sale restrictions on foreign ownership of shares in CSL will be regulated through the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975. That satisfies a very firm decision of the government, which is a decision not so much to dispose of an asset but a decision which is a part of industry policy. The government had quite a good and strong debate on this issue: we see CSL as an Australian producer not simply being sold out of the Commonwealth's hands into private hands but enduring as an Australian manufacturer of vaccines and blood plasma products. Of course, it has some world-class blood fractionation facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the bill will easily achieve the aims we set it. I appreciate the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), which talks about the notion of contingent liability&mdash;that has been addressed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health&mdash;and that the board of management of CSL Ltd encourage broad employee shareholding in CSL. That, as we understand it, has been a subject of debate between the board and the workers of CSL. I think we have incorporated as well as we can both of the sentiments expressed by the opposition, and I appreciate the fact that it has raised those sentiments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank those people involved through the assets sales task force attached to the Minister for Finance and those officers from the department of health who have also been engaged in this but I particularly want to thank CSL management and its work force, which have had to work through all of the work conditions&mdash;conditions which may or may not change as a consequence of this sale out of the Commonwealth's hands. We are confident, as is the work force itself, that the conditions workers have built up whilst CSL has been in the hands of the Commonwealth will be maintained. In fact, those negotiations have already taken place and, as far as I understand it, have been perfectly reasonably settled. I wish the Chief Executive Officer&mdash;Dr McNamee&mdash;his board and all the workers all the best in a company that will be for a long time to come a very significant player and a new Australian company. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Amendment Bill amends the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Act 1988. Currently the act provides for appropriation to the Civil Aviation Authority of duty on aviation gasoline. The purpose of the amendment is to enable duty on aviation turbine fuel to be appropriated to the CAA as part of the aviation safety regulation cost recovery regime. Honourable members will remember that in the 1992 budget it was announced the cost of aviation safety standard setting and surveillance would be jointly met by the government and the aviation industry. The government would meet 50 per cent of the costs up to a limit of $22.8 million in real terms. The government proposes to phase in cost recovery of the industry's portion of these costs over the two years, beginning with the 1993-94 financial year. Cost recovery arrangements for 1993-94 involve a slight increase in duty on both aviation gasoline and aviation turbine fuel. Because fuel used by Australian airlines on international services is exempt from duty, the CAA will introduce a fee for safety regulation to these international operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry's contribution to aviation and safety standards setting and surveillance for this financial year will reduce government outlays by $4.5 million. Users of aviation gasoline recently benefited, too, from a 3c per litre reduction in duty, and the CAA is currently exploring the prospect for a further reduction following the introduction of new airspace management arrangements. I must say that the proposed method of cost recovery with this particular situation is reasonably straightforward. But it is true that the industry would have preferred the government to adhere to the recommendations of the Bosch report that these costs not be recoverable. In 1985, under then minister Morris, the government and the aviation industry accepted the Bosch recommendations as a package, notwithstanding some industry misgivings at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It frankly remains to be seen what the future holds in aviation cost recovery. There is no doubt that the government, if it is to meet its objectives, will need to increase its recovery from the industry to meet future cost recovery targets. The industry, particularly the airlines, are concerned that the necessary imposts being imposed have regard to the various sector contributions to the need of the safety regulations and standards function. I suppose this is understandable because the major airlines do not use many of the facilities that are provided, whereas general aviation, which could be high users of these particular facilities, would find it very difficult under the present circumstances to meet some of those costs. It will be a difficult outcome to achieve given, by its very nature, that the regulation function needs to be deployed, regardless of the sector funding of its costs, if the public interest is to be served. It is true that these matters are still to be subjected to discussion with the CAA, but the difficulties are such that the consideration of funding the entirety of the safety regulations and standards function on behalf of the community may well be appropriate. I say quite seriously that the opposition parties will certainly be monitoring the way the government proceeds with this particular matter. There is no doubt that there is a campaign that has built up into almost a frenzy amongst the general aviation operators of Australia as a result of the prospect of the safety levy being put on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">General aviation in Australia has had a very difficult few years. Over the last few years we have seen a decline of 14 and 16 per cent per annum in general aviation activities. This has been brought about by a number of factors, not the least being the economic situation, the rural downturn and the drought. While many operators have already left the industry, the real scare is that more will go if the safety regulation charges are implemented by the government to cover these costs in their entirety. It is a very real challenge to the government, and one that we will be monitoring very closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that aviation safety, and the regulation of safety, is a most important matter. It is true that in Australia we have had the highest safety standards in the world. We certainly have had one of the finest aviation safety records. It is therefore of some concern when we see the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> carrying the headline `Fatal flight after lapse by officials'. Whilst as yet we have not seen the full report into the crash of an aircraft at Young, the interim report indicates that this is a most serious situation. According to that report, the initial investigation by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation found that the aircraft involved had flown with a `significantly reduced' level of safety&mdash;a level that was below the minimum equipment list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) made a statement a couple of weeks ago to an estimates committee that any aircraft that did not comply with the minimum equipment list is just `not supposed to fly'. I agree with that statement completely. Yet we find that this particular unfortunate aircraft had an unserviceable auto-pilot which was permitted to be used for something like 10 days. Admittedly, it was in accordance with the minimum equipment list, but permission was given to fly that aircraft twice, it would appear, when it did not have all its functions operating properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it is probably not completely proper to comment on what the interim findings might be, and we should really wait for the final CAA review, I think this particular case brings home the importance of monitoring aviation safety standards in Australia. Since this report appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> this morning it has been interesting to hear some of the press commentators already talking about the situation of deregulation and what that may or may not have done in the case of this particular incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no problems with deregulation of the airline industry at all. In fact, deregulation does not mean, and it should not mean, the lowering of safety standards. I hope we find that this was an isolated incident rather than one of laxity by the department in allowing some of those standards to slip. I am sure that the latter was not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in a deregulated industry safety standards are set and all operators are required to maintain them. If the operators involved go below those particular safety standards, of course they must take the consequences. Therefore, I would hope that we would not be going into a frenzy regarding the reintroduction of a fully regulated airline industry when there are obviously so many savings that can be made in a deregulated environment. Perhaps I should not say any more than that until such time as the full report from the Civil Aviation Authority is released regarding this particular incident in Young. But it certainly does bring home the need for constant vigilance of our aviation safety programs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this respect, this bill is the beginning of a whole new regime. It is a whole new way of funding aviation safety, and it is one that we should be considering very carefully until we get the final program in place; firstly because of the cost that would be applied not only to the major airline operators, but to the general aviation industry; and secondly, how we can get a balance for a user pays principle on the monitoring of safety, vis-a-vis the cost to the general aviation sector which provides such an important role in the development of Australia and in the remote areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition, therefore, will be watching the development of this program very closely and with very great interest. We hope that we will have an opportunity to be able to work out what will be fair and equitable, but still maintain the incredibly high safety standards that Australia has enjoyed over the past decades. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in support of the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Amendment Bill. I advise the House that I am somewhat flying blind as I left my glasses in my office. I want to join the shadow minister for transport and communications, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), in some of his comments. I guess it is always dangerous for a backbench member to praise a shadow minister, but I know that he takes a great deal of interest in his portfolio area. On most occasions people on both sides of the House find it difficult to disagree with him. I certainly am in such a situation today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bill is to appropriate certain excise revenues to the Civil Aviation Authority. This is my first opportunity to say in this House how delighted I was that General Peter Gration was appointed chairman of the authority. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence it was my great pleasure to have some deal of contact with Peter and I am sure that he will do an outstanding job. I am sure that he will earn the respect, admiration and thanks of those in the aviation industry, in the same way as he did in the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow minister has pointed out, we should be very proud of our safety record in Australia. The price of safety is eternal vigilance and avoiding complacency. Whilst both sides of the House have supported this approach of phased in full cost recovery, we want to avoid the situation that results in any lessening of standards. I am confident that it will not. I regret that I cannot comment on the accident that has been referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation increases the cost of aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene by 0.264c per litre. For those who do not know, gasoline is utilised by piston-powered aircraft and aviation kerosene is utilised by turbine-powered aircraft. The revenue will accrue from 1 September 1993. It is expected that in 1994-95 we will move from a situation of the government and the industry sharing the cost of safety regulations to a position where the industry will be fully funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose my being in the electorate of Chifley puts me in an ironic situation when talking about aviation, aeroplanes and airports. On the one hand, my neighbour the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman) is very keen to see Schofields general aviation airport closed down, and thus avoid the imposts of this bill. Equally, we are both very keen to see Badgerys Creek start up and see the imposition of these increases being met by aircraft taking off and landing there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All honourable members accept that we need to explore fully the opportunities for private enterprise involvement at Badgerys Creek airport. However, the FAC seems quite determined to ensure that it maximises its revenue from Sydney (Kingsford Smith) airport and minimises the opportunities for Badgerys Creek to provide competition. We must hope that the Minister for Transport and Communications will authorise a reputable organisation&mdash;one of the banks, such as Macquarie, CFS or First Boston, or whoever&mdash;to scope this proposition. If there is a positive result, we ought to delay no longer and proceed as quickly as possible with Badgerys Creek not only being a general airport, but, more importantly, being an interstate and international airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the answer is in the negative, I think honourable members whose electorates encompass the western suburbs and who take an interest in it, as well as the shadow minister who has spoken on it, need to set aside our reservations for a few years and then look again at the problem. Until such time as it is properly studied in a report and in advice to the government, we have no alternative but to keep the pressure on. I sincerely hope that Minister Collins will accept this challenge and authorise such a study, even if his own department appears reluctant or provides advice to the contrary, because I think it is a logical proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC's own figures of projected traffic indicate that it sees Badgerys Creek getting up and running and taking international passengers much quicker than has hitherto been disclosed to the public, or even in its advice to the government. I find it rather incredible that an organisation like that can play it both ways&mdash;that is, have a public posture which suggests nothing before the year 2010 and then project that in the year 2002 we will be seeing up to 1,000 international aircraft movements a year. It is absolutely incredible. In fact, if I had not seen it, I would have argued that it was impossible. Perhaps General Gration will move on to become Chairman of the FAC. I am sure if that were the case we would see a consistency and honesty from the FAC that we have yet to witness from it. But perhaps he has got enough challenges in the civil aviation field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to wind up my remarks by saying that those on both sides of the House, as is the case with a lot of legislation, support this measure. I hope that the airport at Badgerys Creek will provide quite a lot of revenue to the Civil Aviation Authority for its standards and regulation. I live for the day when we will see an international airport there which provides an alternative to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) airport and which will actually be capable of providing some competition in terms of services and charges. This means it will not only play its part as Sydney's second airport but also fill the coffers of the Civil Aviation Authority in order that our exceptionally high aviation standards can be maintained and possibly improved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Departure Tax Amendment Bill 1993 amends the Departure Tax Act 1978 to increase the departure tax from $20 to $25. That new fee will commence on 1 January 1994. The decision was announced in the budget and will provide a boost to revenue of $11 million in this financial year and $28 million to $30 million in a full year. The tax, in terms of its amount, is similar to such taxes imposed in comparable countries, such as the USA, Japan, Canada, Hong Kong and Germany. The increase was seen by the industry as preferable to the imposition of an arrivals tax which was floated prior to the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about this tax is its history. If we look at what has occurred over the years we see that the amount collected from it is reasonably comparable to the growth in the number of international tourists in Australia and the amount of money allocated by governments of both political persuasions in terms of funding of the Australian Tourist Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax, as I mentioned, was first introduced in 1978 as a result of a recommendation of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism which made 46 recommendations in its final report, including one to introduce a departure tax to fund the Australian Tourist Commission. I must say that the government of the day immediately took that on board and introduced it straight away. I also have a confession to make, in as much as I was chairman of the select committee which recommended the introduction of the departure tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of overall funding, we have had a relationship between the amount collected through the departure tax and the amount spent by the Australian Tourist Commission. It is true, too, that the government has announced some further increases in tourism funding, especially for regional tourism, over the next few years. It would argue that the extra money will be taken from this particular allocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite interested to see in the House today the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) because one of the things I was going to refer to was the growth in tourism and the potential for tourism to become a milch cow of governments of all political persuasions if we are not particularly careful. I say for the sake of the honourable member that the latest figures I have just received show incredible growth at Cairns international airport. Having had some connection in the early 1980s with the promotion of Cairns as an international destination overseas, it is quite amazing to think that, in the year ended May this year, there were 936,915 passengers processed through Cairns airport. Cairns airport is now the fifth busiest in Australia. It is an indication of the incredible strength that tourism has gained in Australia&mdash;an incredible strength that continues to grow, and will do so for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must be careful to make sure that tourism does not become a milch cow for all and sundry in government to start making money, because tourism by its very nature is a fickle industry. It is very cost sensitive. One of the things that scare me more than anything is that almost weekly in various newspapers we read about local government authorities, state government authorities or, indeed, this government talking about imposing additional taxes on tourists to make sure they can provide some of this infrastructure. We should never forget the enormous contribution that tourism makes through the general tax arrangements in Australia&mdash;through sales taxes, through excise taxes, through income taxes. I think I am right in saying that last year that in itself was worth about $7 billion to the Australian Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, there are taxes to visit the Great Barrier Reef; in some parts of Australia there is a bed tax. We now have this proposition&mdash;and I am delighted to see the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) at the table&mdash;for a fringe benefits tax, which was really going to cause some heartache and real problems for the industry. All the way down the line tourism is seen as a relatively easy means of making extra money to fund some of these government programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The warning should be that the industry must be very aware of some of these moves and must make sure that those moves do not price Australia out of the international market. One of the greatest things we have going for us at the moment has been the decline in the value of the Australian dollar. Australia at this stage, quite frankly, is one of the best value for money destinations in the world. In previous years we have seen some hiccups in the market when additional charges were introduced. Therefore, as I say, we have to be vigilant and we have to make sure that we do not get to a stage where we start pricing ourselves out of that international market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I would like to talk about briefly this afternoon is the method of collection of the departure tax. It has been of concern to me ever since the tax was introduced 15 years ago. There are various ways of collecting these taxes. A separate organisation has been established in Australia. There are cages at international airports where people line up to pay their money to leave the country. Early in the piece there were fights with the airlines. The airlines virtually refused to collect the departure tax on behalf of the government, although this method is used in many ports overseas. I note that the government keeps referring to the fact that this is an efficient and cost-effective way of picking up the departure tax. In actual fact, it does cost a great deal of money&mdash;hundreds of thousands of dollars every year&mdash;to sell those stamps in the cages at the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we may congratulate ourselves on the standard of promotion of Australian tourism, the best form of promotion is word of mouth advertising. When word gets around, often wrongly, that Australia is regarded as a somewhat expensive destination&mdash;through statements such as that when a person wants to leave the country he has to line up to pay $25 to get out of the place&mdash;I think we have to be careful. It is interesting to note that about 111 countries around the world impose some sort of departure tax and many more have taxes for the use of aviation infrastructure. I suppose one of the best examples of that is the United States. Most people do not know that when they go to the United States taxes in excess of $US30 are imposed on them. People very rarely pay those taxes directly; they are incorporated in the price of the ticket. It would seem to me that this is the most sensible way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not really examined properly in Australia the prospect of including these prices and charges within the cost of the airline ticket. It would not require an army at the airports to line up to sell the tickets to departing tourists and residents. It would not require the airlines to issue and collect the stamps and account for the money that is being collected. It would require Australia joining some sort of bank settlement plan similar to that used by the airlines to take the collection. Obviously there would be a fee involved, but it would be an efficient way of collecting the tax. Most importantly, it would take away that feeling that some international visitors have that Australia is an expensive place because they have to line up to pay money to get out of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look around the world, we see that a number of our charges are a great deal less than those imposed by overseas countries. For example, in the United Kingdom the cost to move in and out of an airport is the equivalent of about $60, but in that case nobody realises that he is paying those charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we already have an example in Australia of what can be done. Once again it centres around that magnificent airport in Cairns in the middle of the federal division of Leichhardt. A specific tax is imposed on visitors, both domestic and international passengers, in and out of Cairns. That tax, the airport handling charge, is incorporated in the price of the ticket. If one were to travel through Cairns, one would note that the charge is listed on the ticket coupon, but if 95 per cent of the passengers who travel through Cairns were to be asked whether there was a charge involved very few of them would have any realisation that this passenger handling charge is there. That system should be examined as soon as possible, partly because of the public relations image that the present system portrays of Australia and partly because I believe it would be a much more efficient system of collecting the departure tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth of international tourism to Australia has really been quite enormous over the last 15 years. It is 15 years since the international visitor numbers started to grow. A little earlier I mentioned the growth in the figures for Cairns airport. When we consider that in the year to the end of May 1993 something like 9.675 million passengers passed through Australia's international airports we are given an indication of just how big the tourism industry is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the growth in the collection of the departure tax over the years, we see that only five years ago we collected $64 million and last year we collected $92 million. So there is some big revenue involved. I believe there is an opportunity to make sure that we continue the promotion of Australian tourism as best as we possibly can in overseas countries through this formula of roughly using the departure tax as a means of funding the Australian Tourist Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Departure Tax Amendment Bill 1993 provides for the increase in the departure tax from $20 to $25. This measure announced in the budget is to take effect from 1 January next year. The tax is expected to bring about a 90 per cent increase in the revenue raised, estimated to be $11 million in 1993-94. As the increase only takes effect from 1 January, the revenue raised in the next financial year is expected to increase by a larger amount, as the new rate will be collected for the full financial year. As has already been mentioned by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), the expected increase is $28 million in 1994-95, $30 million in 1995-96 and $32 million in 1996-97.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At $25, Australia's departure tax will now be around the same level as the charges imposed on international travellers by authorities in the United States and Fiji and is actually below those levied in Japan, Hong Kong and Canada and a number of European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Greece and Germany. As the honourable member for Fadden has already indicated in what I consider to have been a very bipartisan contribution to the debate, this increase will offset the additional cost of tourism promotion expenditure announced in the budget. An additional $80 million was allocated to boost the development of new tourism products and for tourism promotion over the next four years, including an extra $8 million in 1993-94 and $10 million per annum to 1996-97 for overseas market development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Far North Queensland tourism industry, centred on my electorate of Leichhardt, appreciates the value of promotion and the importance of having guaranteed sources of funding for these activities. This has been supported by recent comments by the Chairman of the Australian Tourism Industry Association, who described the increase as `a small additional cost to travellers'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Fadden must have been reading my notes because I agree with him that no-one, least of all me and my tourism based constituency of Leichhardt, wants to see the tourism industry treated as some sort of milch cow. However, there is a general acceptance within the tourism industry and amongst other interested parties, including environmentalists and travellers themselves, that there is a degree of room in the industry for user pays principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is acknowledged that Australia's tourism sector is in its adolescence. I describe it as such because it is youthful, growing fast and requires a lot of sustenance. Strong, vigorous and healthy adults are not created from diets of bread and water. This government is the first Australian government to recognise this and to really nourish our tourism industry to ensure its future viability and vitality. This was clearly evidenced in the tourism initiatives included in this government's budget&mdash;a tourism focused budget that has in the main been accepted, approved and applauded by peak tourism groups in my electorate, including the Far North Queensland Promotion Bureau. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Far North Queensland Promotion Bureau, headed by a very capable and committed Geoff Donaghy, has commended the $80 million in tourist initiatives marked in this budget. Of particular interest to the bureau is the $23 million in funding available over the next four years to the regional tourism development program. The bureau is recognised throughout Australia as a leader in regional tourism strategy. Yesterday it unveiled a draft of the Cairns regional tourism strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four main aims of this strategy are to diversify tourism to support and sustain the economic growth of the region, to coordinate the delivery of infrastructure and services to support tourism, to ensure sustainable use of the region's natural and cultural assets, and to establish appropriate organisational structures to manage and develop the industry. Geoff Donaghy and the bureau ought to be congratulated on these far-sighted objectives. I look forward to working with him and the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) in the future in order to ensure that his far-sighted strategy is implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far North Queensland tourism operators and their organisations know of the importance of planning for the future. This program, and the programs that are set out in the budget, will provide funds for the development of strategic plans, the development of local tourism and infrastructure and the coordination of tourism information on a regional basis. My electorate includes some of Australia's most significant ecotourism destinations. The Daintree rainforest, the rest of the World Heritage Wet Tropics and the Great Barrier Reef all fall within the electorate of Leichhardt. So it is no wonder that considerable support has been expressed for the implementation of the $10 million national ecotourism strategy currently being formulated. Funding will be provided for a program to complement the work of the states, environmental groups and tourism organisations in promoting sustainable tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> Mr Donaghy of the Far North Queensland Promotion Bureau estimated that $1.6 billion was required for supporting public sector infrastructure in Far North Queensland over the next 10 years. As the honourable member for Fadden has mentioned, we already have a reef levy. In my region there is also a small levy for visitors to Kuranda. In the May 1993 report on the Cairns regional economy, produced by the Cairns Economic Research Unit, research fellow Tim Nevard noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These two examples&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he was referring to those two small levies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">indicate that at certain key areas within the Region, the environment has reached or passed its capacity to absorb further tourism development without significant additional funding.</PARA>
<PARA>He asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is the increased cost of the visitor experience likely to have a disproportionate and economically damaging effect on the number of visitors?</PARA>
<PARA>He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the small amounts involved, any effect is likely to be extremely marginal and unlikely to have any measurable impact on commercial revenues . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I believe the Far North Queensland experience forms a micro view of the situation nationally. We need a coordinated national approach to tourism promotion and development and it has to be paid for through a breadth of approaches. The small increase in the departure tax, as outlined in this bill, forms just one small part of this. I have to say, partly in response to the honourable member for Fadden, that it is stating the obvious that, if the $1.6 billion suggested by Mr Donaghy is in any way accurate, all levels of government face an enormous fiscal challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming from Far North Queensland, I recognise the enormous contribution that the Queensland tourism industry makes to the Australian economy as a whole, as the honourable member for Fadden has referred to. Nevertheless, it is my hope that we can meet the challenge with the cooperation of the government and industry. I suspect, with some respect to the honourable member for Fadden, that the tourism industry may be a little ahead of him here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in my speech I talked about milch cows, as did the honourable member for Fadden. I accept that the tourism industry cannot be a milch cow. Nevertheless, I detect in the tourism industry a recognition of the fact that there is a requirement for infrastructure and that it cannot be met by existing funding arrangements. Local government has great difficulty meeting it. It is something that challenges federal, state and local governments. I hope that it does not become a political issue and that we can all sit down and address the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to commend the acknowledgment by this government of the important role played by the backpacker market in Australian tourism. Anyone who has visited Cairns, the reef or the Daintree region will know how important this market sector is to the economy of Far North Queensland and Australia more generally. But its genesis has been organic. The backpacker market needs some assistance to make sure it can continue to provide good value holiday experiences to young people from around the world for a long time to come. After all, they will be the five-star travellers of tomorrow. The Commonwealth is to provide support to develop this market with an aim to remove impediments to growth, encourage a strategic approach and ensure a positive return to the economy. Funding will encourage the promotion of standards in the backpacker accommodation sector, an initiative I believe is very urgent. The Australian Tourist Commission will identify marketing opportunities and increase the promotion of backpacker accommodation in consultation with youth hostels and backpacker associations. When I speak to the tourism operators of Far North Queensland, one message keeps coming through: we need information to help us plan. We already have a building lull as a result of the oversupply from the late 1980s. No-one wants to see that happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the appointment of Frank Conroy as the chairman of the newly created Tourism Forecasting Council will be applauded. Mr Conroy is a former managing director of the Westpac Banking Corporation and the current chairman of the FAC. He will be joined on the council by representatives from a range of industries directly reliant on tourism, and he is well aware of the need for sound information on the future prospects for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tourism Forecasting Council will comprise a high profile reporting body, including the peak tourism industry, finance and building sector organisations. The group will be supported by a technically oriented advisory body. This is long overdue. The council will provide medium- and long-term forecasts for future tourism growth as well as the supply and demand for accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some industry commentators argue that occupancy rates in key centres, including Cairns, suggest that new accommodation will need to be financed in the near future. I commend the council for determining this as an area of priority on which it will be able to focus its early efforts. The tourism industry has never before had access to such high quality forecasting. It is absolutely essential and has been welcomed as such by the industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report from the Far North Queensland Promotion Bureau and its draft plan again emphasise that the key to providing the appropriate infrastructure for Far North Queensland will be the establishment of a regional tourism information system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I again refer to the comments made by the honourable member for Fadden, and I look forward to a future whereby, as with a lot of issues in this House, we can approach the issue of infrastructure for the tourism industry on a bipartisan basis. As I said earlier, it will require cooperation from the federal, state and local governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As much as I would wish it, all those governments are not always Labor governments. These issues have to be resolved with a degree of cooperation because they are urgent. Federal, state and local governments have other fiscal restraints. The honourable member for Fadden is quite right in saying that the tourism industry does supply a great deal of income to the Australian economy. Nevertheless, the fact is that, if the figures that I cited from Mr Donaghy are correct, then there is a need for some massive expenditure. As I said, that perhaps needs some innovative thought on behalf of the tourism industry and all levels of government. By `innovative', I mean that we might have to think about some form of taxation. We cannot avoid that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the government of the day will sit down with the tourism industry and come up with a resolution that everyone agrees with. I hope that whoever is in opposition&mdash;I am confident that the honourable member for Fadden will remain in opposition in this House for a long time&mdash;cooperates with any future plan that is brought up in that area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the remarks of the shadow minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull). No member in this chamber has a better understanding of the tourist industry, its background and the policies that might make Australia a better tourist destination for international travellers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I preface my remarks by saying that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, would be very happy about this particular measure because it is a money raising measure. As we all know, the Assistant Treasurer and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) need as much money as they can get to try to make up the budget deficit. Whilst both sides of the parliament might disagree with some aspects of the departure tax, fundamentally, it is a measure to get more money into the coffers of the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Departure Tax Amendment Bill seeks to raise the departure tax payable at Australian air and shipping ports from $20 to $25 effective from 1 January 1994. That in itself does not seem a very big rise, but each year it appears that governments put just a little bit more on the departure tax, which is a greater imposition on tourists. The departure tax was first introduced in 1978 at $10 a passenger. In 1981-82, it became $20. It has moved up and down to either $10 or $20 a passenger in various later budget decisions. So the poor old tourists and passengers continue to pay this tax, which I am aware is paid in other parts of the world. Governments are very keen to take their pound of flesh from tourists, but there is a price, as the honourable member for Fadden has pointed out and other honourable members will be pointing out. Inevitably, tourists resist paying too much by way of departure and entry taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a full year, the government says that the boost to revenue will be about $28 million to $30 million on top of the $92.2 million collected last year. The collection costs for this tax are quite high. This financial year, with 5.2 million transactions for the tax, the government will be paying a collection agent, Australia Post, about $4.2 million or 81c per transaction. That in itself is a problem and we should be very aware of the cost, and inconvenience in some cases, of collecting this tax from the passengers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of transactions does not always equal the number of people who pay the departure tax. For instance, 300,000 children under 12 who leave Australia for overseas each year are exempt, but Australia Post still charges a processing fee for exemption stamps that are needed to identify these children. Australia Post's involvement with collections of this tax dates from 1986. At that time, the airlines were made responsible for collection and they appointed Australia Post as an agent. In 1986, all the revenue from this tax went back into aviation. I think this is a key point: the tax, as originally imposed, went back into aviation. But this has changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988, the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority were formed. In 1989, tenders for collection of the departure tax were called. Australia Post won a three-year contract in 1990, which was subsequently extended in 1992 until 30 June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that since 1988 half of the revenue from the tax has been channelled back into general revenue, with the other 50 per cent being split equally between immigration and tourism promotion. So we see this fundamental problem that, whilst in the initial stages the departure tax was always promoted on the basis that it would help the tourism and immigration areas, a proportion of that tax moves back into general revenue. Initially, half of what was then a $10 departure tax was notionally given to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs as a replacement for the previous immigration clearance fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hypothecation is of course an old political argument both in this area and in road funding. It is unrealistic to expect governments to endorse widely the principle that moneys collected in one area should be spent in that area. It is a problem. The Assistant Treasurer agrees with me. From his point of view, hypothecation is always a difficulty, and I am inclined to accept that viewpoint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in passing that the government's claims of an $80 million boost for tourism funding over four years should be read in light of the $30 million each year in extra taxes that will come from what seems an innocuous $5 hike in each person's departure tax. It is just as I said earlier: the $5 extra generates a fair bit of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end of this collection contract on 30 June 1994 raises some dilemmas for the government. Since 20 per cent of the revenue comes from passengers leaving for New Zealand, any establishment of a common aviation market between Australia and our Kiwi cousins would mean the ending of that proportion of revenue overnight. We have an interesting dilemma on our own doorstep in that the tax might be reduced if we are to do the right thing by our close neighbour, New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A common aviation market is highly desirable between our two countries. The shadow minister, who is at the table, agrees entirely with that. Both he and I have had discussions in New Zealand about those propositions and how there might be greater cooperation between the two nations in terms of aviation and agricultural products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the timing could not be worse for any of the public servants in the Department of Transport and Communications who might be trying to decide whether to extend Australia Post's contract or call for new tenders. Part of the difficulty is that I understand Australia Post's contract can be extended only once more. So we have a difficulty with the administration of this tax which involves personal difficulties to passengers. Honourable members who have travelled overseas would know that if one is lucky enough to be at the airport and have the right amount of money one can pay the departure tax. If one does not have the right amount of money, it causes considerable administrative inconvenience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem is that, if tenders are called with a start-up date of July 1994, the bidders might face some uncertainty in the costs they will have to build into any of the proposals. Ansett, and probably Qantas, will begin operating international services from domestic terminals. We do not know exactly when, but this will require additional collection points for any tenderer&mdash;even at integrated international and domestic airports such as Melbourne. This will obviously reduce the government's revenue to some extent by pushing up the tender prices quoted to collect the departure tax, so the budget estimates might not even be met. The government should get its act together with respect to aviation policy. If tenders are to be called for a contract commencing in July next year, they would surely need to be advertised by January at the latest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that speakers have alluded to is the government's oft repeated claim that tourism is going through boom times. We can be pleased that the average annual growth in international air arrivals and departures between 1986 and 1992 at Australia's six main international gateways varied from 5.3 per cent at Melbourne, 6.5 per cent at Sydney, 14.7 per cent at Brisbane&mdash;that is the airport of the honourable member for Fadden and I know he uses that airport a lot during his working life, so he is very familiar with the increased traffic at that airport&mdash;to a massive 42.3 per cent at Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw honourable members' attention to Cairns airport, which I have had the privilege of inspecting. I compliment the port authority on its foresight in developing an international airport at Cairns and seeing an opening in the international passenger market which it could service. It has done this in a cost-effective manner using local capital. It has certainly created a tourism market of its own, independent of other airports around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I caution the government that our performance at least in air arrivals and departures is simply not matching what is appearing in Asia and other parts of the world. Between 1986 and 1990&mdash;the latest years for which figures could be made available&mdash;the average annual percentage change in combined arrivals and departures at Jakarta in Indonesia was 11.3 per cent. For comparison, in those years, Melbourne's growth was 7.8 per cent and Sydney's was only 6.8 per cent. We can see from those figures that there was an increase in departures and arrivals at the airport at Jakarta in the Asian area. The percentage change during that period at Tokyo was 17.7 per cent; at Changi in Singapore, 12.8 per cent; and at Bangkok, a massive 16.9 per cent. I say `massive' because Thailand's arrivals and departures at its international airports totalled almost 11 million persons, which is more than Australia's six busiest airports could manage in the year 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must not discourage visitors such as backpackers&mdash;who spent on average almost $3,800 each in 1992 compared with $1,760 for other visitors&mdash;by excessive taxation measures like the departure tax that is proposed in this bill. I agree with the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) that the backpacker market is a very important aspect of the tourist operation in Australia. As he so quite rightly says, the backpackers of today are the tourists of tomorrow. The backpacking operation is certainly a growth market. Backpackers spend their dollars in the local areas, wherever they might be touring around Australia. I know that backpackers certainly congregate in the Cairns area of Queensland. Their injection into that economy is quite massive. I hope that the government will encourage the backpacker operation. I support the whole view that backpackers will be the tourists of tomorrow and that they do help local economies. Australia provides opportunities for visitors to have low cost holidays and, as a result, backpackers will spread some goodwill about all the good tourist destinations that are here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If every tax charge and fee that these price and quality conscious visitors faced increased overnight by about 25 per cent as this tax proposes to do, we would see more than the five per cent drop in backpacker numbers that occurred between 1990 and 1992. We might be drawing a long bow by saying that it was the departure tax that caused the drop-off. Obviously, there were a number of other factors, but backpackers look at every dollar very carefully and it is those considerable overheads that cause them to make decisions about whether they might come to Australia or whether they might go to other Asian nations with lower overhead costings. So this government should not be complacent about the role of tourism in the national economy. Everything that the government and members of the opposition can do to encourage tourism to Australia and develop over the longer term the facilities, the image and the way in which we promote tourism is very important to industry as we come up to the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As in industrial relations, as in the business of government and as in social policy, the comparisons Australia makes in tourism cannot be how we as a nation performed two, three or 20 years ago. We should make those comparisons of how Australia is performing in this whole tourist market with other nations around the world. How are we competing and comparing with the Asian market and its rates of growth? How are we comparing with the USA market, which provided a boom some three or four years ago here in Australia? How are we comparing with the European market in tourist growth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in my mind that the tourist potential of Australia is enormous. We have this uncluttered land mass of pristine wilderness. We have some tourist attractions that cannot be matched in Asia or Europe. If we can provide the facilities, infrastructure and right attitude within the tourist industry, I am sure we will attract these tourists from overseas destinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the government will not increase the departure tax to any greater degree than is competitive on the world market. Whilst a $5 increase does not seem much, it all adds to the overheads. When people overseas put together a package the departure tax becomes part of the package deal. If it becomes too excessive, we will not get the tourists that we have been anticipating. </PARA>

With the greatest respect to the honourable member, that is a very inaccurate reflection of the way the tourism industry has grown in Australia in the last decade. It is an industry that, traditionally, until the Labor government came to power, was not really recognised as a proper industry as it is today. It was not recognised that the Commonwealth government had a role to play in the industry. A body such as the Australian Tourist Commission, with its potential to harness the development of the tourism industry, was not seen as an important item on the agenda. Indeed, in elections since that time, opposition members have often gone to the polls advocating the abolition of the Australian Tourist Commission. Such is the priority they place on the coordination and development of our tourism infrastructure and industry. Such is the prominence they think an industry such as tourism should have in marketing around the world. They think the Commonwealth government should just opt out of it and leave it to the piecemeal adhockery that was a feature of tourism development in the past. </PARA>

That suggests we need to be conscious of the importance of price, but I suspect that when tourists from countries such as Germany come here&mdash;they number 100,000 a year and hopefully more as time goes on&mdash;the diversity of attractions that exist in Australia is the reason why they choose to come such a long distance to Australia for a holiday when they could be going elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent discussions about safety of holidays to the United States and so on, it was clear that people in Germany and other countries in Europe are increasingly looking to Australia and seeing the opportunities that exist here for outback holidays and for a diverse range of activities. Also, the prominence that the Sydney Olympic bid has given to tourism opportunities has helped to enhance interest around the world in Australia as a desirable tourist destination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So rather than the negative approach of asking whether this additional $5 departure tax will undermine tourism, we should be recognising the fairly major achievements over recent times of the Australian Tourist Commission, with its campaigns and its coordination with state tourist commissions to try to develop a more strategic approach among the states, the Commonwealth and the industry. As the honourable member for Corangamite mentioned, when the departure tax came into place in the past, all the money went to aviation development. That was shown to be one of the deficiencies in the approach adopted; not enough Commonwealth energy was going into promoting and marketing Australia abroad. The changes that have taken place over the last few years in the way we harness our effort, and the growth in tourism marketing, are fundamental to creating a greater awareness of Australia around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to appreciate that it is a very competitive industry. There are a lot of holiday options for people from Asia or Europe. Unless we keep getting our message across about the attractiveness of our product, we will lose out to those who are prepared to market. We need to spell out the virtues of, and opportunities in, Australia. It is not just aviation or roads infrastructure that we need or other facilities such as hotels and tourism resorts; we also need to market the product in a fairly precise and coordinated fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In part, that is what departure tax funds have been used for over the last few years. As is clearly spelled out in the budget papers, part of the reason for the increase in the departure tax from the beginning of 1994 is to enhance the effort that has been added to in the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and in a variety of initiatives taken since that time, to provide more impetus to that growth. We had a big growth in tourism throughout the 1980s. Some people said that growth would be hard to sustain as time went on and that it would be hard to keep it going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of us who have had a keen interest in the industry know that, with concerted effort, Australia can continue to help the industry grow in a very major fashion through this decade and beyond. The increasing mobility, flexibility and convenience of travel provide that opportunity. Price competitiveness is very important. Very few people would travel from Australia to Europe or Japan, then look at the price equation of travelling from Europe or Japan to Australia, and not say that our pricing structures generally for hotels, fares, packages and all the rest are very competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Japan, even with its recession, people have continued to take a very strong interest in coming to Australia, in large measure because of our price competitiveness and the desirability of the product&mdash;the tourism industry has developed products suitable to that market. Many in Japan claim that such things are not always readily available if they go to the United States and other places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not rest on our laurels. It is important to maintain the price competitiveness in everything we do. We have to develop an advantage in price because of the distance people have to travel to get here, compared with going to other regions. But I do not believe we can sustain an argument that the increase in departure tax will be a pivotal factor. In looking at it from the reverse perspective, that is, of how much extra benefit we will get from greater promotion and awareness of Australia overseas, I am very confident that the equation has been developed in the right way, with the package of the departure tax and the increased expenditure on tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth mentioning a few facts. Exports in the tourism industry have represented 10 per cent of our export earnings over the last year. That is substantial. The level of employment at the moment is near the 500,000 figure&mdash;and that is a very substantial growth compared with a decade or more ago when the industry was not even identified in statistics as a real industry. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have a good understanding of this industry, being from a part of New South Wales which is very much involved and interested in tourism and has developed it dramatically in the last decade. I note, from recent reports, that there are increasing moves to expand the flexibility of the infrastructure with charter flights and other important things in places such as Coffs Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism has developed in other places along the coast. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who is in the chamber, can relate to this matter as well. In the various inquiries we have conducted in the past into customs and other matters, similar sorts of issues have been raised of allowing government policy to have flexibility. That is important. At the same time, there is a recognition that there will be costs as far as immigration, customs and other services are concerned. They should be developed in a way that is commensurate with the accrued economic benefit and the need to have flexible travel into Australia by charter, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those things have been implemented. The House should acknowledge some of the achievements made in tourism and the way the tourism industry has developed its professionalism. It has moved dramatically from where it was a few years ago. Sydney is still a very popular destination for visitors to Australia&mdash;first arrivals like to come to Sydney. I am sure that with the successful bid for the Olympic Games over the next few years many more will be doing so, as part of a broader visit to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of selling has been the coordination between regions around New South Wales and the packaging of North Queensland, Sydney and some of the other desirable places to which a large number of tourists go. We can do that in a comprehensive way only if we are prepared to spend some of the funds that have been identified and which the Tourist Commission has used in its strategic marketing campaigns around the world; integrating that with other government and private sector initiatives in those regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a campaign in Japan called Celebrate Australia. When I was there recently I was very pleased to see just how many cities in Japan have taken an interest in this. Funds and resources have been provided through the embassy and a large number of private sector firms. An expenditure of around $40 million is being outlaid in Japan this month on Celebrate Australia. Of that, the direct contribution from the public sector amounts&mdash;in various facets&mdash;to some $4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was certainly the view of people I spoke to in Japan that the reason others had the interest and impetus to get involved in this campaign was that the embassy, through the resources it developed, had a serious interest in the issue. If there had not been some commitment from the Commonwealth&mdash;from us as a nation&mdash;to this initiative, it would have been much harder to get private sector firms, and Japanese tourism industry firms, to say, `We want to sign up and make a contribution to that campaign.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the role for the funds we provide through the Tourist Commission is to be a catalyst and facilitator in getting others to take an active part in these sorts of campaigns. Some 32 cities across Japan are involved very actively in Celebrate Australia. There has been tremendous interest from chambers of commerce and travel associations across cities such as Osaka, Nagoya and so on. Most of the people who are experts and operators in the field say Australia could not have hoped to get that attention had not the initial drive come from us in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we need a tourist commission and that is why it needs to be adequately funded, so that we can get the drive that those sorts of things bring and get the private sector interest and sponsorship that binds the whole process together strongly. To maintain that momentum some adjustment&mdash;I admit we must get the balance right&mdash;and increase in the departure tax is entirely justifiable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expenditure on air time, promotion, and the literature that is being produced in Japan about Celebrate Australia has to be the most cost effective that we could possibly hope for at a national level. Notwithstanding the recession in Japan, the number of Japanese tourists coming to Australia has kept growing. At a time when the overall movement of Japanese tourists abroad has not shown substantial growth, tourism to Australia has maintained a healthy trend. Keeping that trend going will be a challenge for us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to all Australians who are involved in the Celebrate Australia campaign, including the government agencies and the people associated with the embassies. It is interesting to note that a number of Australians resident in Japan have volunteered to be part of this exercise. They are very dedicated and committed people who have volunteered hours and hours of their time. The embassy staff has put a tremendous effort into this campaign, as have the various consulate offices around Japan, believing fundamentally that Australia is a great place to promote because it has a product that is worth promoting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as importantly, there is an audience in Japan which genuinely believes we have a great product. The Japanese love to come to Australia. This does not happen by accident. Similar sorts of exercises have been undertaken in other parts of Asia, and we will need to keep doing this. Part of the reason why there is so much enthusiasm across the Japanese tourism industry is that it believes that, as a nation, we are serious about tourism and promoting our product. The Japanese believe tourists who come to Australia get value for money. They believe Australia provides cost effective holidays when compared with the costs of hotels and so on in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw a newspaper article a couple of days ago which compared the cost of hotel accommodation in Sydney with that of hotel accommodation in 10 other generally comparable cities around the world. It showed that the cost of a four- or five-star hotel in Sydney averaged about a third or less of the cost of hotels in most cities around Europe. Members of parliament who have had the opportunity to travel overseas would realise that the cost of hotel accommodation in Europe, in particular, is very high compared with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to be competitive with the Asian market. There are more and more people from Asian countries who are mobile and who are keen to undertake travel abroad. Increasingly, we get the impression that they want to come to Australia because they regard Australia as offering very diverse attractions. Many parts of rural and regional Australia are interesting. We have many historical landmarks, as well as great cities such as Sydney and all that it has to offer, including the Blue Mountains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can promote all of those things because the dynamics of our tourism industry are built upon the government impetus provided through the Tourism Advisory Council and the active cooperation of tourism bodies across the nation. Furthermore, through the measures provided in part by the additional funding in this year's budget, we now have the impetus to develop regional and localised tourism packages that can fit in nicely with our national objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a very positive step. We need to recognise the importance of that competitive mix in regional Australia and give these areas the opportunity to coordinate their resources. Many of us have probably been members of tourism associations, doing our own thing without necessarily being concerned about the adjacent regions. The regional tourism strategy contained in this budget&mdash;which has been allocated funding as a result of this departure tax arrangement&mdash;allows for more coordination of those arrangements and for more strategic planning in regional tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can certainly identify the capacity for that to occur in my own region of western Sydney. There are many attractions to promote in that area&mdash;from the Blue Mountains to areas such as Parramatta, which is the second oldest city in Australia. The Olympic Games will provide a much greater development impetus than we have seen in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members should be coming into this House giving positive support to our tourism industry, commending the initiatives that have been undertaken, and recognising that its active promotion overseas is part and parcel of a competitive tourism industry. That is what the departure tax increase is designed to achieve, and I have pleasure in supporting the bill before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in this wide ranging debate on the Departure Tax Amendment Bill. While this bill deals only with the departure tax, we have had a general debate about the tourist industry. Over the last couple of months, we have been restricted in debating matters of public importance in this House. But I believe this matter is as important as any we could debate because it has far reaching ramifications right across Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), certainly alerted the House to the benefits of tourism as they exist in Australia today. I must pay a compliment to the shadow minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who is in the chamber today. In his own way, he has spear-headed an approach to tourism unequalled in this parliament for many years. People complain that it has been only in the last 10 years that tourism has really been given its head; but that is not quite true. Until the Fraser government gave its commitment to internationalise the Cairns airport&mdash;with all the benefits that that has brought to North Queensland&mdash;tourism was going nowhere; particularly in the north. We have to be fair in looking at the past, even as we look to the future. I pay tribute to the honourable member for Fadden for the work he has done within the tourism portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us increases the departure tax from $20 to $25&mdash;a $5 increase. Initially it was $10 in 1978 under the Fraser government. The budgeted revenue is estimated to be an additional $11 million for 1993-94; $28 million for 1994-95; $30 million for 1995-96; and $32 million for 1996-97. Once we stabilise the rate, the figures indicate a three or four per cent increase in tourism in the remaining three of those four years. That is a fair figure, considering that, according to the estimates, growth in Australia will be limited to less than three per cent. It also recognises that the rest of the world regards Australia as a safe destination for tourists, with many world acclaimed destinations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should never forget that. When I come back to our shores from overseas&mdash;and I speak particularly about the Barrier Reef&mdash;there is nothing in the world that equals the sun, sand and surf of the Queensland beaches or Queensland itself. People can go to the Bahamas, the Mediterranean, or anywhere in the world but they will not find anything like we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beauty is that, at this stage, Australia is relatively untouched. There are certainly areas in Australia that I believe have been overcommitted and overcommercialised to the point where they are now just concrete jungles. But most of Australia is there awaiting the proper development of resources. In looking at the figures, our real fear should be whether Australia will be in a position to cope with the additional number of tourists and provide the additional services and facilities that the world will be demanding. That is a problem we will have to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to the effect that the Olympic Games will have on Australian tourism through the number of overseas visitors to our shores. Taking the year 2000 as a benchmark, the games will provide the impetus for an increase in foreign visitors to Australia. Events such as the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane in 1982 and Expo in 1988 had a tremendous influence on the increased tourist intake into Australia. The figures certainly indicate that Queensland is leading this tourist push, but that is not to deny that the other states are doing their share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very happy to be able to report that the additional revenue from the bill will be used for the promotion of tourism right across Australia. The Australian Tourist Commission at this stage has a budget of $103 million, which includes an amount of $25 million from the industry itself. That is creditable because we need a partnership if we are going to develop tourism to its full potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with my colleague the honourable member for Fadden that for too long tourism facilities and programs have regarded each other as being in opposition instead of in competition with each other and their attitude has been `If we do not get it within our particular region we do not want it at all'. I do not believe that is the right attitude. I make the point that it is a grave pity, when we realise how much Queensland contributes towards that tourist dollar, that there is no Queenslander appointed to the Australian Tourist Commission. It is all right to say that we have to balance the whole thing up and look right across Australia but when there are eight commissioners I believe one from Queensland should have been appointed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand there are new programs being provided by the Australian Tourist Commission that will enhance that competition but I hope that we do not have the fiasco that we heard of earlier this week of the latest advertising of Qantas being filmed offshore. I think this is another Australian cringe. Australian business and Australians themselves do not believe they are good enough or have the expertise to do this type of advertising publication themselves. If there is a lesson to be learnt from that fiasco it is that the government, Australian instrumentalities and Australian business would do well to look at the expertise in Australia before they go outside looking for the big names, because bigger is not always best. We have had that cringe in Australia of not being able to recognise Australian talent and Australian content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures in connection with the departures of overseas tourists from Australia over the years show again an increase in the number from Queensland. I believe it is a favoured destination and the statistics prove it. In 1987, Queensland was second only to New South Wales, with 13 per cent of the foreign overseas departures. In 1992, while it was still second to New South Wales, that figure was 26 per cent. That 26 per cent figure seems to be holding firm with the quartiles that have come through since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those figures also show that we have almost as many Australians departing for overseas destinations as we have foreign visitors coming to visit us. I know we have to take out of that the business equation but I do not think this reflects well on Australia. In 1992 we had 2.5 million foreign visitors departing Australia and yet in the same year we had 2.3 million Australians going overseas. That leads me to the conclusion that unfortunately foreigners know more about Australia than we do ourselves. I will read from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 25 May headed `Foreign visitors know most about best isles'. Basically, foreigners know more about the destinations here than we do ourselves. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Germans consider Australia adventurous, Italians view it as glamorous, exotic, quaint, unusual and warm, and Swedish travellers look forward to seeing the natural wonders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And North Queensland certainly offers a range of world-class attractions and facilities for both domestic and international visitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Great Barrier Reef is just one of the unique attractions that is supported by world-class tourism facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet it is often overlooked by Australians who seek what they consider to be the more exotic destinations of islands off Fiji and Vanuatu.</PARA>
<PARA>The comment is also made that many of these resorts are of world class standard. I think there is a lesson to be learnt. It is all very well and good to be doing this promotion overseas but again I add the qualification that I think there is a need for us to be able to promote Australia&mdash;though not with Qantas advertising filmed in Hawaii&mdash;so that more of our own people will travel within our own shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Departure tax applies to both overseas visitors returning and Australians going overseas, but I believe it would be better for the Australian economy if the Australians did not pay that departure tax but visited within their own shores instead. The industry expects that the increase of $5 per departure will be absorbed in other travel costs and will not be a great influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention two things when talking about the attractiveness of Australia and the ability of people to come to our shores. I mention a case that was told to me in the last fortnight. Some very good friends of ours, Ray and Eve Foreman, recently won on handicap the Brisbane-South Pacific yacht race. During the race they mixed with yachties from all over the world. The comment was made that the yachties do not favour Australia as a destination, just to call in and hook up, because of the costs involved in the AQIS inspections that are not part and parcel of many other destinations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is apparently one of about three other island nations that make a charge for AQIS type services. I am not talking about departure tax. The Americans have said they are not going to come onshore and pay $100 or $200 for a part of an hour&mdash;it is only 15 minutes work&mdash;just to have their boat looked at every time they hook into a marina. That comment was made to the Foremans by Americans and also by many other visitors in the South Pacific. So there are tourists who could be accommodated in Australia but who are not being accommodated because of those charges. It is not a great amount but people are price sensitive to those little things. When the Foremans came back as proud winners of the race they were forced to pay an extra $100 to get their boat inspected by AQIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I want to mention concerns never overlooking the internal tourist, the Australian domestic traveller. I know that the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) was castigated here and was called a racist because he brought to the attention of the House an incident where a person from his electorate had gone up to Cairns and found that if he did not pay with yen at certain destinations he could not shop or get the services there. That was his experience. I know of a very similar experience of somebody who travelled up to Ayr, got onto one of the boats, went over to Green Island&mdash;I believe that is run by Daikyo now; I am not sure&mdash;and all he wanted to do, having paid for his trip in Australian dollars, was to go onshore to buy a soft drink. He could not buy a soft drink unless he exchanged his Australian currency for island currency. The alternative was to go without a drink, which he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think those little things count a lot for the Australian tourist. I would hate to think that we are developing a culture within our tourist industry and at certain destinations where favour is given to international tourists and the domestic tourist is overlooked. I think Australia is for Australians and I believe that, while we should offer good services and good destinations, there is no real reason or good excuse for an Australian visiting his own country to have to convert his Australian currency. I understood that in Australia Australian currency has to be accepted as legal tender. I often wonder how destinations such as that can get away with insisting on only yen. Something needs to be done domestically in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, the Australian market is a very lucrative market and one that should be expanded. For quite a while in Mackay we have complained about other difficulties. I believe we are getting our share of the tourist dollar. The thing that I am happy about in my region is that we have not gone overboard and stuck up huge concrete monuments that would despoil the country and which would mean that we probably would not get the visitors that we seek. That is the case in other parts of Australia. But, as my friend the yachtie said, the marinas and berthing facilities could be improved to encourage greater travel along our coast. After all, those people who use the Whitsunday Islands must realise that that is a yachties' paradise. Anyone who visits the place gets hooked on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, Cairns is an established destination, and I would like to repeat something that I said in the past: anyone who charges that the conservatives in government did not think that the tourist industry was important should note that it was the Fraser government that offered $30 million to upgrade the Cairns airport to international standard. Just as importantly, it was the Cairns Port Authority that took over the challenge and spent twice that amount in developing the airport facilities. I understand that Cairns airport is presently getting 60 international flights in and out every week. Of course, the facilities at this airport can tap into the Pacific islands, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and all those Asian markets. Those people who have a yen for travel&mdash;and the yen to spend on it&mdash;will inject very attractive tourist dollars into the economy if we can keep attracting them with such facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Money would be well spent if, when attracting foreign visitors to a particular destination, domestic aircraft offered packages to ensure that our foreign visitors could spread out to the available attractions. Unless they are American, tourists cannot see Australia in one visit. We must ensure that they have more destinations to see than the one at which they arrive. I believe that the new Qantas-Australian Airlines set-up will lead to a greater diversity of destinations for overseas tourists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As noted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 31 August 1993, Cairns is expected to be our second biggest international gateway after Sydney by the year 2000. The director of marketing up there said that, by the year 2000, it is expected that 23 per cent of visitors to Australia will be clearing customs through Cairns compared with about 44 per cent for Sydney. When one realises that Queensland already processes 26 per cent of those visitors, 23 per cent is a great effort from that one airport. So if we can catch the mood and spread those visitors, it will be better to accommodate them right throughout the state and Australia with fly-ons and packages that will benefit the tourists and Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this mass attack on our major international airports, there must be a policy for back-to-back charters that will allow into other airports the types of aircraft now involved in international travel. I do not specifically mean 747s but many of the aircraft now being used on the Asian and New Zealand routes should be able to land at airports in places such as Hamilton Island, Proserpine and Mackay. I believe that it is very important that we go that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to recognise in this debate some of the other great natural attractions to be found in the best electorate in Australia. There is the Great Barrier Reef, a prized destination. Anybody who has visited the Whitsundays and seen the off-shore facilities would also have to recognise Laguna Keys. Foreign currency is being used there to build up facilities on target and to develop a golf course which, it has been suggested by some, is one of the best international golf courses on which they have ever played. Unfortunately, we have yet to get the internationals on the golf course. However, Laguna Keys offers a great on-shore resort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is Club Med on Lindeman Island where the French have seen fit to spend $60 million to enhance that facility as a destination. Developments have been undertaken on quite a lot of the other islands&mdash;Hayman, Hamilton, Brampton, and all along the line. In fact, it thrills me to be able to go into the bills and papers office here and see a big glossy photograph of the Radisson development on Long Island which is right in the middle of the Whitsundays&mdash;right in the middle of my electorate. I might encourage other departments within Parliament House to cover other aspects of the Whitsundays. I would be quite happy to provide those photographs free of charge because over the course of this particular session we have lacked the opportunity to talk realistically about the good things that Australia offers.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), said earlier, the opposition is not opposing this bill. However, I do have some concerns about increasing charges on an industry that has been singularly successful in helping this country to trade some of the way out of its present problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the run-up to the 13 March election, the government indicated that it would not increase taxes. The travelling public must have been quite dismayed when it saw the departure tax increased in the budget. I hope that the pain that will be inflicted on the tourist industry will indeed be worth the relatively small amount of increased revenue which the government will reap as a result of the departure tax increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should consider whether the departure tax imposed by this country is equitable when compared to departure taxes or other taxes imposed on travellers in other parts of the world. After all, while we on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland and in the area represented by my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) have a lot to offer the travelling public, a lot to offer the tourist, we should remember that we are in a world market and that we should not at any time leave ourselves open to pricing ourselves out of the marketplace. Going to any travel agency, one finds that there are very many desirable places competing for the tourist dollar.

While some people might say that a relatively small increase in the departure tax will not deter people from visiting us&mdash;I certainly hope that is the case&mdash;one should be concerned by the fact that any increase in the departure tax is being imposed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I pay tribute to the Meals on Wheels organisation and to the dedicated volunteers who put so much effort into making that organisation such a success. Meals on Wheels has the largest voluntary work force of any voluntary organisation in Australia. There is no doubt that Meals on Wheels plays a central role in developing a sense of community and ending the isolation experienced by many older people in our community. Through the provision of nutritious meals, particularly to older citizens but also to the disabled, Meals on Wheels provides a valuable service to many in our community who cannot necessarily provide for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Volunteers working for the Meals on Wheels service do so through a sense of personal reward. This evening I pay tribute to some of those volunteers who work with the Meals on Wheels organisations in the electorate of Lilley. In particular, I mention some people associated with the Burnie Brae centre at Chermside. These dedicated people include Pauline Maidment, Daphne Lammas, Val Yarrow, Thelma Aitken, George Barker and Dulcie Gardner. Voluntary workers at other centres include: at Geebung, Joan Crompton, Denise Griffiths, Pat McDonald, Kevin Gay, Claire Brown, Robin Britain and Jean Rogers; at Nudgee, Jim Kelly, Kath Chappel and Lyn Cosgrove; at Nundah, Edna Cramb, Connie Raabe, Alec Madden and Norm Rees; at Windsor, Betty Hamlyn-Harris, Donald Crombie, Colleen Bonney, Heather Buhse, Mrs Straker, Debbie Connell, Susie Stevens-Hoare, Bett Tipper, Iris Barnett, Robin Kerr, Cheryl Anderson and Bill Walsh; and, at Sandgate, Harold Roberts, George Hancox, Gerry Escott, Ivy Braiden, Ernie Braiden, Doug Sheapher and Nell Jones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This voluntary work force in Meals on Wheels is, as I said before, one of the largest voluntary work forces in the country. Recently, the caucus employment task force brought down its report. It recommended a significant increase in voluntary work options in this community. I believe that Meals on Wheels is one of those organisations for which the Commonwealth could provide a significant voluntary work effort to assist the community. Voluntary work in organisations such as Meals on Wheels would be one pathway back into employment, particularly for the long-term unemployed. I envisage that, if such a program were to be implemented, as recommended in the caucus task force report, the Commonwealth could provide significant infrastructure funding to groups such as Meals on Wheels to allow the unemployed to participate and give something back to the community within which they live. Meals on Wheels is a very important organisation. It relies upon unpaid labour. It is deserving of community and governmental support and it is important that, in accord with the findings of the caucus employment task force, that support be provided through the participation of the unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As change appears to be squarely on the government's agenda, it is an appropriate time to raise an issue which, unlike our constitution and flag, actually does require change. Unfortunately, there is no choice to vote or not to vote. It is time that we caught up with the rest of the world. Australia is the only English-speaking nation and the only Westminster democracy to enforce compulsory voting. While I steadfastly and very strongly support a person's right to vote, it is the antithesis of democracy to compel people to exercise their rights. People should have the right to vote or not to vote. Compulsory voting is a farce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Introduced in 1924 for the upcoming federal elections, compulsory voting has, by default, become an accepted fact of Australian politics. There should be debate in all parties about the merits and disadvantages of this policy. In the early part of this century a drop in voter turnout at one election was assumed to be sufficient justification for the imposition of compulsory voting. It should be noted for the record that that particular election fell on the Saturday before Christmas, when voter turnout would naturally have been down. The private member's bill which ended voluntary voting for federal elections passed both Houses without a division after less than 2 1/2 hours debate&mdash;not very much consideration for such a measure. In the House the then honourable member for Boothby, Mr Duncan-Hughes, spoke against the proposal, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regret the haste with which this bill has been introduced. Compulsory voting was not advocated by me when contesting the last election. There may be good reasons for the reduction in the number of persons who voted&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>at the election in question&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but that falling off does not, of itself, justify this House in making such a radical alteration of the electoral laws of the Commonwealth as this bill proposes. It is said that a man cannot be made moral by an act of parliament. It is certain that a man cannot be compelled to take an interest in political affairs if he does not want to do so.</PARA>
<PARA>Under our current system Australians are forced to turn up at the polling booth. It has not been proven that this serves any good purpose. It simply increases the proportion of votes cast thoughtlessly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compulsory voting has undesirable effects on the quality of participation in political life. It helps to make political parties lazy between elections. It encourages last-minute saturation advertising campaigns and, as such, increases the likelihood of voters being misled by false promises. The mere mention of voluntary voting arouses suspicion, knee-jerk reactions and emotive rhetoric. There is, however, no evidence to indicate that voluntary voting would favour one side of politics in particular. It would simply be returning liberty to the individual. This is a matter which all parties should consider very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Voluntary voting has many benefits. Voting turnouts tend to be much higher in marginal electorates than in safe ones. Voluntary voting, therefore, appears to make it harder for incumbents to take their seats for granted. It promotes increased community involvement in politics and elections due to the fact that potential voters have to be encouraged to go out and cast their votes. Australians deserve the freedom to make their own choice about voting. This issue should and must be on the agenda. I hope that the government looks at it fairly and squarely. It certainly, at the very least, deserves open debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So often, when voluntary voting is mentioned, the American example is cited with predictions that voter turnout would decline so dramatically that governments would be decided by a minority. It is misleading to draw a comparison between the United States and Australia. For a start, electoral enrolment is optional in the USA. The rules of eligibility for enrolment vary widely from state to state. Voter fatigue is alive and well in the USA. On top of the range of elections for the three levels of government with which we are familiar, there are any number of contests for the position of judge, sheriff and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under these circumstances the ballot box will lose appeal. In any event, I believe that we should maintain compulsory enrolment, unlike the United States, but have voluntary voting. It is more appropriate to compare Australia with other countries that share our common law heritage and system of government. New Zealand averages a turnout rate of around 88 per cent without the imposition of compulsory voting. In the United Kingdom and Canada the turnout usually exceeds 75 per cent. I suggest that, while compulsory voting may be part of Australia's past since 1924, it should not be part of its future. I implore the government to look at this proposal. It is a positive reform measure, requiring proper consideration. It is a measure which involves the liberty of the individual and fairness. </PARA>

If we live in a country, we should have the responsibility to have some say in its government. The point that I would like to bring to the attention of the House is an 1837 report of a Select Committee on Aborigines in the British Settlements reported to the House of Commons. As recorded by the House, the report stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the intercourse of Europeans in general without any exception in favour of the subjects of Great Britain, has been, unless when attended by missionary exertions, a source of many calamities to uncivilised nations. Too often, their territory has been usurped; their property seized; their numbers diminished; their character debased; the spread of civilisation impeded. European vices and diseases have been introduced amongst them, and they have been familiarised with the use of our most potent instruments for the subtle or the violent destruction of human life, viz. brandy and gunpowder . . . . It might be presumed that the native inhabitants of any land have an incontrovertible right to their own soil; a plain and sacred right, however, which seems not to have been understood. Europeans have entered their borders uninvited, and, when there, have not only acted as if they were undoubted lords of the soil, but have punished the natives as aggressors if they have evinced a disposition to live in their own country . . . . If they have been found upon their own property, they have been treated as thieves and robbers. They are driven back into the interior as if they were dogs or kangaroos. From very large tracts we have, it appears, succeeded in eradicating them; and though from some parts their ejection has not been so apparently violent as from others, it has been equally complete, through our taking possession of their hunting-grounds, whereby we have despoiled them of the means of existence'. The committee gave particular attention to the Aborigines in the Australian colonies and the weight of the evidence it obtained constituted one of the most condemning indictments of genocide in the nineteenth century.</PARA>

I ask them to look at this 1837 report. When those opposite express their well-considered opinions, when they stand before this House and make their opinions known, when they have the legislation in front of them and make their position known, I ask them to look at the real history. I ask them to look at what has really happened to our indigenous Australians and to have some compassion, some foresight, to have the courage of their convictions and do the honourable thing, and that is to acknowledge what has taken place in the past. </PARA>

Mr Terry Wigley is an $8,000 per year disability pensioner who has been ordered to pay his estranged wife $50 a week child maintenance. His wife is a nursing sister&mdash;a deputy director of nursing, in fact&mdash;earning $42,000 per year. She owns an $80,000 home. She was also granted legal aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Wigley has a loving relationship with his 14-year-old son whom he willingly clothes, accommodates, feeds and entertains for 30 per cent of the year&mdash;all on an $8,000 single man's disability pension. He is currently in arrears of more than $1,000 with the Child Support Agency and faces arrest for non-compliance. He was in hiding until two weeks ago when he was hospitalised suffering bronchial pneumonia, severe and chronic diabetes, angina and low-grade quadriplegia. He is out now, back in hiding, but continues to suffer two serious angina attacks per week and faces the possibility of amputation of his feet due to the complications of his diabetes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Wigley's application for legal aid was refused, both initially and on reconsideration, on the basis of `the limited funding available to the Commission for the provision of legal aid, and because of the greater needs of other applicants'. Could a deputy director of nursing on $42,000 have greater needs than a physically and almost mentally wrecked man on $8,000 per year? She was granted legal aid. I am numbed by the sheer stupidity of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission has ignored a request for a meeting with Mr Wigley, his social worker and a member of my staff. Now, with the approval and endorsement of the commission, it has hit him with a bill for $7,871.38 for services rendered by various legal firms four to six years ago in a workers compensation matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the Western Australian Legal Aid Commission has little or no regard to Mr Wigley's life threatening health predicament. The undeclared war it has waged on a sick man&mdash;hounding him for money he does not have, and denying him representation&mdash;will almost certainly end up with him in the grave. Each time his social worker rings my office, I fear it is to tell me of his death. The attitude of the commission's review committee flabbergasts me. It would only need to take one look at the man to see that he desperately needs help. What does the committee say when I ask it to look for some compassionate grounds? I am told, `The decision of the review committee is final. I am not in a position to reassess Mr Wigley's application to appeal against the magistrate's decision'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the commission proceeded to place a mortgage on Mr Wigley's home, of which he only owns a small portion. Mr Wigley's health problems are directly related to the stress caused by this tragic case, which should not have arisen in the first place. The immense and unjustifiable hardship caused to this man by this group of faceless, inhuman robots is unforgivable and, may I say, totally un-Australian. In the light of his encounters with the commission, the lack of assistance, the possible victimisation and the undeniable deficiency in compassion, it could be legitimately argued that Mr Wigley is being seriously disadvantaged and discriminated against by members of the Western Australian Legal Aid Commission under sections 40 and 42(i) of the Disability Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the hope that justice and equity prevail in this nation, I ask the Western Australian Legal Aid Commission to look positively at the merits of Mr Wigley's case and, in particular, at his impoverished health and dire financial situation. I ask them to determine that the costs against him be set aside. Such a decision would be in keeping with the principles set down by the Western Australian State Disability Services Act 1992 and the Commonwealth Discrimination Act 1992. It would also be in keeping with the Australian principle of a fair go. I ask the commission to demonstrate that it is prepared to take an active role in maintaining the rights of people with disabilities, such as Mr Wigley, who are often disadvantaged both financially and physically, and who are consequently placed in positions of double jeopardy. </PARA>

I guess that there are many other `nashos' who are unaware of this. In fact, approximately 220,000 young men served their country in that way in that unique chapter in Australia's defence history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We knew exactly what it was like to serve in the forces&mdash;the short-arm parades, the latrine duty, the compulsory injections every Friday night for every known disease and some that were unknown, the bromide in our tea that did not work, and, of course, the first weekend's leave after eight weeks. The attitudes to our peacekeeping role have changed since then, but in March 1951 national service was introduced in an atmosphere of fear about the growth of communist influences throughout the world and the Menzies government's belief that large-scale deployment of troops could still be a prime factor in many contingencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP conference voted by a small majority in favour of the scheme. So all young men aged 18 years were required to register and, if fit, undertake training for 176 days in one of the military services. A review of the scheme in 1953 produced certain changes. Army training was reduced to 140 days and navy and air force training to 154 days. Trainees had free choice of a branch of the service, but volunteered to serve overseas as required if in the navy or air force. National service training continued to operate in this form until April 1957 when the government came to the conclusion that the maintenance of a large reservoir of partially trained young men was no longer essential to Australia's military defence needs. The Regular Army was reorganised and increased its intake and the national service intake fell from an average of about 33,000 to one of 12,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National service training for the navy and air force was discontinued. Trainees were then determined by a ballot system based on birth dates. Actually, I am sure this appealed to the Australian gambling streak. So if 18 December, for example, came up, as it did for me, one reported to the nearest army headquarters and then went off to Wacol, Ingleburn, Puckapunyal or wherever, and underwent basic military training with the officers of the Regular Army. The government finally suspended the scheme completely in 1959. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to bring to the attention of the House this evening the fact that former national service trainees of that unique period in Australia's history are not only eligible to join the RSL, that great organisation of volunteers, but they would be welcomed for their input of fresh ideas and youth. Whether or not we believe in the political attitudes of the RSL, there is no doubt that the organisation is of enormous value to many people in our community. Unfortunately, it is an ageing organisation. I make this speech to reach many of those `nashos' so that they, too, can serve the community in which they live. I am sure the RSL will reflect this in its continuing spirit of commitment to all communities. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment that was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> this week adds a new dimension to the problems which Australian science is now facing. The minister confessed to a visiting group of science students that he was sick and tired of going to meetings of scientists. He said to the students that he found the scientists were all grey-haired men in cardigans and that he found these meetings boring. He said it was a bit boring to have to go along to these meetings of elderly scientists in cardigans and he was sick and tired of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attack on Australian scientists is absolutely intolerable. The minister quite rightly was rebuked by the government's own former chief scientist, Professor Ralph Slatyer, who made a stinging comment on these remarks when he pointed out that, to the extent that there was an increasing number of older people undertaking scientific research in Australia's universities and in the CSIRO, this was largely a result of the cutbacks that have occurred in science funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, of course, as all involved in Australian science would know, by taking funding out of the universities through these cutbacks and putting it into the Australian Research Council, the universities have been deprived of funds vital to bringing on younger graduates and giving them a chance to cut their teeth on research within the universities. These are people who would not be eligible and would not be able to obtain competitive research grants from the ARC but who, in the past, were brought into Australian science through funds that were available to the universities and which have now been removed from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, to the extent that this greying of Australian science is a reality, it is entirely a function of the government's policies on science. The government has allowed the problem to degenerate to the extent that the CSIRO now believes that half of its research staff will have reached retirement age by the year 2000. Not only is the age distribution in the nation's research institutions skewed towards older research staff, but these institutions have insufficient funds to recruit young people and, as a result, the attractiveness of careers in areas such as science, engineering and technology has declined relative to other professions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Australian science needs is a minister with vision and, above all, a minister with an interest in science. We know that this minister is interested in the leadership of the Australian Labor Party because he was the numbers man for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). We know that he is interested in the upheaval of Australia's constitution because it was he who moved the resolution at the ALP conference in Hobart that Australia should become a republic. But what still needs to be demonstrated is that the person responsible for the government science policy has an interest in science. He should be prepared to talk to and consult with scientists. He should stop abusing and demoralising them. He should also stop disabusing young people of the view that there is a decent career for them in science, because there will not be as long as this present approach to Australian science continues. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has not, to date, made any statement formally declaring recognition of the remaining states referred to in Part 2 above. In the absence of an express statement of recognition, Australia cannot be taken to have recognised a state by implication arising out of any other act or statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) Recognition practices of states differ greatly. A number of states follow a practice of not making formal statements of recognition, and instead assert that recognition must be inferred from the level and nature of their dealings with other states. For example, many of these states would assert that their co-sponsorship, or vote in favour, of a General Assembly resolution admitting another state to the United Nations constitutes their recognition of that state. On the other hand, other states, including Australia, follow a practice of making express statements of recognition, and, in the absence of a statement, their recognition cannot be inferred from any other act or statement. Thus it is not possible to say with certainty when, or indeed whether, a particular state has been recognised by other states before Australia, except by examining every other state's relationship with the state in question. Even then, it may not be possible to obtain a conclusive affirmation.</PARA>
