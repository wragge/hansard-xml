<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>It is appropriate that the last thing this parliament does on this last sitting day of the International Year for the World's Indigenous People is to pass this Native Title Bill. It is appropriate that, in the passing of it, this parliament this day will do more, and will have done more, to return to the Aboriginal people of this country their own soil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Chairman, just on a year ago I launched the International Year for the World's Indigenous People at Redfern. During that speech I raised the opportunity presented by the High Court's decision in the Mabo case and reiterated my view that this presented a huge opportunity for Australia; that here we had a basis for reconciliation formerly denied us but that we had to seize the opportunity and build a body of social, property and administrative law around the High Court decision which would then provide a basis in land for indigenous Australians to participate more fully in this society, and to do something real and material about a genuine basis of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it happens the government campaigned on this issue, among others, in the election campaign. It won the election and then it set about systematically developing the lines of logic and principle that ought to lie behind a comprehensive piece of social and property legislation like this when it is brought to the parliament. It has probably been the most worked over piece of legislation in the 11-year history of the Labor government, and it saw the devotion of more ministerial and bureaucratic time than any other piece of legislation in the period. Also there was a round of consultations with the various stakeholders and interested parties&mdash;most particularly the Aboriginal people, for whom the bill was designed, but also the states, the farmers and graziers, the mining industry, and all of the other groups that have an interest in Aboriginal policy and who are interested in development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has sought to meet the twin goals of justice for Aboriginal people and the establishment of a workable system of land management. This the bill does. It gives to Aboriginal people the right to have claims for native title heard and awarded in a stream of the Federal Court of Australia and in the state supreme courts, and it gives to the states and state institutions the power to make economic decisions over native title land. We believe that these mechanisms will serve the country well in allowing the great rural and mining industries of this country to grow and prosper while at the same time maintaining a position of harmony with the interests of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lesson of Mabo is that we should never underestimate our capacities for solving our problems. We should take this legislation to be a victory for all Australians and the Australian nation because it is a profound event. It should mark a new spirit of faith and optimism in Australia that something of this complexity can in fact be mastered and agreed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between the opposition and the Labor government is on this subject, as it has always been&mdash;Mabo has made this clear: the opposition represents the politics of pessimism and despair; we say there is every reason to be optimistic. The opposition presumes ill will among Australians; we presume goodwill. The opposition can only talk of national disaster; we talk of national success. The opposition believes in property rights only for some; we believe in property rights for all, including indigenous Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might be tempted to dwell on the abysmal role that the opposition has played in this debate, for never has a political opposition exhibited less vision, less principle or less faith in the people of Australia and their democratic institutions. Never has an opposition shown less leadership or been so badly led. But this is not a day for political retribution. I dare say, Mr Chairman, in due course, the Australian people will make their judgment on the opposition's dismal role in this great national achievement, as the Liberal Party, no doubt, will soon make its judgment on the dismal role of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a day to celebrate the powerful, creative forces which conceived and brought to fruition this historic legislation. I mean those people and their organisations who imagined there might be a solution to the problem and who had the strength of will, the determination to succeed, the intelligence to negotiate and to argue the case, and the good feelings towards one another to make sure their hopes were realised. This was displayed across the political system and the social fabric of the country&mdash;bar the opposition. So this is very much a day for indigenous Australians to celebrate and, indeed, for us all to celebrate the strength of the Aboriginal people and the capacity of our democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You were going to wipe out native title. That is how much you were going to put in to end the lie. The beginning is, as I said, a basis for social justice and reconciliation. In the bill the government has made provision for the acquiring of pastoral leases and their conversion to native title. The government will be introducing a social justice package next year amongst which we will have a land acquisition fund, the purpose of which will be to allow Aboriginal people to buy pastoral leases and to convert them into a native title. Of course, that land will attach all the negotiating rights which obtain with native title land under the bill. This will mean that Aboriginal people will not only simply acquire a pastoral lease which is no more than simply a pastoral lease but underneath that pastoral lease will then sit a native title.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the National Party talks about the mining industry. The mining industry will have no problems with this legislation. There is a process of negotiation with a relatively tight timetabling. In the event that people cannot agree, that is, the proponents of economic proposals and Aboriginal people, they will be heard by an arbitral tribunal. That tribunal will decide whether development will proceed or not. In the event that a state government or a state minister believes a certain development should proceed, that development can proceed with a very clear override provision by states, for states, in the legislation. But, of course, that is for development. In terms of the validation of past titles, the bill validates the titles issued after the Racial Discrimination Act was introduced in 1975 and makes clear that those titles issued between 1975 and 1992 are valid.</PARA></TALK.START>

That amendment adds a new clause 6A to the bill to make it clear that validation for past acts can proceed free from any possibility of conflict with the RDA, but making it clear that the future processes set out in the bill are subject to the RDA.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to recommendations by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the government proposed amendments to provide for a parliamentary joint committee to monitor and review the operations of this bill. This is a unique piece of legislation and a formal monitoring mechanism seems appropriate. There was also an amendment to provide for the Aboriginal Social Justice Commissioner to provide a yearly report on the operations of the act and its effect on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There were also amendments to provide for the renewal of existing valid leases. These amendments were not the government's preferred option for dealing with this issue but, in the absence of any support from the opposition, there was a need for a compromise. The amendments, we believe, are workable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After negotiations with the minor parties and Aboriginal representatives, the government agreed to sponsor a package of amendments relating to bodies corporate under which the original provisions would have held native title on behalf of the native title holders. As a result of the amendments, the native title holders can now choose whether or not a body corporate will hold the rights on their behalf. There will still be a body corporate which will act as a representative body for native title holders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill went to the Senate with very clear principles and very clear logic to it. In the course of the Senate debate the government has accepted the amendments I mentioned and some other amendments which we think strengthen the bill&mdash;a consequence of the whole debate which saw, firstly, the presentation of a discussion paper by the government just after mid-year. Then consultations followed with the Aboriginal community and with the various stakeholders and the states saw the presentation of a draft bill. The draft bill was then circulated for comment. We took the comments on board from the states, the mining industry, the farming and grazing communities and the National Farmers Federation. We took those to cabinet and amended the bill as we thought it should be and then produced a bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first writing of the drafts of the bill was again circulated. We had feedback on those drafts and some of that was incorporated in the legislation. We went on to produce the bill and introduced it into this parliament. In the course of its passing this House and the Senate there were further discussions and negotiations, and these amendments are the result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably the most negotiated bill that has been through the parliament&mdash;certainly in the last 10 years&mdash;and the consultations have been broader than has been the case for any other piece of legislation. There has been a very long debate in the parliament on the bill. As a consequence, we think now we are at the point where the bill with the amendments needs to be agreed to by the House of Representatives, having been agreed to by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wind up by again putting on the record my thanks to those people who participated generously in the debate. I want to again, as I have done publicly, reiterate my appreciation to Ms Lois O'Donoghue, the Chairperson of ATSIC, for agreeing to negotiate with the government, to lead her community and to lead ATSIC towards the negotiation table. It was that primary negotiation within which the interests of Aboriginal people were considered. Subsequently, that brought in wider support in the Aboriginal community. As a consequence, I think now most members of the Aboriginal community have confidence in the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also place on record my appreciation for the valiant job Senator Gareth Evans did in the Senate in arguing the intellectual case against such provocation by the coalition for over 40 hours of debate. His triumph in the intellectual argument ensured that the bill withstood any scrutiny. All of these people were key to the bill succeeding. Again, let me reiterate that the Aboriginal community, the so-called `A team'&mdash;Ms Lois O'Donoghue and her group, Mr Noel Pearson, Mr David Ross and others&mdash;were a key to keeping Aboriginal support and arguing the amendments through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had hoped that the opposition would support the legislation; that after 18 months it would have come to a position on Mabo. In the end, the opposition's position was that it did not want to give Aboriginal people an inherent right to land. In the end, the opposition openly lined up with and supported the Western Australian government which sought to extinguish native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition went around the Aboriginal communities of this country to listen to what they said. He saw them but he did not listen and, as a consequence, he came up not with a policy but with simply an obstructionist view that the government's legislation ought to fail and deserved no support. The Liberal Party and the National Party have lost a great opportunity to return to the mainstream of Australian life and Australian society. That is their decision. But there has been a total absence of leadership on this, a marginalising of the coalition and a total failure on its part to alter the course of the legislation or to have any real impact on the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition vested everything in the notion that native title ought to be extinguished and that state parliaments ought to be able to hand out a statutory title conferred on Aboriginal people at the whim and caprice of ministers. In other words, the coalition decided to wipe out any proprietary right to inherent title. In the end, the duplicity of the coalition is highlighted by the fact that it believes in the rule of law except when the High Court says something it does not like. The coalition claims that it believes in private property&mdash;except the private property rights of native people, of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This humbug and hypocrisy in the debate will condemn the opposition for not standing and supporting the rule of law when, in this case, the highest court in the land, the most supreme of our courts, made a decision. Later, we will hear the Leader of the Opposition say that he supported the High Court decision; but he immediately wanted to wipe it out. He supported native title but then wanted to extinguish it. He also wanted to deny Aboriginal people proprietary title, to give them no proprietary rights but simply a set of rights which were not to be defined and which could be tested only in a dispute. And the coalition is talking about the amount of land which will be alienated from Australia, as if native title in some way will remove the land and the pastoralists from this continent. It is a pity that there was no leadership by the opposition and that, as a consequence, the bill did not enjoy bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great joy is that the bill succeeded. We on this side of the chamber rejoice in its sentiments and what it will do to empower Aboriginal people and to give them a stake in Australian life and Australian society which they have not until this time generally had.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said yesterday, this is a day of shame for Australia that will haunt the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his government every hour of every day between now and the next election. The Prime Minister stood up here and put his hand over his heart, claiming to represent the interests of Australians in general and Aboriginal Australians in particular. He then set out to exploit the politics of this issue through the essence of his comments this morning. It was a classic piece of Keating hypocrisy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best way to encapsulate what has been done with this piece of legislation is to recognise that it is simply a deal and, as deals go&mdash;and this takes some doing&mdash;this is the new low watermark of deal making in this country. It was a deal stitched up between a weak Prime Minister, some Aboriginal leaders, one pastoralist and the minority parties in the Senate. In doing that deal, the Prime Minister sold out all Australians and the interests of all Australians. It was nothing more than a deal, stitched together for political ends. It reveals how far the Prime Minister will capitulate to the left wing of his own party in order to save his political hide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most offensive elements of this debate is this tendency on the part of the government, particularly the Prime Minister, to argue the case that if people do not support this bill they are bigots, racists or un-Australian&mdash;that if people do not support this bill they do not have a commitment to justice, dignity and self-respect for the Aboriginal people. That should be seen for what it is: total humbug and total hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has tried to equate support for this bill with a commitment to justice, dignity and self-respect for the Aboriginal people, which it is not. We are absolutely committed to justice for Aboriginal people. We are absolutely committed to the dignity of the Aboriginal people. We are absolutely committed to self-respect for the Aboriginal people; but we can dissociate ourselves from this monstrous piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are proud to stand up here on behalf of all Australians and dissociate ourselves from this piece of legislation. We will have this debate every day, as I say, between now and the next election. The fact is that he has sold out the interests of the people of Australia, including Aboriginal Australians, for the sake of this tawdry deal. And that is what will go down in history as a result of this process. It is not a watershed, it is not a turning point for the benefit of all Australians but a turning point to the detriment of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a very simple proposition put before us by the High Court's decision, and that was to recognise native title. The challenge was to codify or deal with native title in a way that was fair not only to Aboriginal Australians but to our great mining and pastoral industries and to all other Australians as well. It was a very simple issue. He did not need to take the decision he has taken and to build the paraphernalia he has built of tribunals, registrars and assessors that goes way beyond the intent of the High Court decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill could easily have satisfied that basic requirement, but it failed to do so. The essence, therefore, of our opposition to this bill is that it clearly fails in its central purpose. It does not ensure that all Australians are treated equally under the law. It does not address the real concerns and the aspirations of Aboriginal and Islander people&mdash;things like their health, their living conditions and their education&mdash;or the issue of the recognition of their culture and heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does not guarantee security of title or remove the uncertainty that has arisen. Farmers are still going to end up in court, for example. Its massive complexity will ensure that investment will be discouraged, jobs will be lost and national development projects will be held up&mdash;to the detriment of all Australians.

It is all part of more power for Keating at the expense of the states. We are prepared to stand up for the constitution and ensure that the states continue to maintain that responsibility for land management in Australia.

He stands up here and put his hand over his heart and says he is standing up for Aboriginal people when he is in fact selling out the interests of Aboriginal people.

He has already heard major miners in this country saying that they will move their exploration activity offshore. One major miner has already told me that, as a result of this legislation, he does not believe he will see another new mine open in Australia.

As we made the point last week, he has now embraced something of an imperial or regal lifestyle which is totally divorced from what those true believers he claims to represent can identify with. He stands up in this place and elsewhere in Australia, puts his hand over his heart, says he stands by Chifley and other Labor leaders of the past, mouths the rhetoric of Chifley and then goes out and lives a lifestyle and pursues interests that are totally divorced from the lifestyle and interests of the people he claims to represent, and people out there see this Mabo legislation as part of that pattern. </PARA>

Perhaps most disturbing is that a lot of Aboriginal people woke up this morning knowing that they will get nothing directly out of this.

They cannot understand why their job opportunities are so much more restricted, or why it is so much harder for their kids to get a job or to get an education, or why their mortality rates are so far out of line with the rest of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the government has accepted the amendments in relation to the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill. The first matter relates to the mature age allowance. In my view the amendments are quite sensible because they ensure that people who receive a mature age allowance and undertake part-time work will be able, if they lose that work, to go back on the mature age allowance rather than having to receive other forms of benefit that are available to the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the compensation recovery arrangements, the opposition has agreed to the majority of the provisions that the government has sought to enact. But we have moved to delete from the bill those compensation measures which deal with the question of excluding from benefits those who receive a compensation payment to replace lost income or future income earning capacity. We wanted to do so because the particular measure, as it is intended to operate, will characterise all compensation payments as 50 per cent economic loss related. The impact of such a provision would be that a beneficiary might</PARA>
<PARA>suffer a significant preclusion period as a result of the compensation being characterised as 50 per cent for economic loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That could mean, for instance, that an invalid or age pensioner who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and received a small compensation payment for pain and suffering or out of pocket medical expenses would have part of that payment characterised as 50 per cent economic loss related. There would be a preclusion period for that person being able then to obtain social security benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there are discretionary provisions in the existing law which allow the government to make a decision to grant a person an ex gratia payment, the fact is that the way in which those provisions have been construed&mdash;this has been confirmed by the courts&mdash;has meant that a person would not be able to get the discretion exercised that is available unless there were new guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government tells us that the guidelines are very complex and difficult to draft. I do not believe it is beyond the wit of parliamentary counsel to come up with appropriate guidelines for advising officers on the exercise of a discretion. If the government is given time, it will come up with an appropriate set of guidelines for implementation of the discretion. So, for that reason, we have deleted all of the provisions at this time; but, if the government brings back fresh provisions along with appropriate guidelines for administering discretion, obviously we will be prepared to look at this measure again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the movement of 16-year-olds from Austudy to family payments, the opposition took the view that this measure would have quite a significant impact, particularly on families, because the measure was designed to save the government money, which it can do only by reducing the support available. It does this by applying different assets and income tests. Our view is that the measure would disadvantage families, particularly rural families. We opposed it and we are pleased that the other parties, the Australian Democrats in particular, joined us in opposing that particular measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter relates to data matching. The government sought removal of the sunset clause that brought data matching to an end. We would have been prepared to look at these provisions more realistically if the government had been able to produce evidence that data matching was achieving the outcomes originally foreshadowed. The government expected savings of the order of $300 million from data matching. In the end, in net terms, a mere $3 million saving has been demonstrated in the most recent reports of the Auditor-General who has examined this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this time it is appropriate to deal with the data matching by ensuring that the sunset clause presently in place&mdash;which would have seen the provisions expire on 22 January 1994&mdash;remains in place but with the substitution of a new sunset date of 22 January 1996. This is an appropriate response which gives the government flexibility in future years to move in relation to this matter. But it ensures continuing reports on the adequacy of the data matching regime and it leaves open the option of having the sunset clause operate if it is demonstrated that the data matching has not realised the objectives set for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have already wasted one minute. I briefly wanted to address clauses 88 and 89 of the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill because what the government originally intended to do would have had a detrimental effect on some 136,000 students and their families in Australia, and particularly those in regional and rural Australia. It would have halved the assets test that applied to these payments, from some $730,000 to $360,000; reduced the maximum income from some $30,000 to $24,000; and reduced the maximum payment from $129 a fortnight to $121 a fortnight. This was in light of the government's own policy statement that it would `make continuing improvements to the Austudy schemes of student support'. This was not an improvement. It was clearly detrimental to the interests of a whole range of families, particularly in regional and rural Australia. In a week in which the government brings out a report on trying to maximise and improve opportunities for regional Australia, this provision stood in marked contrast. So we on this side are glad the government has finally seen the light on these measures.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments to the Social Security Amendment Bill (No.2) attempt to bring student parents' income for testing purposes for family payments into line with the tests that apply to all others. Unfortunately, the government did not take into account that some people had planned on receiving incomes which included postgraduate awards which, if this test had applied, would have excluded a number of people from receiving family payments even though they had included that very carefully in their budgeting. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that this provision has no retrospective application. We think it is a sensible measure and support it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 54.1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enactment of uniform legislation throughout Australia to regulate the acquisition and possession of firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power to regulate the acquisition and possession of firearms lies with the States and Territories. At the Premiers meeting on 22 December 1987 all jurisdictions, with the exception of Tasmania, requested the Australian Police Ministers Council (APMC) to give further consideration to a number of issues related to gun control. A special meeting of the APMC was held in March 1988. Although the meeting passed a number of resolutions aimed at controlling the ownership and use of firearms, progress towards achieving uniformity of approach between jurisdictions has proved difficult. It has proved impossible to achieve the broad agreement which the Commonwealth regards as essential to the effectiveness of legislation in all jurisdictions. However, the Commonwealth is committed to continuing to work through the APMC to encourage the further development of a national approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 23 October 1991 the Australian Police Ministers Council adopted a set of resolutions to be used by each jurisdiction as a basis to reform guns laws across Australia. On 22 November 1991 a Meeting of Premiers and Chief Ministers decided to implement the positive steps taken by the Police Ministers at their October meeting and indicated their full support for the principles agreed to by the Police Ministers, as a guide to the reform of the gun laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW Government acted quickly on this matter. It drew on the resolutions of the APMC, and on the recommendations of the NSW Joint Parliamentary Committee Upon Gun Law Reform, to formulate new gun laws for NSW. These new laws came into effect on 1 May 1992, within the target date of 1 July 1992 proposed by the Police Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A special booklet, entitled `New Firearms and Domestic Violence Legislation', was issued by the NSW Police Service on 27 April 1992 to inform police and the general public of the new legislation. In addition, the Police Service conducted special training courses for its officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These recommendations relate to the proposed development of uniform gun control legislation, enforcement and strategies throughout Australia. The stated aims are not inconsistent with those of the Victorian Firearms Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of uniform gun control legislation should be the subject of a future agreement between State and Territory Ministers. It is probable that the existing Victorian Firearms Act 1958 will comply with most section of such an agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Queensland Government has introduced the Weapons Act 1990. This legislation allows for the licensing of all firearm users. The Act fully implements current Queensland Government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1993:  No change recorded</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Western Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A committee has been formed to establish uniform legislation in regards to firearm possession and guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Police Department concurs with this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania is a full member of the Australian Police Ministers' Council (APMC) and is therefore substantially bound by Council's decisions. Tasmania has always had strict control in relation to firearms and pistols. The Guns Act 1991 broadens these controls to all types of firearms. This Act requires persons using/possessing firearms to be licensed (photographic licence) to do so. Tasmania departed from Commonwealth recommendations in electing to register the owner of a firearm(s) rather than each firearm itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Northern Territory</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Previous attempts at uniformity have failed. Northern Territory Police, after extensive consultations with the Territory Sporting Shooters' Council prepared a Firearms Bill which represents the most acceptable compromise in meeting the needs of the whole Northern Territory community in regard to gun control. The Act will commence on 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 54.2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction, through the Australian Police Ministers Council, of uniform guidelines for all Australian police forces in the enforcement of firearms legislation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Police Ministers Council is to discuss this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1993:  no change recorded</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Western Australia</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NSW's new gun laws, which became effective from 1 May 1992, require:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation relates to the development of a uniform gun control strategy aimed at reducing the number of firearms in the community and preventing access by unsuitable persons to such weapons. The Firearms Act 1958 is not inconsistent with those objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Refer also to response to Recommendation 54.1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The APMC has already resolved for such a strategy. The Weapons Act is aimed at reducing the numbers of firearms in Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1993:  no change recorded</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Police Department concurs with this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy of Tasmania Police is to restrict the number of firearms in the community. Guide-lines exist that establish strict requirements whereby the Commissioner of  Police has to be satisfied that potential owners are fit and proper persons to hold a firearms licence. Our new domestic violence legislation also makes provision for police to seize firearms in potentially threatening domestic situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Northern Territory</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present NT Firearms Act provides that a person convicted of a firearms offence, is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) not eligible to be licensed;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) may have his/her licence revoked by Commissioner; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) may be disqualified by court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the new Firearms Act does not expressly deal with persons `convicted of violent crime or who have demonstrated a propensity for violence', although the Commissioner of Police does have to be satisfied that a person is `fit and proper' to have a firearms licence. This interacts to some extent with Domestic Violence Legislation, in so far as it refers to `demonstrated propensity':  a person the subject of a domestic violence restraining order could be viewed as a person having demonstrated a propensity for violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Capital Territory</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACT Government supports these recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACT Legislative Assembly has recently enacted the Weapons Act 1991 which seeks to give effect to the recommendations of the National Committee on Violence to the greatest extent possible.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACT Weapons Act 1991 seeks to give effect to the recommendations of the National Committee on Violence to the greatest possible extent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends the following specific strategies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 55.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government should undertake the following action:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 55.1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Military weapons:  sales of surplus military weapons should be prohibited to prevent their use in Australia. The importation of military-style weapons for use other than by law enforcement officers or defence force personnel should be prohibited. The Federal Government should provide a general statement to specify what firearms are importable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth supports limitations on the public availability of firearms in order to minimise death or  injury from their misuse. It has announced strict controls on the disposal of surplus military weapons and  a ban on sales of semi-automatic firearms to members of the public from the Small Arms Factory, Lithgow;  although the Factory will continue to supply parts to bona-fide customers consistent with current State and Territory gun legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Defence is responsible for the disposal of working weapon systems, military platforms and warlike stores. In almost all cases the Department of Administrative Services, through the Commonwealth Government Sales Agency, Aussales, manages the sale of surplus military weapons of historical value or with civilian equivalents. Neither Department supports a complete ban on the sale of surplus military weapons. Current Commonwealth policy makes provision for the sale of military weapons of historical significance or with commercial equivalents, in accordance with State gun laws and after being rendered inoperable if automatic or semi-automatic in operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is able to control the import of firearms  under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACT Weapons Act 1991 does, nevertheless, impose an obligation on an ACT person selling a weapon to a person interstate to have reasonable belief that the possession of the weapon by the purchaser in the other State or Territory is not proscribed by the law of that other jurisdiction. A penalty of $2 000 or imprisonment for twelve months, or both, is provided (section 78).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act will, of course, apply to an ACT person who purchases a weapon from interstate by mail order.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rifle Clubs established under the Defence Act should be brought under the ambit of State licensing and registration requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Defence considers that the legislation governing rifle clubs is an anachronistic and unnecessary use of defence powers. In 1988 the Minister for Defence approved repeal of the relevant legislation (the Australian Rifle Club Regulations) but the repeal was disallowed by the Senate. Since then the Department of Defence has been in negotiation with the two peak councils of rifle clubs towards achieving a common view on the jurisdiction that should govern rifle shooting as a sport. To date agreement has not been reached and negotiations are continuing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department believes that there is no sound basis for legislation governing firearms in rifle clubs to be separate from legislation governing all other firearms. Adoption of uniform firearms legislation would remove the principal argument for keeping rifle clubs under a Commonwealth umbrella, namely that variations in State law (and non-portability of registration) cause difficulties in the transportation of weapons for competition purposes.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Northern Territory</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1988 Police proposed these changes but they are not reflected in the proposed Firearms Bill. This was because the Northern Territory shooting lobby opposed such changes when negotiations in the Bill were conducted. The shooting lobby argued that the rifle clubs were well run and self-regulating and caused no problems to police. Further, the majority of rifle club members voluntarily registered their firearms and obtained appropriate classes of firearms licences.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prohibition of all automatic long arms and certain types of ammunition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NSW gun laws have prohibited automatic long arms since 1973. There is no restriction on types of ammunition available, but various types of ammunition have been banned by the Commonwealth from import. In addition, a purchaser of ammunition is only able to purchase ammunition of the calibre which is suitable to the firearm covered by his licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In WA legislation is in existence prohibiting these types of firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Police Department agrees with the prohibition of all fully automatic firearms. However, upon the recommendation of the Select Committee, the yet to be proclaimed Firearms Act Amendment Act 1988 will allow any dealer to possess and deal in fully automatic firearms and allow a person holding an appropriate firearms licence to possess such firearms. The Government will need to legislate to restrict the possession of fully automatic firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prohibition of certain types of ammunition is currently addressed under the Explosives Act but will in the near future be included in the amendments to the Dangerous Substances legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Guns Act 1991 prohibits fully-automatic longarms and restricts their possession to those persons who are genuine collectors. The Act contains no provisions prohibiting certain types of ammunition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Northern Territory</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Recommendation needs further clarification. The word `automatic' is sometimes ambiguous. If it means `fully automatic' then the present Northern Territory Firearms Act covers this. If it means `semi-automatic' then the new Firearms Act does not go as far as recommended. Semi automatic rifles are highly restricted, but not prohibited. However, the recommendation goes beyond rifles and includes shot guns. Semi automatic shot guns are not often seen in criminal activities. Any move to restrict them would be very strongly opposed by interest groups. The new Firearms Act removes numerous loopholes in the restriction of `D' class firearms, for example, semi-automatic rifles. Also note that ammunition is restricted under the Dangerous Goods Act. The Recommendation does not make it clear what types of ammunition are to be prohibited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Capital Territory</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACT Government supports the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Weapons Act 1991 has the effect of prohibiting all automatic weapons not merely long arms. The Act also limits the possession and use of pistol grip weapons with the effect that such weapons will only be acceptable for use by current owners for competition shooting purposes and will be phased out over time. The Act also prohibits the sale of any ammunition which is suitable only for such weapons.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Included in the new Firearms Act is the requirement to be over the age of eighteen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `fit and proper' requirement is included in the present Firearms Act and the new Firearms Act. However, `sufficient reason' is required for licences in respect of firearms classes `C' (pistols) and `D' (firearms not normally permitted in the Northern Territory. Should this be extended to classes `A' (rifles, shot-guns and air rifles, not including semi-automatic) and `B' (all other rifles and shot-guns that are semi-automatic, and centre fire rifles), as the National Committee on Violence recommends, then a decision has to be made as to what constitutes `sufficient reason'.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Firearms Act, provides a cooling off period of fourteen days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Firearms Act deals with this but may not go as far as the National Committee on Violence (NCV) recommends. The NCV wants `demonstration' of training etc., whereas the Bill requires the Commissioner to be `satisfied' that training etc. is adequate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Recommendation that pistols be `stored on the premises' is also of dubious merit. The intention appears to be that pistols be kept at the place where they may be lawfully used, so as to reduce the possibility that they will be used in a domestic violence situation. Balanced against that is the fact that such `premises' will be unattended for most nights and some days, leaving the pistols at risk of theft. Given that licensees are subject to considerable scrutiny, it may be preferable to allow pistols to be kept in owners' homes.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 22 May 1993 the Australasian Police Ministers' Council (APMC) considered a report from the Police Commissioners' Policy Advisory Group (PCPAG) on guidelines for police use of lethal force, which had been prepared in response to this recommendation. The guidelines were modelled, as far as possible, on the UN Guidelines `Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials'. Where appropriate, however, prevailing local guidelines were preferred where their standard exceeded that adopted by the United Nations. The APMC resolved to adopt the guidelines as minimum national standards on the use of firearms and other lethal force by police. They form the basis of operational instructions for individual police jurisdictions throughout the country. These minimum guidelines are able to be built on if necessary by individual jurisdictions in their administrative and operational procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Guidelines for the Use of Lethal Force by Police</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Police officers will not use firearms against another person except in self-defence or the defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent his or her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives. In any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Police will report promptly to their superiors, in accordance with established procedures, all instances involving the use of lethal force causing death or injury.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. Police may use lethal force (other than by use of firearms) in accordance with their training and with reasoned discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Training</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Police management will provide ongoing training for all police officers in accordance with these guidelines. All training programs and operational procedures will be regularly reviewed and evaluated in the light of relevant incidents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Training will include special attention to human rights and ethical issues in the use of force, alternatives including the peaceful settlement of conflict, the understanding of crowd behaviour, methods of persuasion, negotiation and mediation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Police management will ensure that the use of lethal force causing death or injury, is reviewable by independent processes appropriate to each jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should also be carefully noted that a police officer will not be able to rely on a defence that he/she is only following superior orders, if it can be clearly shown that such orders were `manifestly unlawful and the officer had a reasonable opportunity to refuse to follow it'. In any case, responsibility also rests on the superiors who gave the unlawful orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At its meeting on 22 May 1992 the Australasian Police Ministers Council resolved to adopt guidelines developed by the Police Commissioners Policy Advisory Group on minimum national standards on the use of firearms and other lethal force by police. The general principles set out in the guidelines are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pursuant to their responsibilities, police officers will only resort to the use of force when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty; and,</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria Police Force Instruction (Force Circular Memorandum 92-2-19), which regulates the use of firearms by police officers, reflects this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Uniform guidelines regarding the use of lethal force by police were endorsed by the Conference of Commissioners of Australasia and the South West Pacific Region. These guidelines have been distributed to Queensland Police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of firearms and force by police is strictly controlled by general orders and rigidly enforced by supervisors and senior police. Lethal force is only condoned as a last resort, involving self-defence and defence of others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criminal law Consolidation (Self defence) Amendment Act 1991 sets out the law on self-defence and reflects the principle that lethal force should only be used as a last resort, involving self-defence and the defence of others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania has introduced gun control legislation in the form of the Guns Act 1991, which replaced the Firearms Act 1932. This new legislation is not completely uniform with similar legislation in other states, nevertheless, the legislation exercises much more control over firearm ownership, sales and use than previous law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Northern Territory</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 28 of the Criminal Code governs the use of force which is likely to cause death or grievous harm and is consistent with this recommendation. Any move towards uniform laws of this nature would be strongly supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Capital Territory</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACT Government supports the recommendation and is aware that Ministers resolved at the Australian Police Ministers Council meeting on 22 May 1992 to adopt the guidelines developed by the Police Commissioners Policy Advisory Group as minimum national standards on the use of Firearms and other lethal police force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government support these guidelines noting the importance of jurisdictional uniformity in the use of firearms and other lethal force by police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AFP Policy and Procedures on Police use of Force are consistent with this recommendation. Further, current policy and practices applying within the AFP generally meet or exceed the standards contained in the aforementioned guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 85.2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of adequate resources (including funding) to ensure police receive adequate training in the use of firearms and non-lethal weapons. This training should also include non-violent restraint and conflict resolution strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth supports this recommendation. Australian Federal Police firearms training is designed not only to provide members with firearms safety and use skills, but also, through the use of the latest training technology, enhance a members knowledge and decision making relating to when the use of lethal force is required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW Police Service's Police Recruit Education Program (PREP) provides detailed training to new police officers on the use of lethal force, with emphasis on the use of non-violent restraint techniques. Additionally, all operational police attend refresher courses on both firearm use and non-violent restraint techniques.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Firearms and Operational Survival Training Unit was established by Victoria Police with funding provided in the 1990-1991 State Budget. The Unit continues to operate within Victoria Police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Training for new recruits to the Queensland Police Service now includes tertiary level studies through the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and Griffith University. Mediation, human relations and conflict resolution skills are core elements of that training. In addition significant training in non-violent restraint and firearm use is provided through the Police Academy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ongoing in-service professional development for police officers is currently under review with a new curriculum in the formative stage. This will also include detailed non-violent approaches to conflict resolution and regular firearm training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Police training in the use of firearms has recently been the subject of a total review and upgrading. New procedures have now been implemented although non-lethal weapons have not been addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Northern Territory</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter of firearm training is presently under review in the NT. A project is currently underway which intends, as one of its aims, to completely review the NT Police firearms training standard. As a consequence a new standard will be adopted, probably before the commencement of the 1993-94 financial year. Training will then commence to this standard as soon as practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-lethal weapon restraint training has been regularly taught as part of recruit training over the past nine years. In mid-1990 an instructor cadre in this subject involving six police members received specialist training. These members are used for continued recruit training and also to form a future regional training nucleus for regular retraining of operational members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Capital Territory</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACT Government supports the recommendation noting that jurisdictional uniformity amongst law enforcement agencies is difficult to obtain and that the matter is to be considered by the Australian Police Ministers' Council. The AFP's policy and procedures on police use of force are covered by AFP General Orders and General Instructions. These policies are consistent with the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 85.3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A requirement that wherever practical, a Coroner personally attends the scene of any fatality involving the use of lethal force by police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event of a death occurring as a result of the use of lethal force by police, the practice is that the Duty Operations Inspector at Police Headquarters would notify, as quickly as possible, the State Coroner and the Coronial Investigation Unit (on secondment to the Attorney General's Department); or, if the State Coroner could not be contacted, the Deputy State Coroner. Whether or not the State Coroner or Deputy State Coroner would attend the scene where the fatality occurred, shortly after notification, would depend on the circumstances of each case. In particular, it would depend on whether it is likely that an indictable charge may be laid, as the Coroner does not become involved if an indictable charge has been laid in connection with a death.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria Police Force Instructions (Operating Procedures Manual, chapter 9) requires the State Coroner to be notified in such cases. In practice, the Coroner attends personally, all scenes of fatalities involving the use by police of lethal force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the Queensland Police Service, the Professional Standards Unit (Internal Investigations) and the Homicide Squad are required to investigate where a fatality occurs as a result of lethal force used by police. Under current law, the Criminal Justice Commission has the authority to take responsibility for, or overview police investigations of fatal incidents involving police. Such incidents would eventually be subject to a coroner's inquiry. It is noted that a review of the Coroner's Act is currently underway and new policy and procedures are likely to emerge from that process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present there is no such policy for the coroner to personally attend the scene of a fatality involving the use of lethal force by police, nor has any need been identified previously for such a policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coroners currently attend fatalities involving the use of lethal force by police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Northern Territory</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst this recommendation is supported in principle, this matter will need to be reviewed by the Department of Law, particularly having regard to the resource implications that may follow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Capital Territory</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACT Government supports the recommendation. This is normal practice in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 85.4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of funding for the development and deployment of non-lethal incapacitating weapons for use in appropriate situations, bearing in mind the desirability of eventually excluding the use of all weapons capable of causing death or serious injury to persons. The development and deployment of non-lethal weapons should be carefully evaluated, to ensure they minimise the risk of injury to bystanders, suspects, and police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will ask the National Police Research Unit (NPRU) to evaluate the possibility of greater use of non-lethal weapons. The NPRU is currently working on the development of national minimum standards for police firearms training. These standards will cover training on the use of non-lethal weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Federal Police (AFP) only deploys weapons after thorough evaluation. The NPRU also undertakes equipment evaluation on behalf of all Australian police forces. The Commonwealth provides a third of the funding for the NPRU.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Commonwealth level, policy and procedures on police use of force are covered by AFP General Orders and General Instructions. The Australian Capital Territory Region is of course covered by these policies, which adequately cover these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Police Research Unit Board of Control approved a project to examine present standards of firearms training with a view to developing recommended minimum national standards in relation to the validation and accreditation of firearms training and use of other weapons including non-lethal weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project is progressing in three phases with the phase I considering a standardised approach to firearms training and the development of national competency standards. Phase II will report on safety and judgemental aspects of firearms handling whilst Phase III is planned to address the question of non-lethal weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that Phase III will commence in October 1993 with a report being presented to the Board of Control in March 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Police Research Unit, Victoria Police Firearms and Operational Survival Training Unit have been discussing research into non-lethal weapons.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Police Research Unit is undertaking a study of non-lethal incapacitating weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to the level of funding or other commitment to provide for the development and deployment of non-lethal incapacitating weapons (batons or handcuffs for example), the South Australia Police Department does not have any set specific funding for the development and deployment of non-lethal weapons. The purchase of such weapons is on a needs basis, and training in the use of such is part of normal training procedures. The Department, from time to time, evaluates such weapons as part of normal departmental procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmanian Police supports, in principle, the concept of non-lethal weapons capable of incapacitating rather than causing death or serious injury.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Northern Territory</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Territory Police rely upon evaluations carried out by the National Police Research Unit and the larger Australian Police Forces. Such weapons would not be deployed until they have been fully evaluated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Capital Territory</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACT Government supports in principle the concept of non-lethal incapacitating weapons subject to rigorous evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of such weapons is not a cost effective enterprise for the AFP particularly in relation to the ACT. The AFP deploys weapons only after thorough evaluation drawing on the experience of other police forces within Australia and overseas.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All police administrators should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 86.1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adopt and implement rules and regulations strictly limiting the use of force and firearms. These should emphasise the principle that the use of force and firearms by law enforcement personnel should be proportionate to the legitimate objectives to be achieved, and commensurate with due respect for human rights. In addition, wherever the use of force or firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement personnel should in all cases minimise damage, respect and preserve human life and ensure that assistance and medical aid is rendered to any injured or affected persons at the earliest possible moment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NSW Police Commissioner's Instructions strictly regulate the use of force and firearms and require that medical aid be rendered as soon as possible. The notion that police should shoot to wound is rejected for, by having such an instruction, police would be more likely to use firearms. The Commissioner's Instructions essentially state that police are to shoot only if they have a justifiable belief that they or a member of the community is in imminent danger of being killed.

In the latter the legal implications on the use of firearms is explained and members must not use firearms in circumstances which are likely to kill or injure except in extreme circumstances. If a firearm is used in such circumstances, any action is the subject of a thorough, objective and independent investigation. In fact a member must report every instance when he or she discharges a firearm whilst on duty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NT review being conducted on lethal and non-lethal weapons will address the issue of accountability in the use of force and weapons in general.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter of firearm training is presently under review in the NT Police as a result of the introduction of a new firearm for issue to police officers. The review is because of the recommendation of the NT Police Firearms Review Committee, and recommendations of a National Police Research Unit paper on the subject of national Police Firearms Training Standards. The final report on this subject from the NPRU has not been released to date, but the NT Police have commented on the final draft of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A project is presently under way which has as one of its aims to completely review the firearms training standard in light of both the NT police and NPRU reports. As a consequence a new standard will be adopted, probably before the commencement of the 1993-94 financial year. Training will then commence to this standard as soon as practicable.

There may be some changes to the training which has been conducted in this regard for the past ten years. However the changes will be in detail only and not likely to be changes in principal. The changes required are necessary because of likely changes to non-lethal weapons such as batons issued to police officers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Yes. Participants who do not complete programs are included when calculating positive outcomes. Post program monitoring data show positive outcomes for 53% of participants who completed programs in 1992-93. Of the 28% who left program assistance prior to their expected completion date, 42% obtained a positive outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) &amp; (6) There is no program which results in participants being automatically excluded from the scope of the ABS Labour Force Survey. How participants are classified for the purposes of that survey depends on how they interpret their situation when responding to survey questions. Questions are asked independently of any participation in labour market programs. Questions focus on whether the person was available for work or did any work in the week before the interview and their efforts to find work in the month before the interview.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responses of survey participants engaged in labour market programs are likely to vary according to the nature of the program in question. Thus participants in subsidised employment and work experience programs such as JOBSTART, the Employment Incentive Scheme, the Landcare and Environment Action Program (LEAP), JOBSKILLS and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) would probably regard themselves as being in work and, therefore, be classified as employed. By contrast, participants in programs such as Job Clubs or Job Search Training courses would probably consider themselves as looking for work and consequently be classified as unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Since 1991, evaluations of JOBSTART, JOBTRAIN, SkillShare and Job Clubs have been conducted in relation to outcomes six months after program participation. The evaluation of the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) assessed outcomes twelve months after program completion. The evaluation of the Australian Traineeship System (ATS) collected outcomes data twelve months and twenty-four months after program cessation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8)(a) For 1992-93, positive program outcomes three months after program cessation were 59%, 39%, 42% and 47% for JOBSTART, JOBTRAIN, SkillShare and Job Clubs respectively.

The evaluation of NEIS showed that three months after program completion some 64% of participants were in self-employment and a further 9% were in other employment.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. The budget for the campaign was $605 000, covering activity in financial years 1992-93 and 1993-94. The budget was funded jointly by DPIE and DFAT from within existing running costs. Pending finalisation of accounts, as at 15 December 1993 expenditure was $590 000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, it has been estimated by DFAT that over the course of the campaign expenditure by overseas posts related directly to the candidature will amount to $145 000. Lobbying host country governments on such matters is one of the normal priorities of diplomatic representation, therefore these costs have been met from the running costs of Australia's overseas missions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAO campaign supported Australia's international objectives in three important areas: agricultural trade, reform of the UN system and refocussing international development assistance. The campaign made a useful contribution in these three areas, even though it was ultimately unsuccessful. The quality and integrity of the candidature and the campaign reflected well upon Australia. Dr Miller was the last candidate to be beaten, in the sixth ballot after 9 hours of balloting. Candidates from Greece, Ireland, Bangladesh, Holland, Germany, India and Chile were defeated or withdrew before the final runoff between Dr Miller and the eventual winner, Dr Diouf from Senegal. If ten countries had changed sides, the Australian candidate would have won. Thus the defeat was extremely narrow. This international candidature was publicly endorsed by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Also representations in support of Dr Miller were made in overseas countries by the Leader of the National Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Dr Miller visited 66 countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I am advised that, while details of accounts are still being finalised, the cost of Dr Miller's travel is estimated at $285 900, covering fares, travelling allowance and accommodation. This figure is included in the budget of $605 000 referred to in question 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Dr Miller's campaign travel was undertaken over the period from 3 October 1992 to 12 November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Dr Miller travelled as Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy from 3 October 1992 to 23 March 1993. Thereafter, he travelled as Associate Secretary for Agriculture, Government of Australia. Much of his travel was complementary with the pursuit of other Australian government business in agricultural trade or development assistance. Some substituted for travel that would have been undertaken by others. Over the campaign period and in the course of his international travel, Dr Miller participated in nine significant international meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Dr Miller was paid his normal salary as a departmental Secretary ($124 275 pa) during the period while he was travelling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Yes. Mr John Kerin MP travelled from Australia specifically to lobby other countries. Mr Kerin was asked to lobby selected countries in Africa on Australia's behalf because he had a strong, personal relationship with Ministers in Africa built up over the years he was the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and Minister for Trade and Development Cooperation. The countries selected were those in South and East Africa most of which Dr Miller had not visited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others from Australia and overseas undertook to lobby in support of this Australian candidature in the course of their other international activities. These included Federal and State Ministers and Parliamentarians, Ministers and officials from other countries, officers of the APS and other agencies and private citizens. This lobbying was not a cost to the campaign budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) (a) Details of the accounts are still being finalised, however, the cost of airfares, land transport, accommodation and travelling allowance for Mr Kerin is estimated at $12 571.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Mr Kerin's travel was planned to cover the following countries: Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Tanzania. Mr Kerin was only able to visit Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi. He was prevented from travelling further as he was unable to depart Burundi for seven days because of a coup.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Yes, a booklet, written primarily by Dr Miller and formatted in DPIE, was produced to support this Australian candidature. The booklet set out positions on many issues of great ongoing significance in agricultural development and international trade. Dr Miller also drafted and issued twenty major statements on important issues on the global food and agriculture agenda during the campaign. These were issued to governments throughout the world and to the international media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The cost of printing and translating the booklet was $44 265.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) Yes, an informal interdepartmental Committee (IDC) was established to coordinate the campaign for the FAO Director-General position.

This measure was announced in August 1992 as part of the 1992 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since mid-November about 400,000 families have been asked to give my Department details of any of these benefits  which they receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first stage of the employer-provided benefits data collection involved a mail-out to all income-tested additional Family Payment clients and all Basic Family Payment (BFP) clients who indicated that their taxable income was above $50,000. In the week commencing 15 November 1993, 395,776 letters were sent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second stage of the employer-provided benefits data collection involves progressively issuing fringe benefits modules to BFP clients with high incomes as they return their end of year review forms. (People claiming Family Payment between 10 November and the end of 1993 will also have to complete a module). The precise number of letters issued to this group is not known.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iv) Each day, the DSS state Computer Centres automatically generate the letters to clients and manually pack the modules and multilingual inserts with the letters. At the beginning of the progressive mail-out, staff at the Melbourne and Sydney Computer Centres did not include the module and the multilingual insert with the letter. This happened for one day in Melbourne (10 November) and two days in Sydney (15 and 16 November).</PARA>
