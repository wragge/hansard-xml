<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Friday, 2 July 1993, of Sir (Ernest) Edward `Weary' Dunlop, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>In recent weeks, all Australians have mourned the loss of Sir Edward Weary Dunlop. He was 85. Through his work as a surgeon in prisoner of war camps in Asia during the Second World War, and through his postwar work assisting veterans and his efforts in strengthening the relationship between Australia and Asia, Weary Dunlop was a figure not just honoured and revered in this country but also, I think it is fair to say, genuinely loved by his fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was born into a farming family in northern Victoria in 1907. After an active and happy childhood, he gained qualifications in both pharmacy and medicine. His student days in Melbourne were full to the brim, as he was also a brilliant sportsman, becoming a champion at boxing and rugby union. He was in London undertaking postgraduate work in surgery when the war began. He loved his work, but the outbreak of war made life at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, seem like a `charmed circle', as he put it. By pulling some strings he managed to enlist in the 2nd AIF from London, and was posted directly to Jerusalem in November 1939 with the rank of captain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his two years in the Middle East, his appetite for adventure meant that he was rarely far from the centre of action. He served in Libya, Greece and Crete, and volunteered for service with the Australian Casualty Clearing Station in besieged Tobruk. He declined command of that unit, preferring to retain the surgical post of major. On his way back to Australia with the 7th Division, his ship was diverted to Java in a desperate bid to stem the Japanese move southward. He was taken prisoner of war in February 1942. He was moved to Batavia, Singapore, and finally to Konyu camp along the route of the now notorious Burma-Thailand railway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Konyu, and at further camps along the line, Dunlop and his fellow prisoners faced some of the most appalling conditions ever experienced by Australians at war. Men were daily forced out to work, clearing the jungle to make way for the railway. Malaria, dysentery, tropical ulcers, cholera and beri-beri were common, exacerbated by malnutrition and brutal punishment by Japanese and Korean guards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again, Sir Edward Dunlop intervened to stop desperately sick men being forced to work. He fashioned surgical instruments and equipment from whatever was at hand and operated on his patients by oil light. He used all his wiles to obtain food and drugs. He saw his men out in the morning and was there to greet them when they arrived back exhausted in the evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was often sick himself and was punished, and three times he was threatened with execution for his intercession on behalf of the sick. Although forbidden to do so, he kept a radio and a detailed diary. His experience as a prisoner fostered in him insights into humanity that shaped the rest of his life. In his diary he allowed himself only snatches of despair and ill feeling towards the Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1943, he admitted to a `searing hate', as he expressed it, arising in him whenever he saw a Japanese. He was as capable of hatred as he was of love, but ultimately he could not suppress from developing a deep compassion for the Japanese when he understood the wretchedness of their position at the end of the war. At the end of his war diary he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been a war against monstrous things, but one for which we all share responsibility because of the selfish pre-occupations which allowed matters to reach such hideous proportions.</PARA>
<PARA>He resolved then to make the welfare of ex-prisoners of war a lifetime mission. In the postwar years, as he rose to prominence as a surgeon in Melbourne, he was tireless in the service of his former comrades, active in prisoner of war associations and once again intervening on their behalf whenever he could. Many former prisoners of war found him an active champion in handling the complexities of repatriation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, he lacked any sense of bitterness or desire for recriminations against the Japanese. Instead, he set about promoting links between Australia and Asia, and with Japan in particular. He was active in the health program sponsored under the Colombo Plan initiated by Australia in 1950 to promote cooperation with, and assistance to, South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1969 he led an Australian medical team into South Vietnam to provide care for civilians injured in the war. Honours were heaped on him in Australia and overseas, particularly in Thailand and Sri Lanka. He was made a knight bachelor in 1969, Australian of the Year in 1976 and a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1987.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through it all he remained essentially a very humble man and, like many ex-service people, not necessarily very comfortable in talking about his wartime experiences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the tributes that have been paid to him since his death so many people have remembered his unfailing ability to see some good in everyone, including his enemies. It was that ability that drove his courage, his sense of duty and his capacity to forgive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With his great love and understanding of humanity, Sir Edward Weary Dunlop will be very sadly missed probably not simply by his family, most especially, and his friends, but by those with whom he maintained associations after the war, by those with whom he was a prisoner of war and for whom he was a leader. I know that a number of them are in the gallery today, including a former member of this House, the former honourable member for Reid, Tom Uren, who also served under Sir Edward Dunlop as a prisoner of war on the Burma-Thailand railway. I know that on the day of his funeral service in Melbourne so many of the people with whom he had served as a prisoner of war were there at the cathedral. They had obviously kept in contact with him and will miss him most sincerely. On behalf of the government, I extend our sincere sympathy to his family in its bereavement. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Wentworth-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. It is right that this national parliament should recognise and honour the life and work of Sir Edward Weary Dunlop. I am very pleased to support what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has just said about a truly great Australian. We mourn the passing of Weary Dunlop because of who he was, because of what he achieved and because of the sense of community which inspired all that he did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With his death on 2 July, Australia lost one of its finest citizens and one of its greatest heroes. His contribution to our national life was unique. In all he did&mdash;as a scholar, as a sportsman, as a soldier, as a surgeon, as a community leader, and as a husband and father&mdash;Weary Dunlop brought an uncompromising commitment to human dignity, a faith in the ultimate power of what is right and the pursuit of excellence in the service of the common good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Weary Dunlop, of course, fought many battles in his life. He fought disease and suffering; he fought unfairness and injustice; he fought impoverishment of the human spirit and he fought a brutal enemy in a war that preyed on both the minds and the bodies of those who endured it. In all of these battles Weary Dunlop faced enormous odds, and in all of them he triumphed&mdash;not in any way that craved popular acclaim, but in a quiet, self-effacing manner that was his hallmark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His gifts and his compassion for all people were matched only by his modesty. During the Second World War his leadership and care of allied prisoners of war became a legend. On the Burma-Siam railway Sir Edward became a byword for courage, for compassion and for skill in the face of almost unimaginable cruelty and despair. As human suffering, disease and a sense of hopelessness threatened to consume everything, Weary Dunlop shone like a light in the darkness. One of his fellow prisoners of war, Donald Stuart, put it best years after the war when he wrote of Weary Dunlop in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When despair and death reached for us he stood fast, his only thought our well-being. Faced with guards who had the power of life and death, ignoble tyrants who hated us, he was a lighthouse of sanity in a universe of madness and suffering.</PARA>
<PARA>Another wrote that Sir Edward was like a mountain&mdash;the further you got away from him, the bigger you realised he was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Weary Dunlop lifted spirits as much as he alleviated physical suffering. He inspired broken men and he drew his own inspiration from them. He healed broken bodies, despite the absence of proper medical supplies and proper medical instruments. For those whom he could not heal, he at least gave some dignity in death. He achieved these things and so much more in the most appalling and the most degrading of circumstances, and he did so in a way that epitomised what is best in the Australian character&mdash;defiance against the odds, mateship, resolve and faith in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A story told by Dr Max Lake about Weary Dunlop typifies, I believe, many of his qualities. The story goes as follows: Weary discovered a man tampering with his car. When challenged, the man made his first mistake by taking off, because Weary had a blue for running. He made his second mistake by trying to dodge, because Weary was a football blue and he tackled him. He made his final and most serious mistake by shaping up and having a go. Weary had a blue for boxing and he broke his jaw. Weary then gathered him up, drove him to the hospital, set his jaw and arranged for the discharge and review of the patient at the next convenient outpatient clinic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the war Sir Edward continued the physical care and moral support of those with whom he had shared so much. Like Tennyson, who was a poet he much admired, Sir Edward could truly say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a part of all that I have met.</PARA>
<PARA>Weary Dunlop never forgot the past and all who shared its sacrifices with him. But he always looked to the future&mdash;a future full of promise, hope and faith in the human spirit. He always valued what he described as the timeless, enduring, special brotherhood that was shared with all survivors of prison camps. He never became vindictive, though few men had more reason to be so. He always remained inspired by what he once described as a belief that all the races of mankind bear some special mark of God's tenderness, some unique contribution to humankind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range of his postwar interests was testimony to the breadth of his vision and his compassion. He worked tirelessly for many causes associated with the welfare of his fellow citizens, including health care for the aged, medical research, the Anti-Cancer Council, ex-servicemen's associations, the Council for the Welfare of Overseas Students and, of course, relations with countries of the Asia-Pacific region generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Edward Dunlop received many awards and many honours for his life's work, but his greatest memorial lies in the special place he holds in the hearts and minds of those with whom he shared his life. It was Tennyson who wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tho' much is taken, much abides.</PARA>
<PARA>What has been taken from us is Sir Edward's physical presence. What abides is his spirit, the enduring achievements of his life's work and the deep respect and affection with which his memory is honoured in Australia and in many other countries. In his war diaries, Sir Edward noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the annals of human suffering, Australians had written something very special of their own, and handed on a precious legacy to the future.</PARA>
<PARA>Sir Edward Weary Dunlop has handed on to future generations of Australians his own very precious legacy. His life and work, his sense of duty and his compassion for his fellow human beings will always be an inspiration to Australians and to men and women right around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join wholeheartedly with the Prime Minister in what he has said today about Sir Edward Weary Dunlop. On behalf of the coalition parties, I support the motion before the House and I extend my deepest sympathy to Sir Edward's family and to his many friends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a privilege to speak in support of this motion of condolence in relation to Sir Edward Weary Dunlop&mdash;a warrior on many fronts, a man who wrought many medical wonders and miracles, an extraordinary hero. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) have said, yet at the end of the day, Sir Edward was a humble, generous and truly courageous man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on the dispatch box a section of the Burma Death Railway, or Burma-Thailand Railway, as a particular mark of respect to someone who did so much to ease the burden of so many in acts of heroism, day after day, as the work proceeded on this railway line through terrible terrain and in horrific conditions. The Australian-Thailand Chamber of Commerce presented this section of line to me. It comes from near Nam Tok and Konyu Cutting and near the Hell Fire Pass Memorial, which is attracting more attention each Anzac Day in Thailand. I commend a visit to those honourable members who are able to do so. They will see first hand a section of the Burma Death Railway, the setting of that Konyu Cutting or Hell Fire Pass, and will begin to appreciate the agony and horrific circumstances that faced so many prisoners of war during World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To walk through Konyu Cutting even on a hot Thailand day seems to chill one to the bone on the steep side of the valley, as the line climbs from Nam Tok to Bagodars Pass and on into Burma. Former members of this parliament&mdash;Tom Uren, who is in the gallery today, and Sir John Carrick&mdash;along with thousands of other prisoners of war, toiled in those extremely harsh conditions along the line. They suffered from sickness, from injuries due to bashings by the guards, and a range of other factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of this turmoil, Sir Edward Weary Dunlop showed great leadership, great surgical skills and a great capacity in his work as a doctor in very trying circumstances, at times risking his own life in standing up for the regime. He was the recipient of many bashings by Korean and Japanese guards and, worse still, he faced an execution countdown on at least two occasions. I will quote a short, chilling extract from page 303 of the war diaries of Weary Dunlop:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At last I was told patience was now exhausted and I must die. I was pushed and flogged along to a tree and my manacles changed to encircle my wrists behind the tree with my body and arms taut about the tree, my bare belly exposed to four bayonets wielded by an execution squad of four, making the characteristic belly grunting, blood-curdling yells, working themselves up to `the moment'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was told by the interpreter&mdash;the one in the party with long hair&mdash;that I was to have the grace of 30 seconds, which were grimly counted in Japanese. My eyes were locked on the flinty, impassive face of the `interrogating' officer. Strange thoughts flitted through my mind.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The egregious voice of the interpreter&mdash;`Now ten seconds to go. Have you last message for relatives. I shall try to convey'. I shifted my gaze to his distasteful face and said contemptuously: `Last message conveyed by thugs like you&mdash;no thanks!' The bayonets were withdrawn and poised for the last yelling thrust when I saw a flush on the face of my executioner who raised a hand and cried, `Stop! He will suffer a lot more than this before he dies&mdash;untie him!' The manacles were transferred to the front and I suffered a bout of heavy beating without further interrogation.</PARA>
<PARA>This man, Sir Edward Weary Dunlop, had nearly another two years in captivity after that particular incident but he continued his work. He continued to provide his leadership, helping hundreds upon hundreds of prisoners of war in those trying circumstances in Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just add two other aspects in relation to his war efforts. Firstly, Sir Edward saw extensive service in other theatres of war even before reaching Asia. In 1940 he was posted to Jerusalem, Palestine, Greece, Crete and Tobruk. As the Prime Minister said, Sir Edward arrived in Java on 17 February 1942, already having given adequate and capable service in World War II in the European and Middle East theatres of war. He was promoted to command No. 1 Allied General Hospital. At capitulation, Sir Edward Weary Dunlop elected to stay with his hospital and patients and become a prisoner of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, he returned to Asia in the 1960s, at some risk, as a man who had seen so much. He returned as a team leader with the Australian surgical team in the Vietnam War, caring for civilians&mdash;the Vietnamese&mdash;and Australian soldiers. However, there are other aspects of his extraordinary life which point to his ability against all odds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, on a lighter note, I refer to the fact that he was selected for, and played in, the Australian rugby team of the 1930s. That is significant enough, some might argue, but, even more significantly, he achieved this selection as a person born in Victoria and as a student of Melbourne University&mdash;a long way from the power houses of rugby in Sydney and Brisbane. I think honourable members will concede that that is no mean feat. Interestingly, he wore the test rugby guernsey or jumper when taken to hospital the last time. I quote from the eulogy by Dr Donaldson at St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Weary' arrived at that heavenly playing field dressed to play the game.</PARA>
<PARA>To all of this I might also add that Sir Edward Weary Dunlop made a point of coming all the way to the small town of Jerilderie in my electorate on Australia Day 1988, the bicentennial year, to deliver a fine address in the searing heat of the late afternoon of a Riverina summer's day. He received many accolades on that occasion, as he deserved to. But he thought not much of the effort and he was very happy to be there. Nothing was too small or too large for Weary Dunlop to contribute to or play a key role in, as the ever helpful person he was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To members of the Dunlop family, to the ex-servicemen's community, and particularly to ex-prisoners of war, I extend my sympathy on behalf of the National Party of Australia and on behalf of my colleagues. I strongly support the comments of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. As a Vietnam veteran, I salute Sir Edward Weary Dunlop for all he did in service to his country and in service to mankind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to support the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I also support the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). I had the pleasure of meeting with Sir Edward&mdash;more affectionately known as Weary&mdash;Dunlop during my term of office as Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Weary was a marvellous man and somebody that I will never forget. I have had the pleasure of meeting many distinguished servicemen and women over the years that I was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, including some very highly decorated Australians. I know they will forgive me for saying today that Sir Weary to me was the one veteran above all others who captured my never ending admiration and total respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He always assisted me and the Department of Veterans' Affairs when asked to do so. I know that Secretary Tanzer, Secretary Woodward and all the people in the Department of Veterans' Affairs had the greatest admiration for Weary Dunlop. I want to place that on record here today. I remember the occasion when we went to Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital for a health week campaign for the veterans of Heidelberg. We had had a good talk to them when Weary turned up. It was a medi-dump campaign to make sure the veterans were getting rid of all their old pharmaceuticals that were out of date. Weary spoke to them in that regard and told them that they should not have their medications for too long; that they should get rid of them and hand them in at the hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Afterwards we had a lovely afternoon tea and a progressive barn dance. All the ladies and war widows lined up to dance with Weary&mdash;and I also danced. I did not do the quickstep, but I have to admit that I had to sit down before Weary. I tried to find out why they called him Weary Dunlop. I thought it must be `Time shall not weary them' because he just kept working on behalf of the veterans community. But it was something to do with Dunlop tyres and weary Dunlop tyres or something like that. I will not say any more about that and condemn the Dunlop tyres of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all those years as Minister for Veterans' Affairs and in going to many POW celebrations and commemorations, not once at all the different conferences or functions did I hear anybody say a bad word about Weary Dunlop. And I must say, as far as I can remember, Weary Dunlop never said a bad word about anybody. He only once challenged me, saying, `Look, you shouldn't be making these cutbacks in the veterans' affairs portfolio'. I said, `I don't believe that we've done that, Weary, but if you can show me where I'll be happy to correct that'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only was Weary on my back in those days but also I can remember the day Tom Uren&mdash;it is good to see Tom here today&mdash;was in the office with the Prime Minister, who was then the Treasurer. Tom was making sure that in the budget that was coming up we did the right thing on behalf of the POWs&mdash;especially the POWs. Tom always spoke on behalf of all veterans, just as Weary did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I checked up through the department on a few figures today. Weary was one of 22,376 Australian POWs in 1942. Three years later there were 14,345, and Weary was one of them. That was the number repatriated. I know that a lot of them owe a great debt of gratitude not only to Weary but also to all the other doctors that were there working on behalf of those veterans. There were many others. I saw a letter in the newspaper one day saying that Weary was not the only doctor in the POW camps, but it would be fair to say that Weary stood out amongst all of them, although I know Weary never thought he was any better than anybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of us went to Weary's state funeral. I must congratulate everyone in the protocol department that took part in organising that funeral. I was very moved by the sermon of the Reverend Dr James Donaldson and the eulogy of Sir Ninian Stephen. I should like to quote from them, so I know all honourable members will bear with me. It is not very often that one can sit through sermons and enjoy them. I must admit that, as the minister of the day, I did not realise what a great person Weary Dunlop was until I went to the funeral. I knew a lot about him but not enough. The Reverend Donaldson said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we come to honour such a great man today let us briefly take these two aspects of Weary's life namely, (1) the capacity to forget ourselves and our own needs in order to serve others, and (2) the capacity to forgive and bring about reconciliation and apply both of these to our own lives in Australia today. Would not this great country of Australia be a much better land if each of us could forget our own needs and think of the needs of others? Would not our community be much better off if our leaders in every sphere of life in church, in community, in commerce and in politics were humble, selfless and inspiring, rather than to be power hungry and manipulative? Would not our country reach its great potential if we all displayed the kind of compassion the kind of love the kind of sacrificial service that Sir Edward Dunlop showed is clearly possible for each one of us?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that kind of man can come out of Sheepwash Creek, Stewarton (and how Australian that is, the man who came from Sheepwash Creek) what kind of men and women can come out of any place in Australia Wangaratta, or Bathurst, or Adelaide, or Kalgoorlie or Port Douglas? If we were prepared to use our talents and capacities for the welfare and betterment of others in this fantastic Australia that we call home.</PARA>
<PARA>I now quote from Sir Ninian Stephen:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bitterness never entered his soul, for he knew its corroding influence and forthrightly rejected it. Instead he gathered the strength to feel Christian forgiveness of the enemy, that coming to him, he said, at war's end when, seeing a wounded Japanese soldier slumped down on the floor of a railway truck full of Japanese prisoners and apparently in danger of being crushed, he went to help him up. Weary took him by the shoulders to lift him, only to find him dead. With that all hatred of the enemy died too.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a pity that Weary was not with us recently when the new Prime Minister of Japan apologised for Japanese atrocities during World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I have no doubt that Weary's name will live on. I know that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and all others will give help to the Sir Edward Dunlop Medical Research Foundation. Sir Edward believed that insufficient medical research had been devoted to the needs of ageing veterans. In his later years he made representations for further research which, in his vision, would subsequently benefit the ageing population in the community at large. This vision was taken up with the Department of Veterans' Affairs by the Veterans Affairs Coordinating Council of Organisations in Victoria, and culminated in the incorporation of the Sir Edward Dunlop Medical Research Foundation as a public company in May 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The foundation has a national role of funding research and was a joint venture between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and ex-service organisations in Victoria. While it operates independently, accommodation and administration support are provided by the department in furthering the foundation's work. The main objection of the foundation, endorsed by Sir Edward, is stated as being:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To do and undertake all things necessary for, or tending towards or likely to promote the maintenance and improvement of the medical and similar care of veterans and their dependants, their health and general welfare.</PARA>
<PARA>I support the motion and offer my sympathies and those of my family to Sir Edward's family and all their friends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the bells of St Paul's cathedral in Melbourne tolled their tribute, and the solitary lament of a Scottish piper broke the air, the Australian nation paid tribute to Sir Edward Weary Dunlop&mdash;sportsman, war surgeon, soldier, medical ambassador and special friend and advocate to Australia's POWs. There were many young people standing outside St Paul's cathedral that day, and many commentators drew attention to that fact. Jack Flannery, Weary Dunlop's driver for 43 years, was not at all surprised. Jack said that during the 43 years he drove Weary, visiting hundreds of small country towns, Weary always made a special point of stopping and talking to children. He used to tell them what it was like for him as a young boy growing up in the country. He was always interested in their hopes and aspirations and he would almost invariably turn to Jack and say, `Those children are our heritage; we must look after them'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That oft repeated statement of his gives us an insight into the thinking of this great man. He was imbued with a sense of duty and responsibility from an early age. His training as a surgeon reinforced that sense of responsibility, but it was always tempered with a sense of dignity and humanity and always with an eye to the future. It was John Kennedy who said that courage was a mixture of triumph and tragedy; that a man does what he must in spite of personal consequences and in spite of obstacles and dangers; and that courage in one person seems to inspire others and offer hope. I believe that description aptly defines the actions and strengths of Weary Dunlop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been numerous accounts of the selfless actions of Weary in saving the lives of his fellow POWs on the Burma railway: his willingness to withstand torture and gross deprivation to benefit others; his ingenuity in utilising whatever primitive materials were at hand as surgical instruments; and his tireless efforts as an advocate, not just for food and medical supplies but also for human dignity. In acknowledging these actions of Weary Dunlop and honouring him, we too honour a long line of Australian war surgeons who also displayed extraordinary courage. In order to understand what Weary himself endured, I would like to quote from his war diaries of July 1945:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They belaboured me with rifle butts, chairs, boots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eventually I was motionless beyond resistance, lying face down in the dust, conscious of broken ribs and blood from scalp wounds. I was gathered up, dazed and rubber-limbed, and trussed and roped backward kneeling with a large log between my seat and knees. As my head cleared there was intolerable pain due to rough ground pressure on the knees and the weight and pressure of the log. Breathing was sharply painful with fractured ribs, slowly the pain ceased in my legs because they had no circulation. How long to gangrene in the tropical heat?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the sun became low there was at last a final summing up. "Out of bed days after lights out, some days late to report to guard, and finally guilty of appalling, heinous insolence to guard. If we were so forgiving as to release you, would you have hard feelings against the guard?" I considered this cautiously and replied: "Hard feelings against what guard?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was apparently accepted as a more reasonable attitude. My ropes were released. Slowly, painfully, with the return of circulation, I found I could move my legs and feel my feet again. At last, a little drunkenly, I was on my feet again. I stood to attention, bowed and said: "And now if you will excuse me I shall amputate the Dutchman's arm who's been waiting all day." I was determined to show them that Australians were tough!</PARA>
<PARA>Weary's work for POWs, however, did not cease when peace was finally declared. Troops were demobbed and returned home to start afresh. The injuries sustained throughout that period, and the indelible effect of the POW camps on the minds and bodies of thousands of ex-servicemen, meant that their struggle for survival continued long after they returned to the security of their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As so many ex-servicemen have said, just as their problems continued so did Weary's work for them in trying to make governments and bureaucrats understand, whether that be in gaining medical attention or eligibility for a pension. As one old digger said to me, `He knew what we went through because he went through it too'. Weary was determined to achieve recognition for the ordinary men and women who served their country with honour but were often faced with hostility when trying to establish that they now needed assistance due to the results of the injuries they suffered in the service of their country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Weary revealed many of these experiences in his war diaries, and I think we can understand his continued sense of responsibility to those former POWs when he referred to the timeless, enduring, special brotherhood shared by all survivors of prison camps. I think it is pertinent today that two former POWs and former members of this House, Clarrie Millar and Tom Uren, have come to listen to this condolence motion. It was Indira Gandhi who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are moments in history when brooding tragedy in its dark shadows can be lightened.</PARA>
<PARA>Weary Dunlop perhaps lightened those brooding tragedies of Japanese POW camps by being an active participant in building bridges into Asia throughout his involvement in the development of Australia's role in the Colombo Plan, and was active in his role as an ambassador of Australia through exchange of knowledge and culture with Asia&mdash;in particular, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and India. He became President of the Australian-Asian Association of Victoria and led an Australian surgical team to Vietnam in 1969. Dr David Kings, Weary's personal doctor and family friend, said of his friend:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was my impression that his greatest raison d'etre in recent years was to make Australia fit in and work with Asia. He was doing that long before anyone else stood up and did it.</PARA>
<PARA>Weary Dunlop has been rightly described as an Australian hero. At a time in our history when as a nation we are examining our national identity, it is fitting that a man who put his own life at risk to protect others, who used his medical and surgical skills to repair the physical and mental damage inflicted by war, and always believed in a better future, should today be a hero for our young generation. I extend my sympathy to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I knew Weary Dunlop very slightly, although I saw him often as he sloped round the plaster of paris end of Collins Street, or in book shops, or as he drove, Fangio-like, hat pulled down to his ears, in his battered white Mercedes between Toorak Road and the city. One element was missing, I thought, in the eulogies at his state funeral in St Pauls Cathedral, eloquent and deeply felt as they were, and it was the point brought out by our former colleague Tom Uren in his tribute in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>: the model of cooperative leadership that Sir Edward Dunlop evolved at the Kintok prisoner of war camp on the Burma-Thailand railway. Under the Geneva convention, officers, medical orderlies and prisoners able to work received a small wage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Kintok camp, the bulk of allowances were paid into a central fund, which was used to buy drugs and food for the very needy and the sick. Under Colonel Dunlop's inspired leadership, the camp adopted some important principles: the fit looking after the sick, the young looking after the old and the collectivisation of incomes. It was a model of a society which worked on the principles of cooperation, mutual dependence, shared experience and respect for heroic leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The medical record, set out as appendix III of his great book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The War Diaries of Weary Dunlop</EMPHASIS>, indicates the extraordinary success of his leadership. In the table of Australian  patients admitted to his working camp hospitals&mdash;seven in all&mdash;between June 1942 and October 1943, only 83 deaths occurred out of 5,664 patients; that is less than 1.5 per cent. There would be a bigger death rate than that in some civilian hospitals. Of those 83 deaths, 63 came from a cholera outbreak. The record is quite phenomenal: less than 1.5 per cent of those people admitted. Other units with leadership of a lesser quality than Dunlop's had far higher death rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The book is a great contribution to Australian history and also to Australian literature. He refused to publish the diaries for 40 years and printed his entries as he wrote them, resisting the temptation, which all of us have from time to time, to improve the writing. I want to quote words that he wrote and Sir Laurens van der Post's words in his introduction, which epitomises his spirit. Referring to the time that they had handcarts bringing in purchases from the Chinese, Sir Laurens wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The handwagons were barely through the gates when a private rushed out of the Guardroom, halted them and declared that he would summon the Corporal of the Guard to conduct a search of our supplies. Our Chinese providers had grown so careless that we could see, through the ragged screen of fruit and vegetables, shining streaks of the deep red-brown sides of another mahogany radio cabinet. If the Japanese found, as they could not fail to, the radio among our supplies, it would mean not only the end of a vital source of food, but judging by what had happened in other camps, the execution of the people concerned in the smuggling of the radios. Weary, seeing that the Guard had his back turned to him in hurrying up to the office where the Corporal and rest of the Guard were sitting in comfort, instantly walked up to the relevant handcart and whisked out the cabinet radio. He did it as lightly and easily as if he were merely extracting a rugby football from another ruck on an international rugger ground where he had played for Australia . . . He tucked it under his arm and proceeded to walk smartly past the Guard towards the prison hospital. I followed him as fast as I could. I saw a sleepy corporal coming out of the room, stopping him, and in the rudest of Japanese demanding to know what he carried under his arm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Medical supplies,' Weary answered, with a ring of authority in his voice that was so irresistible that the moment I translated for the corporal, adding that he was the doctor in charge of the sick people in the hospital, the corporal waved us on and the incident was closed. But it could easily have been the end of Weary as well as some half dozen of the rest of us.</PARA>
<PARA>He later writes about farewelling Weary Dunlop when he left Java:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think back to that walk and that moment when Weary, undismayed and even at so gloomy an hour, extracting a laugh from his overburdened men, met us at the great gate, all the adjectives personified in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pilgrim's Progress</EMPHASIS> and so unfashionable today occur to me as the only ones precise enough for the occasion; adjectives like `valiant', `standfast', `tell-true', `great-heart' and so on, but also joined to those some not to be found in Bunyan's vocabulary,  like Weary's unfailing sense of humour and his light and classical use of irony as a means of defeating self-pity and reducing the intrusions of fate in the life of himself and of those under his command to bearable human proportions.</PARA>
<PARA>Weary Dunlop wrote about his attitude towards the Japanese and the Germans:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Japan there is much of sensitivity and creativity, but I have sensed that the single-minded loyalty gives the system some of the defects of an insect society, with a pattern of blind, unswerving acceptance of leadership whether towards good or evil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, too, marches with the Germanic brooding madness of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gotterdammerung</EMPHASIS>, `The Twilight of the Gods', with desperate overtones of self-immolation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we think of the atmospherics that would have been around in the Senate following the 1975 crisis, it is to the credit of Sir Condor Laucke that his time as President of the Senate was marked by good management, fairness and large doses of commonsense&mdash;all the qualities we would expect such a person as Sir Condor Laucke to bring to anything that he turned his hand to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Writing on his appointment as Senate President in 1976, Ian Mackay of the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> summed it up in the following terms:</PARA>

He was no longer in robust health, but he remained, as the parliament would expect, vitally interested in the affairs of this parliament and of the Senate, and well briefed on all the things that Australia was directly involved in. Invariably, when I called at Bunawunda, Sir Condor would be accompanied by his lifelong companion, Lady Rose. When I was there in April he also had grandchildren visiting with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of his achievements Sir Condor Laucke was never more at home than he was on his property, Bunawunda, in his home town of Greenock in his beloved Barossa Valley. I endorse all that has been said by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and by the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer), and all the tributes that have been paid to a man whose reputation in South Australia is for humility, integrity, dignity, honesty and trust. </PARA>

Sir Donald referred to Sir Condor's fundamental integrity and inherent courtesy, and the mutual regard that they had built up over eight years working together as Governor and Lieutenant-Governor was very evident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to take this opportunity to refer to the sermon given at that state funeral by Sir Condor's pastor, the pastor of the Greenock Lutheran Church, Pastor Lloyd Spike. All of those who were privileged to be at that service would agree that Pastor Spike conducted that state funeral with a great deal of sensitivity, so that Lady Rose and the Laucke family felt every bit as involved and part of that tribute to Sir Condor as did those who were there as dignitaries of church or state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that no 20th century figure has been as highly regarded in the Barossa Valley as Sir Condor Laucke. Their flour miller from Greenock became President of the Senate and the Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia. But for all of that, for all the deference which the people of the Barossa Valley had for Sir Condor, he remained always to them a son of the Barossa, totally approachable and someone with whom they were comfortable and at ease. The gracious way he went about being President of the Senate and being Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia affected all who met him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in his maiden speech and in his valedictory he made a great deal of the importance of Australia and of its future to him as a senator, there is no doubt that his heart was in the Barossa Valley and in his beloved Greenock. From his point of view the Barossa Valley was a promised land within a promised land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should remember this afternoon that Sir Condor Laucke, as a South Australian, conducted a very successful flour milling business; that under his watchful eye the business grew from two to five mills; that he was very proud of the fact that his son Condor Laucke stepped into his shoes in the business and that Condor has, in the last three years, developed a new mill at Greenock with all the latest computerised flour milling facilities, and that it remains the major business in that town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that, in spite of the prominence of the Laucke name and the Laucke mill in Greenock, Sir Condor remained actively involved in all of those community activities, such as the agricultural bureau, the institute committee and the church. He has already been recognised this afternoon for his involvement at Bunawunda as a wine grape grower and as a winemaker. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, as a winemaker he was one of those who helped to establish the now famous Barons of the Barossa, who are part of the opening ceremony at every vintage festival with their traditional crushing of the grapes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Condor Laucke was also a conservationist. He told the story of how Mr Seppelt, of Seppeltsfield fame, had planted the palms that many honourable members will have seen lining the roads into Seppeltsfield. He then gave Sir Condor pines to plant to line the roads into Greenock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that, important as his public life was, nothing was as important to him as the relationship he shared with Lady Rose and the development of his children, Rosemarie and Condor, and their grandchildren. I do not want to delay the House, but I want to reflect on the mark of respect that the Barossa paid to Sir Condor when, on his retirement in June 1981, over 1,300 people of the Barossa filled the cavernous&mdash;that is no overstatement&mdash;Tanunda Show Hall. Thunderous applause greeted the speech that Sir Condor gave on his retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was about Sir Condor Laucke a courtesy that was innate. People who knew him knew that he simply could not help being a gentleman. It would be unfair and derisive to say that it was as though it were genetic with him. As a stickler for precedents and convention, as underscored by the Leader of the Opposition, he would be horrified if the deference that he always showed to those of the opposite sex&mdash;by opening a door or standing up if a lady was standing in a room which he had entered&mdash;were ever interpreted as belittling because for him that deference was nothing more than elevating those for whom he had a very special regard&mdash;partially, I suspect, because he had been orphaned at an early age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That courtesy, evident in his public life and known to all of us, was equally evident in all that I saw and have heard of his private life. As has been said, that same sense of courtesy, honesty, integrity and dignity was the pillar of his parliamentary life. He served in the state parliament of South Australia from 1956 to 1965 and in the Senate from 1967 to 1981, including a period as President. Sometimes I suspect people may have seen that courtesy in Sir Condor as a sign of weakness. Frankly, having got to know him very well, I know that it was only the solidarity of his own political conviction that allowed him to be as accommodating about the points of view put to him by people from a range of other political convictions. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, his elevation to the presidency in 1976 occurred at a very difficult time, and with courage he very successfully steered the Senate through that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to quote from a brief remark made by Sir Condor when on one occasion he had to name a senator. Having named the senator, he went on to say, `I regard the institution of parliament as utterly important to society generally'. There is no doubt that for Sir Condor Laucke the institution of parliament was much more important than the philosophy of his party or any other party. As Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia he was scrupulously careful never to allow his own partisan views to intrude in anything that he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who occupy this building&mdash;he played a key role in its construction&mdash;would do well this afternoon, in paying tribute to Sir Edward Weary Dunlop and to Sir Condor Laucke, to remember that the tributes we have uttered are mere words unless these condolence motions are accompanied by a conviction on our part that the greatest attributes of Sir Edward Weary Dunlop and Sir Condor Laucke ought to be entrenched more deeply into Australian society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall speak very briefly. As one of only two members of this chamber who actually served with Sir Condor Laucke, I would be very remiss if I did not lay on the record a couple of points about him that probably are not so well known by those now serving here, the majority of whom, I believe, would have been elected to parliament since Sir Condor Laucke left it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in his tribute, quoted Sir Condor as having said that the institution is greater than the person. But, indeed, Sir Condor Laucke, by being the person that he was, made the institution of the Senate and the whole parliament that much better. In every sense of the word he was a gentle man. He was highly regarded not only by women for his chivalry, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) pointed out, but also by his male colleagues, who regarded him equally as affectionately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had meant in this speech to refer to the matter of the first naming of a senator by Sir Condor. It was certainly very firmly believed in the Senate&mdash;I do not mean to touch any raw nerves by referring to this&mdash;that he was probably the only person in the Senate who could have been its president post-1975. He was the only person in the chamber held in sufficient regard to handle that situation as he did. I remember very vividly that occasion when he was first driven to naming a senator. The standing orders and procedures of the Senate, then at least, were rather different from those of the House of Representatives. There was provision, once a senator had been named, for that senator to withdraw and apologise to the house and for the suspension motion to be withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the agonising way in which Condor Laucke begged the senator in question to withdraw and apologise after the naming and the moving of the motion, but the senator refused and the motion went ahead. At the first opportunity available to him as President of the Senate, he left the chair for some time. He was clearly so personally distressed at having been driven to that point that he was totally distracted until he was able to leave the chamber and compose himself. He was obviously very deeply hurt. Because it was so genuine senators respected that. It was not, as has been said, a sign of weakness; not at all. It was a sign of a man who cared for the institution and who really was totally dismayed and could not understand that others would not pay it the basic respect that he that day begged them to. He was a very good President. In his time as President, the disruptions and namings were very few and far between. As I have said, he was very warmly regarded by all senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other reason why I wanted to put a couple of things on the record. It is something that I think few, if any, other members of this chamber would be aware of and that is the role that he played&mdash;he took it very seriously&mdash;in relation to all members of parliament as part of his responsibilities as a presiding officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you are aware, Mr Speaker, it is traditional that the Speaker is chairman of the Joint House Committee. In those days that committee played a very active role, or tried to, in relation to the general welfare of members, not just the dining rooms, as it tends to these days. A very difficult situation arose, to the point where very few meetings of the committee were being called. Some internal politics were being played in the Joint House Department. People running it were not particularly well motivated towards members but they liked the positions they occupied and the salaries that came with those positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only thanks to Sir Condor Laucke that members got any facilities. There was a move abroad to reduce very basic facilities. I refer to such very basic things as being able to buy a breakfast in Parliament House. For many members who stay in motels or in individual accommodation, it was only because Condor Laucke was approachable on the subject of members' amenities, always took them very seriously and tried to do his best towards their basic amenities, that they were preserved. As I said, we should bear in mind that he was not chairman of the Joint House Committee and that he did this from a position of some disadvantage. But he did care about every member of parliament and he cared about their problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should like to say a brief word for Rose Laucke too. Not everybody is aware that Rose had been quite an outstanding ballerina when Condor met her. She was quite short but by the time that I met her she was not exactly sylph-like. But she was a wonderful person; she bubbled with warmth and personality. In many ways she was a great foil for Condor who was not an overly-serious man but who was a very much more reserved person than she was. She bubbled with warmth and love and they were both very warmly regarded by all who knew them. Condor clearly adored her, and she also adored `my Condor', as she used to refer to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the distance of the years&mdash;and I regret that it is a rather longer time since I have seen Condor Laucke than it is for the honourable member for Wakefield&mdash;I would like to add my tribute to a man who was an outstanding parliamentarian. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said of his quality. He was a tremendous fellow. I had a good deal to do with him in the development of what we now know as the income equalisation deposits scheme. If we look through <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, we will find that, as with drought bonds, it was one scheme that he advocated. He came from the small town of Greenock. Many of us come from rural Australia and we are conscious of the cycle of seasons. In Condor's maiden speech he urged&mdash;and subsequently as a senator and as a parliamentarian he frequently came to me to urge&mdash;the adoption of the scheme. It was partly from his advocacy, and that of some others, that the scheme which is still in place, though regrettably significantly modified, has been able to provide some help to successive generations of farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Condor has been spoken of as a flour miller, a winegrower and a winemaker. Importantly, during the time I knew him, he recognised that others did not enjoy the affluence that he was able to achieve. When he took me to the Barossa Valley I was quite fascinated to learn of the German origins of many of the settlers. He spoke very strongly of those traditions which, in their diversity, are really what this country is all about. Condor was strongly in favour of helping those small wine grape growers who, for many years in South Australia, had extraordinary difficulty surviving.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the honourable member's question, yes, of course, there has been a very significant increase in the number of international travellers coming to Australia. That is why I was surprised to read in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> the remarks of the new Chairman of the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation. While of course I hope that the Leader of the National Party of Australia might join me in congratulating Jim Kennedy on his appointment to the chair of the QTTC, and also acknowledge his past service as a board member on the ATC and the board of the QTTC, I have to take issue with Mr Kennedy's comment that, in his view, the ATC has failed to market Australia effectively overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, in 1992 we had a record 2.6 million international travellers coming to Australia. That was a 10 per cent increase on 1991 and that generated $8 billion in export earnings for Australia. This did not happen by chance and in 1991 there was a comprehensive evaluation of the marketing activities of the ATC. It found a very strong positive correlation between the markets where the ATC put in extra effort and where the extra international visitors came from. In fact, last year Australia's market share increased in over 11 countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kennedy has suggested that the effectiveness of the ATC is questionable because, in his opinion, few people in Hong Kong, Singapore or Taipei know about the Whitsundays.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They may not know about the Whitsundays, but they certainly know about Australia because, if we look at the statistics for the first five months of this year compared with those of last year, the number of tourists from Hong Kong is up 22 per cent; from Singapore, up 44 per cent; and, from Taiwan, up 70 per cent. It is through the effective international promotion of Australia by the ATC that we have been able to achieve these sorts of increases. Of course, it is always interesting to remind the opposition that it has been during the life of the Hawke and Keating governments that funding for the ATC has increased eight-fold since 1983. Funding such as that has been able to help the ATC develop tactical campaigns throughout Asia to ensure that we are getting the right sorts of media campaigns in six languages in eight leading markets throughout the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Queensland wishes to specifically promote the Whitsundays to these markets, I am sure that it will be pleased to know that this will soon be possible through a new marketing proposal known as partnership Australia, which has the strong support of the Prime Minister. Partnership Australia will encourage the states to coordinate with the ATC in tactical marketing campaigns aimed at distributing information about regions and holiday packages for not only the Whitsundays but also Far North Queensland and other parts of Australia of interest to my caucus colleagues. Partnership Australia will improve Australia's overall international marketing effort by reducing duplication and improving the effectiveness of federal and state overseas marketing campaigns. It will also ensure that we get more bang for every dollar that Australia is spending overseas promoting itself as a tourist destination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, international tourists do not recognise our state boundaries and I am concerned that we should not confuse them with some of the static that comes from competing federal, state and territory campaigns. It is for that same reason that I believe board members of the ATC should be appointed for their skills and expertise, not because of where they live. I have noticed that appointments to the QTTC have generated the same sort of geographical analysis as have appointments to the ATC and I share the view of the Queensland minister for tourism as reported in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>.

In other words, what I was promising to do was to maintain roughly those sorts of levels. I said exactly, `we roughly have at the moment'. This may be highly unsuitable to the honourable member for Mayo in trying to fabricate a false case about the government's wishes in some way to run tax up, but the fact is that the tax to GDP ratio has been coming down. Let me give some of the numbers. In 1982-83, it was 26.1 per cent; in 1983-84, it was 25.3&mdash;then 26.8, 27.2, 27.8, 27.3, 26.1, 25.9, 25.8, 24.1 and 23.6&mdash;down, down and down!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I wonder whether the honourable member for McPherson is referring to the same people the opposition proposes to tip off unemployment benefits after nine months. This Government has focused its labour market programs particularly on the long-term unemployed&mdash;those people who have been unemployed 12 months or more. They now number over 400,000 and, as honourable members will hear in tonight's budget, the government will be focusing on a very large proportion of those unemployed. A very high proportion of those long-term unemployed touched by those labour market programs will gain work experience and get back into the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A feature of this period of unemployment is that there will be a greater number of long-term unemployed than there has been in the aftermath of other recessionary cycles. That is why the government has commissioned a study&mdash;a white paper&mdash;on employment and unemployment. It will be presented later in the year and may permit us to look at novel ways in which we can seek to redress some problems associated with the unemployed&mdash;particularly the long-term unemployed&mdash;so that these people are not carrying an undue burden resulting from Australia's economic change, its restructuring and its recovery. That is why we sought in the meantime to provide adequate income support and to particularly focus labour market programs on the long-term unemployed, which they are. If, as the coalition was seeking, $10,000 million were to be cut out of outlays, those labour market programs would have been cut to pieces&mdash;as indeed they would have been under its first policy position of taking people off unemployment benefits after nine months. Opposition members are entitled to talk in this Parliament about the unemployed, but not when their social security spokesman refers to them as riffraff and not when they were not prepared to support the unemployed in labour market programs and put the kind of budgetary support behind those people that they needed.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="25" SPEAKER="Kerr The Hon D.J.C." NAMEID="RH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DENISON" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Federal Police have been involved in Cambodia since May of last year. I might remind the House of the very significant work, spearheaded in particular by Senator Gareth Evans, in terms of the settlement we have been seeking to achieve to get a peaceful resolution to that unfortunate war-torn region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first contingent of 10 officers led by Superintendent Bill Kirk was posted to Thmar Puok in north-west Cambodia in the so-called liberated zone where all the factions, including the Khmer Rouge, operate. I might say by way of explanation that in this liberated zone there are essentially four armed forces each contesting, prior to the recent period of relative peace, for control of that sector. Each had its own military forces and into that environment the Australian Federal Police and the German and Tunisian police went. It certainly was a dangerous area and all of our contingents have been on heightened levels of alert all the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Federal Police when they arrived built a police station, a training school, and accommodation and recreation facilities. I suppose, in a lighthearted way, it certainly is the only flushing toilet that exists north of Phnom Penh.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of Australian Federal Police led by Superintendent Bob Bradley took over the task in January of this year. It continued a training effort that has led to more than 400 Cambodians from all the factions, including the Khmer Rouge, being trained as police men and women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about the training that the Australians have been able to achieve is that they have been able to bring together all the different factional groups, so not only have they trained those 400 police but also they have left, after their work, some 40 Cambodians who are ready to train others to continue the process of building a local police force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great success of their work has been that, in that region at least, we got the clear indication that all the different factions were prepared to unite their police services under a common command. That was the only area which was not under the control of the central government where such an outcome was achieved, notwithstanding the best efforts of the United Nations forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, I had the very great privilege of being able to visit Thmar Puok and I saw at first-hand the work they had done. Afterwards when we came back to Phnom Penh, I was able to talk to the representatives of the Cambodian government, the UN special representative Akashi, General Sanderson and Police General Roos. They all said that the Australian Federal Police had been exceptional in their work and had been the best forces on the ground in Cambodia as part of the United Nations civilian police operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe all Australians can be very proud of the work that has been done by members of the Australian Federal Police. The Cambodian minister for justice said to me that they are now a permanent part of his country's history. I am sure that all members of the House would like to extend their congratulations to the Australian Federal Police for the hard work they have done under difficult conditions in the interests of our country.</PARA>

There will be a further discussion about these matters in cabinet shortly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank perhaps my most distinguished predecessor in this portfolio for a question which has indeed been brought to my attention and I welcome the opportunity to respond to the criticisms which Russell Rollason and others in the NGO community have made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not the case that the aid program which Australia maintains has fallen prey to, or been captured by, commercial interests. We do have a very significant development cooperation program&mdash;just how significant honourable members will find out tonight when it is revealed how well, in difficult times, the government has maintained its aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its motive is to improve the living standards in developing countries&mdash;particularly those in our own region. It is motivated primarily by the very real desire of all Australians to help improve the quality of life of people who are much less well off than ourselves. Those humanitarian motives are the main motivation for our aid program and without those motives the program would not exist. But we also recognise that in serving those fundamental humanitarian objectives, the aid program provides opportunities for us to advance Australia's foreign policy interests and our trade interests. We would be letting down the Australian taxpayers, who after all pay the bills for this program, if we simply ignored those opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I make no apology for the fact that nearly 90 per cent of Australia's aid is spent on goods and services which are sourced in Australia. I make no apology to the wheat farmers of New South Wales, Victoria or South Australia for the fact that the food aid which we supply under the world food program is bought from them at a benefit to the average wheat farmer of over $800 a year. I make no apology to the rice growers of the Riverina or Leeton that our rice under the world food program is purchased from them at an average benefit per rice farmer of around $4,000. I make no apology for the fact that the steel we use in the bridges that we supply to Indonesia is made at Port Kembla or Whyalla and fabricated by workers in Seven Hills or indeed, Mr Speaker, in your own electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no apology for the fact that the engineers who go to work on these projects are trained in Australia. I make no apology for the fact that the nurses or the teachers are Australians who are serving their country in this way and, indeed, I make no apology for the fact that the thousands of students we train in Australia are trained in institutions which are as good as, or better than, any in the world.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. I welcome the interjection from the Leader of the National Party of Australia. The fact that we spend money on Australian products does not make it bad aid, as is often implied. The fact is that by specialising in areas where we have a comparative advantage, where we are world leaders&mdash;and those areas are becoming more and more&mdash;we do advance and maximise the value of our aid while generating production and jobs back home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that the aid program is insufficiently focused on poverty alleviation is based on a very static, very narrow and, I believe, false definition of poverty alleviation. The fact is that sustainable economic growth is a prerequisite for economic development. It is not enough on its own, but it is essential if countries are to provide ongoing improvements in employment, health care and education&mdash;the very means of alleviating poverty. That will not happen unless there is sustainable growth. Aid simply patches up the problems and does not deal with the real issues. That is why, under our aid program, we support the construction of transport and communications facilities in Indo-China, or China, as well as village water supply systems in East Timor. It means that we build bridges in Indonesia, but we support family planning programs in the South Pacific as well. Both sorts of activities are part of any balanced aid program and will continue to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have learned anything from the last few decades it is that in the medium term the best way of improving the quality of life for people in developing countries is to give them the opportunity to help themselves. That is what we are all about. If, in the process, we can bring benefits to Australia as well, then the program is twice as useful.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This document continues the practice of presenting to the House of Representatives at approximately six-monthly intervals a schedule listing Government responses to House and joint committee reports as well as responses which remain outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practice of presenting this schedule to the House follows the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 25 May 1978 Prime Minister Fraser informed the House that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the incoming government. The Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983, at which time the ministerial statement method of response was continued. More recently, the Government has advised that responses to committee reports will be made by means of a letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. However, for the purposes of this schedule, the date of the presentation of the Government's response to the Parliament has been taken as the date of the Government's response, not the date of any correspondence with the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The schedule does not include reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, or the reports of the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes, which are tabled by the Committee. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dame Marie Breen had a distinguished career in the Senate. As a member of my electorate, I saw her on a number of occasions, lastly when she attended the victory of the Liberal Party in Goldstein on 13 March. At her funeral service there were so many people that the crowd spilled out onto the footpath, such was the tremendous regard in which Dame Marie was held by all who knew her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Marie was asked by the Victorian Liberals to stand for parliament in 1961. She was known then for a wonderful record of community service. She was an executive member of the Victorian Baby Health Centres Association for some 36 years. From 1946 she held a number of positions in the National Council of Women, including the offices of Victorian President and National Vice-President. She played significant roles in the establishment of the Marriage Guidance Council in Victoria and the Victorian Family Council. The Family Council specifically set out to assist low income families and to provide playground facilities for children in high-rise accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The auxiliaries of the Royal Melbourne Hospital, the Southern Memorial Hospital and Hampton Rehabilitation Hospital all benefited from her work. She was mayoress of Brighton during her husband's term of office in 1941-42. Dame Marie believed that women had an important role to play in the nation's politics. She was actively involved in the Australian Women's National League from 1936. The AWNL was one of the organisations which came together to form the modern Liberal Party. She held a number of positions in the women's sections of the party, including chairman of the federal women's committee. It was due to outstanding women such as Dame Marie that the Liberal Party led the way in endorsing women for parliament. In the early 1960s, of five women in the parliament, four were Liberals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Marie was also instrumental in the establishment of the Citizens Advice Bureau, and she was a supporter of the establishment of an institute of family studies. Her outstanding record of voluntary community service had the family as its focus, and this arose out of Dame Marie's own background of a happy, stable and devoted family life. She had been raised in a close and happy family, and family and Christian values remained of overriding importance to her throughout her life. She never forgot her family, and it was to care for her husband who had been severely injured in an accident that she was later to resign from the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1958 Dame Marie was awarded an OBE, and in 1979 she was made a Dame of the British Empire. Within the Liberal Party she held many positions. She was state Vice-President from 1955 to 1961. Dame Marie was a wonderfully talented person with wide-ranging interests. Like Sir Edward Dunlop, she saw the very great value and importance to Australia of building our relations with Asia, and she visited many countries in the region. She was Vice-President of the Australia-Asia Association. She had a lifelong interest in music, opera and ballet. She sang with her daughter Jeanette in the Brighton philharmonic choir, and even had a season in the chorus of the National Opera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Marie embodied the finest values for which the Liberal Party stood and stands today&mdash;a belief in the pre-eminence of the family as the source of personal strength and respect for others, a strong commitment to helping others through voluntary community action, a preparedness to make personal sacrifices for the public interest and an acceptance of the importance of a strong moral basis for individual, community and political life. From her individual strength and achievement the whole of Australia benefited. I am very pleased and proud to have this opportunity to acknowledge her contribution to the House, and to give my condolences to her family. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . you could only get 750 to 1 on the immediate discovery of the Loch Ness Monster.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have it here; I will read it in a moment. The minister and his government have effectively given up on unemployment. They have thrown their hands up in the air and said, `We haven't got a clue'. It is interesting to contrast that with some of the comments that were made before the election. On 12 February the Prime Minister, on a radio program in Queensland, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . unemployment probably has peaked and may be now coming off, coming down.</PARA>
<PARA>Two days later in the first great debate he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're seeing now job growth coming through. I think we're on the cusp of a significant recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident it's (unemployment) peaked and it's on its way down.</PARA>
<PARA>That contrasts interestingly with his comments to his staff, not meant for publication, the night before the election when he boasted that unemployment had been neutralised as an election issue. I am sure the 924,000 Australians who are unemployed will be pleased to know that they have been neutralised and that the Prime Minister has the attitude that if he can get them off the agenda they do not matter. But there was every reason to think that they had to be addressed. Even the government's own adviser Bruce Chapman from the ANU, over 12 months ago, in a report that he wrote, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current state of the Australian labour market augurs poorly for those already disadvantaged in the labour force, of which there are, and continue to be, very many. Our estimates and projections imply strongly the number of long term unemployed will be, by a large margin, at unprecedented and still growing levels over the next two years. There is not, now, any chance of avoiding this.</PARA>
<PARA>A significant aspect of that is that there is not now any chance of avoiding it, but there was, and always was, if there had been some action and not merely rhetoric. At the end of June at the National Press Club the minister made a speech in which he candidly and honestly addressed the problems of unemployment. It is a pity that same candour and honesty could not have been shown before the election. There were comments such as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our goal is to reduce unemployment as far as we can during the period of economic growth. To do so we should take every step, no matter how small, which can have a net positive impact on jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>Those sorts of comments are right through the speech. Another comment was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should not despair at the magnitude of the task. Every tenth of a percentage point off the unemployment rate is another 9,000 people, real people, with real families, back in work&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>unless, of course, the participation rate is jumping around. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No level of unemployment that we are likely to see in the near future could be regarded as satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our commitment, as a government and as a nation, should not be to any arbitrary unemployment number or rate. Our commitment must be to the reduction of unemployment as rapidly and as completely as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>The trouble with all of this is that it is just rhetoric; there is no substance. Who has been here for 10 years? Who has been around and running the place? All of a sudden it is though it is a problem we have only now discovered. The Prime Minister has got in on the act. At his Evatt Foundation lecture he made similar bleating noises about unemployment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal aim of this government will be to reduce the number of unemployed Australians. And so long as there is a pool of unemployed, of whatever dimension, the aim must be to decrease the amount of time people are spending in it.</PARA>
<PARA>Fine. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will need from all the players in the employment equation recognition of our profound responsibility, not only to the unemployed and those facing unemployment, but to Australia as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA>Where is the policy to go with the rhetoric? It simply does not exist. It is simply all talk. It is simply part of a strategy to neutralise unemployment for another two years. The Prime Minister's best comment in that speech came late in it when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tonight I have said very little about the economic future. I could quote you the evidence, the unmistakable evidence of the sea-change which has occurred in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the vision of the Prime Minister, but his vision is very narrow. His vision does not extend to the people who have been displaced by his 10 years as Treasurer or Prime Minister. His vision is very myopic. His vision could use glasses, but he had better get them today because he will not be able to get a rebate for them after tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His vision does not include people such as Norma who were talked about in the Salvation Army annual report that came out a little while ago. Norma is a long-time unemployed person. This is how the Salvation Army describes her in its annual report to try to put a face to the 924,000 people unemployed or the over 350,000 long-term unemployed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Norma Banks is a warm, gregarious 50 year old, who lives by herself in a privately rented flat in an inner Melbourne suburb. Twelve months ago she was retrenched from a large printing company: she had worked for them for 21 years.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They came along last October 12 months. We knew there were cuts going on. And they offered a voluntary redundancy package to 147 over the age of 47. We could see what was going to happen if you didn't fit into the restructure. We could see they would turn around and say "we don't need you, you're gone". So I got out before I was demoralised and told "right, you're out the door".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .      . . .       . . .</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I loved my job. I loved the people, I'm a people person. It was a family. It was life. I thought I was secure, had a job for life. And then "bang" you're out of it. You're out of the contact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first months after her retrenchment Norma decided not to immediately look for another job. "I gave myself a bit of a break. It was an unwinding period. I gave myself a bit of space".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in the last nine months she has been actively looking for work&mdash;regularly visiting the CES and checking newspaper advertisements. Not only has Norma found a scarcity of work, "You go into the CES and there's not a job you could do on the board", she has also found that employers are loath to employ older workers.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">You get to phone basis and they ask how old you are and you say 50 and they say we really need someone a bit younger. They think 50 plus is over the hill.</PARA>
<PARA>That is part of the social dimension of what unemployment and long-term unemployment is doing to Australia. It is well known to people who sit over that side. In 1980, the Prime Minister, then a shadow minister, made this statement in the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will not tell us where it will supply some jobs in the cities of Australia. This is a very urbanised country and the Government does not have a policy for providing employment where it matters. If honourable members opposite think that the Baader-Meinhof groups and the urban guerrillas in western Europe will not be a feature of Australia as we move through the 1980s with high levels of unemployment in the cities, I think they may be disappointed.</PARA>
<PARA>Today we have Mr Baader-Meinhof occupying the Prime Minister's chair. The social dimension of the problem he has created is worth repeating. Today almost 700,000 Australian kids are growing up in homes where no parent has a job. Almost one in five children aged 14 and under live in homes where no parent has a job. Almost 300,000 kids are living in homes where the family breadwinner is unemployed. One in nine Australian workers are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bishop Challen from the Brotherhood of St Laurence has warned that we face a real risk of workers over 40 years of age never again being able to find work. This parliament's Senate issued a report stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a real possibility that many of the young people now unemployed will never work. Many of them will be the second generation in their families cut off from the benefits bestowed by full-time jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>In its medium term review of the economy, EPAC recently forecast single income families as falling behind dual income families and likely to lag further through this decade. That is what is happening with income distribution in Australia. The fact is that Australia is a much more unfair and uneven society today than it was 10 years ago at the end of the last recession. This was put very well by Max Walsh who recently wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the well-known expression "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer", life for most of the last 40 odd years hasn't worked that way in Australia. The fruits of growth, especially as measured in terms of the wages, were for the most part skewed favourably towards the lower-income groups. However under a Labor Government, this egalitarian trend has gone into reverse. For Australian wage-earners over the past decade, the rich have got richer and the poor, poorer.</PARA>
<PARA>The figures Max was talking about relate to the fact that 10 years ago the top one per cent of wealth was owned by the same number of people who made up the bottom 10 per cent of the Australian population. Today, one per cent of the population owns as much as the bottom 23 per cent. He commented on that as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suspect that most members of our Labor Government will be rather shocked to find that under their administration the gap between the lower and higher-paid people in our society has not only widened but that the poorest have gone backwards.</PARA>
<PARA>That cannot be explained by the recession. That is comparing us with the end of the last recession. The Salvation Army annual report makes chilling reading. Last year a record 1 1/2 million in a country of 17 million people sought help from the Salvos. It was predicted that 40,000 single adults and families would be homeless in the next 12 months because of unemployment. The report said that cash and food vouchers were often fully used within the first two hours of opening in Melbourne each day and that there were alarming levels of sexual abuse and domestic violence. These were the biggest causes of the increase in youth homelessness. One of the strongest conclusions of the report was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While economic restructuring might offer stimulating challenges to governments and the business community, it has been a crippling experience for displaced workers, their families and communities. It results in diminished control over our lives and is causing a political backlash as resentment increases.</PARA>
<PARA>So what is the response? The response is simply all talk. The minister interjected earlier and suggested that I read his speech. I will read out some parts of it. Towards the end, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So far I have talked about policies to encourage growth and remove barriers in the labour market . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to look critically . . . at the non-economic restrictions on business.</PARA>
<PARA>He said we need to look critically at on-costs and regulations. He said, `We need, we need'. Of course we need! What we really need is some action. We need to stop talking and actually do something in this country. At another point in his speech was his rhetoric about solving unemployment&mdash;but again it is just rhetoric. We come back to the need for strategies that maximise stable and sustainable economic and employment growth and that act directly to reduce the numbers of the long-term unemployed. That is fine, but where has he been for 10 years? Where was he 12 months ago when Bruce Chapman was saying there was a problem?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech, he also commented that these lessons point to two overall policy priorities&mdash;to `maximise stable and sustainable economic growth' and to `act directly to reduce the numbers of long-term unemployed'. They are fine sentiments; but how do we do it? He can keep talking about it for only so long. The response of the government so far has been twofold: talk, talk, talk; and, when talk runs a bit thin, report, reports, reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report is coming back to us in July next year. The government's republican advisory committee can advise in a matter of months; the committee to advise on unemployment takes 13 or 14 months. That is far better timing for an election than a short-term republican committee. In the end, in the words of the minister, `Where to from here?'. It is fairly simple: face up to the responsibilities, stop talking, do something and actually offer some hope. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) that he chooses effectively to debate this very important issue in such undergraduate terms. Part of the problem of an undergraduate debating society in this area is that it is almost invariably part of the characteristic of those who take a particular side in an undergraduate debate that they are unaware of the implications of their overall policy stances; and often how inappropriate it is, given those policy stances, that they cite the facts that they do to support their argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing could have been more evident in the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition than that. He introduced a report lamenting what he said was a suppression, a lowering, of incomes of low paid workers. The entirety of opposition wages policy has been directed towards lowering that further. In so far as the opposition has any labour market policies at all, in getting people back into the work force, it would have people who are unemployed directly replacing low paid workers with people operating with a 25 per cent reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He goes on to quote from a report by the Salvation Army, lamenting rightly that there are substantial casualties of economic restructuring. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) says repeatedly in public forums, `The government's economic restructuring is too slow'. He cites that as an argument that ought to be made for his position against the government. He demands that the government, which is required to give serious detailed thought to the problems which confront it, comes forward with solutions, as he termed it, yet when opposition members themselves have been questioned, albeit in the run-up to an election when one would have thought they might have tried to come up with at least a few answers, they have come forward with nothing. His leader, just before Christmas last year, was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At what point in your first term do you think you will start to make inroads into the unemployment rate?</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't know where we will be. I will be happy to give you the predictions when we get there . </PARA>
<PARA>So there is not any noticeable improvement in the first 12 months. The interviewer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are you prepared to countenance that you might actually see a rise in the unemployment rate in the first 12 months?</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I mean I'm happy to tell you that when I know.</PARA>
<PARA>He gives the government no latitude to sit down and seriously think through an issue with substantial long-term implications. About his education policies, which presumably also include his labour market policies, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal opposition would retain its existing policy on education until a wide ranging review could take place.</PARA>
<PARA>No date was put on for that operation. The fact is that the federal government has a response. That response is to go right to the heart of the problems that will emerge in the area of unemployment. We have to face certain facts about it. I think we are at a stage of the election cycle when we can probably have a sensible debate and discussion between us on unemployment; so I will stop making the same undergraduate points about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that he managed to make for 15 minutes about me since there are serious matters here for both sides of this House to deliberate on if we are to stop the sorts of social costs that he talked about and that I have talked about in the two speeches I have made. By the way, in those speeches I did not at any point say that the long-term unemployed had a better chance of seeing Nessie than of getting a job. There is absolutely no juxtaposition of those two propositions in the course of my remarks, although some journalist seems to have seen his way clear to finding that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to start to take a look&mdash;not just start because we have been taking a look at it for some time and doing something about it&mdash;at the central problem in the nature of the economy, which is not unique to Australia but a phenomenon being experienced by the entire OECD at the moment. In each recession that we have had over the last 20 years the level of long-term unemployment has plateaued higher and higher. After each recession larger and larger numbers of Australians, Britons, Americans, Canadians and Europeans have found themselves unemployed and in the position where they will never get back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could have had two or three times the average job growth of the OECD over the previous 10 years with 1.6 million new jobs in this country but we would have found a reduction in the unemployment numbers through that 10 years heyday of only some 300,000. In other words, of those 1.6 million jobs, 1.3 million were new people joining the work force. Even on the most optimistic predictions for the next seven or eight years, something like that phenomenon will occur again. There will be a very substantial number of people finding work, but they will be new entrants to the work force, newly trained people, who had previously not considered entering the work force and had now decided to do so. The long-term unemployed will find themselves increasingly uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people enter the work force through a personal network. People every day, even in the depth of a recession, find new jobs and change jobs, not in simply ones and twos but in hundreds and thousands. Enormous changes are going on in the work force all the time. The vast bulk of people are finding those working opportunities basically through the networks that they have established personally&mdash;for example, they know somebody who has a job on offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But for those who do not make it, for those whose networks fall down, as time goes by their employability dramatically reduces to the point where, unless they are being serviced by either an active program from the CES or a labour market program associated with it, they will not get a job at all. One of the problems the honourable member for Chisholm needs to think about as he sits down and contemplates his own policies, because he has an obligation to develop his party policy, is this: the Liberal Party went into the last election campaign with proposals for dramatic cuts in labour market spending. And I saw some totally ignorant remarks of its finance spokesman today, urging further cuts in our labour market programs on the rumour that there may be additional expenditure in that area. He needs to understand this and he needs to get it into his skull and particularly into his heart: if someone does not get access to one of these programs, if he or she is a long-term unemployed person, he or she will not get into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a question that that person might not get into the work force; that person will not get into the work force. Basically, all the people who are long-term unemployed who found work over the last couple of years had been through some part of those labour market programs or had been through the CES as a product of their activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take it a point further: we are the object of criticism in the media because our comparative expenditures on labour market programs compared to an OECD average as a percentage of GDP is much lower than the OECD average. That is basically correct. Not as correct as those statistics would indicate because they are taken at a point a little too early, and our spending on labour market programs has more than doubled in the last couple of years, and they took it at a point early. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even with that doubling, that still is a correct point. It is not a correct point in the percentage of unemployed served by labour market programs&mdash;percentages of unemployed served in Australia in comparison to the rest in the OECD are about the same. But our labour market programs on the whole tend to be very much cheaper than the programs that exist in the OECD, and those programs in the OECD are very expensive ones indeed. So we do serve as many unemployed people as does the OECD but not with the same level of generosity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I want to make another point to the Liberal Party members about this and to get it into their skulls, hearts and minds: they are now, outside the United States, the only conservative party in the world which opposes labour market programs and the associated training arrangements. It was a pleasure for me to go to the United Kingdom and at least see operating on the European social fund a conservative party making an attempt to make those programs within their own light, to make sense in a way that was acceptable to them in the framework of their own ideology. And one or two of their programs were working very well indeed. I am interested in them, and we will have a look at those successful programs for implementation over here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fact of the matter is that it is the British tories, the Thatcherites, who are operating extensive labour market programs, which the Liberal Party wishes to cut in order to provide what it called its particular tax breaks in the course of the last election campaign&mdash;policy which the Liberal Party has not revised. This is its position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now a great deal of literature, a great deal of understanding about the utter significance of this in transforming the lives of people who have become disconnected from the work force. It is getting the right mix of those which will be absolutely essential to getting people back to work. Those sorts of levels of unemployment that we have been discussing, that the honourable member for Chisholm has mentioned and that I have mentioned both today and in those couple of speeches, will not be resolved simply by the ordinary workings of the labour market in an economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is amongst the conservatives now almost a meeting of mind with the radicals, the most bleeding hearts and the economic rationalists, who get together amongst those who know what policies it is that they are handling. And those do not conceivably include the conservatives on the opposition benches because the conservatives know how inefficient it is for a labour market in the unemployed sector not to be competitive with those in the work force. But we can get the phenomena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw anecdotal evidence of it in Britain when I was there a couple of weeks ago because in one of the newspapers it appeared at the same time. With an unemployment level in practical terms much heavier than ours and a regional unemployment level much more atrocious than the sorts of regional problems that we confront in Australia, an employer was in the process of laying off people but was talking about the annual wage rise for British workers. He said, `It is tough here. People are being laid off. There are very difficult circumstances. We can only afford a wage rise of 5 per cent'&mdash;a wage rise of 5 per cent in the midst of that situation which he was confronting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in the United Kingdom the time previously, the railway workers had successfully secured for themselves an 11 per cent rise a year or two previously in the sort of atmosphere in which they operated. Because the fact of the matter was, and the fact of the matter is now, that one can have massive areas of unemployment, regions of unemployment, but it has no impact in exercising any set of discipline on wage levels and inflation rates in the economy as a whole simply because those workers are no longer capable of entering any competitive arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Liberal Party is worried about the positions of middle-aged men&mdash;those who are regarded as too old for a job&mdash;it has to go straight to the heart of these things and understand that these problems are not solved by people sitting around on their butts talking about changes in the structure of the work force helping the unemployed. Changes in the structure of the work force do not mean a damn to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party will not solve these problems by sitting around saying, `If we get massive growth rates that alone will achieve the objective'. If one does not get growth rates, of course one will not get unemployment coming down. But having got unemployment coming down, basically all one will address is those areas of the labour market which most readily churn, that is, those in employment or those newly trained. There will be absolutely no chance that people will find themselves in a situation where they will get into work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contemplate the fact that, unless a person is in one of our labour market programs, he or she has absolutely no chance of success, and then look at what those programs achieve because I think we have a more and varied labour market program than most. On the latest figures available to me, of those who found themselves in unsubsidised work or training after three months of receiving one of our programs, of those in Jobstart, 60 per cent were still effectively in work; Jobtrain, 38 per cent; special intervention program, 42 per cent; Job Search training, 43 per cent; mobility assistance scheme, 81 per cent; accredited training for youth, 44 per cent; Skillshare, 42 per cent; Jobskills, 44 per cent; and the other smaller labour market programs, 40 per cent&mdash;total, 45.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be great if it were 100 per cent; there is no question about that. But at the moment, for those who are not in those programs, it is 100 per cent failure. So these labour market programs are getting people at their point of need&mdash;these programs which the Liberal Party's finance spokesman dismisses this morning, without alternatives, as something that ought not to be an opportunity given to our work force who find themselves unemployed. Before he rocks into this place again he should do a bit of thinking. It ain't no good producing comments from the Salvation Army or from the Anglican welfare organisations or from anyone else whose comments are a condemnation of the direction of the Liberal Party's whole unamended program and using that as a point of criticism on us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members should not come into this place saying that we are doing nothing, when at the same time their spokesman is attacking us for doing the very things that are so successful and which I have referred to. They should come up with a few alternatives. I am prepared to listen to the British tories on one or two alternatives, so in principle I ought to at least be prepared to listen to them. But they had better have a few alternatives because they have not shown us a darn thing yet in any of the propositions they have put forward. So they should not go around the country trying to exploit this issue. It is three years off an election anyway; it will not do them any good. They should come in here with a few solutions and work with us because we are trying to work it out. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight we will see exactly what is going on with this country. The budget will certainly contain some goodies, but what is given with one hand will be more than taken with the other. That is not going to help our job prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training mentioned all the different government programs under a number of acronyms. People come to my office every day and say, `I am on this program', `I am on that program', or some other program. I congratulate the people who find work through those programs, and the businesses that succeed despite the government. But if the government were doing something to reconstruct the whole system, people could get jobs. The government would not need the socialist approach of using taxpayer's money to try to find work for the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private sector creates the only real jobs in Australia. During the election campaign I spoke to the operators of businesses and the story was the same everywhere I went, `Look, Noel, we are getting older. We are working harder than we have ever worked in our lives. We would like to sell our business or let our children take it over. But, of course, we can't. The business is our superannuation. We cannot sell it because of the recession. The only way we are going to get out of this business is in a pine box'. That is a terrible attitude, but that is the way things are going in this country today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the government help? It says, `We have all these wonderful programs'. The government can put a bandaid on the problem to try to help the situation, but we still have the additional costs and burdens of the superannuation guarantee levy, the fringe benefits tax, payroll tax&mdash;for which we said we would compensate the state governments&mdash;and the fuel levy. Until these are removed businesses are not going to employ anyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a rumour going around town that the government is going to put a tax on leaded fuel. The claim is that it is to help the environment, but we all know that its purpose is to increase government revenue. When this government says that it is trying to assist the situation, why does it always impose a penalty, instead of giving people incentives?  Business people and workers want incentives. They do not want to be told they cannot do something, otherwise they will be punished. The government should have realised this by now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fuel levy will greatly affect my electorate of Riverina because everything is trucked in and everything is trucked out. Young people going to school will be affected. The people who will have to pay for the fuel levy will be those who can least afford it. Why does the government not do something about macro-economic reform and micro-economic reform? Why does it not do something about the car industry so that people do not have to drive around Australia in cars which are 10 to 12 years old and which do not have all these pollution corrections on them? Let us boost the car industry so that people can afford these cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent a rural electorate where unemployment continues to bump along&mdash;it is getting worse as the days go by&mdash;despite the fact that Riverina is one of the wealthiest producing electorates in Australia. Commodity prices are down. Government costs and charges continue to rise. One has only to look at inspection charges. One of my constituents is an exporter. It costs him $86 for a half-hour inspection of one container. How can we compete with overseas countries with charges like that? If he has to catch a ship on the weekend, it costs $308 an hour to inspect a container. Is this madness, or is it madness? This is crazy business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about these labour creation programs with their various acronyms, instead of doing something about the real problems that face Australia. Our geographical situation and our competitiveness demand that we have to be a lean and mean machine. To do that we have to be not only as good as, but better than other nations. We talk about the OECD, but we have to do it ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is having a dramatic effect on the community. Young people cannot find work. If young people cannot find work they get into the habit of not getting up and of being lethargic. What happens then? They are in the system. I feel so sorry for those young people. I feel even more sorry for the older people. People of about my age, or younger, have their youngsters going to school and they have all those additional costs. They can no longer afford to send their children to the school of their choice. They find themselves almost on the scrap heap. They feel that no-one wants them and that they are no use to anyone. There are other associated problems. </PARA>

A lady in my electorate has a single income family receiving $404 a week. She wrote to me and listed all her costs and charges. There is no way that that family can survive.

The family has to break up and the mother has to become a single supporting mother, or the father has to go on the dole and the teenager has to go on one of these social security programs where a flat is provided at the expense of the taxpayer. That is a terrible situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope tonight's budget imposes no additional taxes on the citrus or the wine industries. The wine industry is an Australian success story, but it appears that the government does not really like success stories; it likes to slow them down and give them some hurdles to jump over and make it tough for them so that they too can put people out of work. The citrus industry is already going through a trauma. The government should be ashamed if there is a tax on the citrus industry. Recently we were going to have a protest rally in front of Parliament House, but the situation is so bad in Australia today that the farmers cannot even afford to get down here for a protest rally.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is my task to rise today to oppose this matter of public importance introduced by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge). It is absolutely amazing that the opposition can come into this House and lambast the government for a lack of policy in this area. The government has a very clear policy and a very clear commitment: to generate jobs and to do something substantial about unemployment in the long term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the case with the opposition. What have we had from the opposition in recent times since the election? Its only priorities are: who is going to be the leader of the Liberal Party, and who is going to be the President of the Liberal Party. It is not talking about ideas in the way that this government is talking about ideas. It is not talking about the ideas that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) was talking about, and it has not been talking about the ideas that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has a very serious approach in place, and that is the white paper on employment. That white paper on employment will be every bit as significant as the Chifley white paper on employment in 1945. It will bring forward a new approach to this problem, and it will build on the achievements of this government during its 10 years in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we hear from the Liberal Party and the National Party? We hear about Hewson, we hear about Reith, we hear about Howard, we hear about Goldsworthy&mdash;we hear about all the personalities fighting. Who cares who is President of the Liberal Party? The unemployed do not care who is President of the Liberal Party and, frankly, they do not care who is leader of the Liberal Party either because neither of them is talking about the ideas that are so important to the future of this country. Fair dinkum, we might as well have Marcel Marceau on the other side of the House because there is nothing emerging&mdash;no ideas are emerging from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the opposition come in here and talk about the social problems of unemployment. We share those concerns, and that is why we have commissioned the white paper on employment. That is why the minister for employment has been giving the speeches he has given. That is why the Prime Minister is doing the same thing. But what do we get from the Liberal Party? Let us look at some honest assessments of the policy approach and ideas of the Liberal Party. Let us look at what Chris Puplick had to say about the Liberal Party. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party is a dangerously narrow church.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said that `entry to the party had to stop being a test of ideological purity and should only be a question of talent and merit'. What did Malcolm Fraser have to say about ideas in the Liberal Party? Only recently, on 9 July, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Malcolm Fraser last night launched a blistering attack on the economic rationalism of the Liberal Party before members of the Australian Liberal Students Federation in Melbourne. Mr Fraser said its proponents had marginalised the Liberal Party with `stupid and mad ideas'.</PARA>
<PARA>The ideas that remain in the Liberal and National parties are indeed that. If we look at Fightback and what it had to say about unemployment, they are indeed stupid and mad ideas&mdash;dangerous ideas&mdash;because what the opposition proposed in Fightback, what it has not repudiated here today or at any stage since the election, is its approach of massive cuts to public expenditure, massive cuts to labour market programs, abolition of the CES, abolition of the award system, and hourly rates of pay of $3 for young people. That is the opposition's solution to this problem, and that has not been repudiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important thing, as the minister for employment said in this House a short time ago, is that even in Thatcher's Britain that way of thinking has now been repudiated. Even the Conservatives in Great Britain now realise that governments have to intervene. They have to intervene through bodies such as the CES, which the opposition proposes to abolish. They have to intervene through labour market programs, which were earlier rubbished by a member of the National Party.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Fightback, the opposition proposed to cut expenditure on labour market programs by something like $400 million to $500 million. As the minister for employment said earlier, for the long-term unemployed there is no alternative to those labour market programs. The CES is their only friend. What did the opposition put in Fightback that it has not repudiated? The opposition still proposes to abolish the CES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the opposition wants a serious debate about the future of employment in this country, it should come up with some ideas. It should look at the sort of thinking that is going on overseas and support the government in this white paper process. It should get involved for the future of this country. It should help us produce a white paper which can radically change our approach to these issues because they are not the same issues they were a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the opposition is that it has not changed its thinking. There are no ideas. I refer the opposition to what is being said overseas on this question. I might remind honourable members opposite that there are plenty of OECD reports in this area. For example, I will shortly quote from a recent English textbook which now acknowledges that unemployment is of itself an impediment to economic recovery. That is why governments must intervene and spend money on labour market programs if they hope to do something about the problem in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government does not pretend, and did not pretend during the election campaign, that there was any magic wand that we could wave. We acknowledge that the only path for this country to take is to make ourselves more internationally competitive, to export more and to generate jobs in the private sector. The fact of the matter is&mdash;the opposition is ignorant of this fact&mdash;that even if we get substantial growth going for the rest of this century, we will still be left with a significant number of long-term unemployed. That is what honourable members opposite fail to acknowledge. A recent English text on unemployment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployment is a major source of human misery. Despite economic growth it is a bigger problem now in the last 50 years. In western Europe three times more people are out of work than in the 1960s and the numbers in eastern Europe are rising rapidly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it has become more and more obvious that the average level itself varies greatly between decades, with previous unemployment exerting a persistent effect on subsequent unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>Governments throughout western Europe have recognised that fact. That is why they have committed themselves to creating active labour market programs, to stimulating the economy through budget deficits, and to intervening in the market through bodies such as the Commonwealth Employment Service in order to assist the innocent victims of structural and technological change. What we now have is a fundamental, structural change in our work force with rising participation rates, which means that growth cannot cater for all those who want to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House say that it must remain our aim to provide work for all of those who wish to work. When we cannot do it because of the ongoing effect of the recession and when we cannot do it because of rapid technological and structural change, then we as a government and a community have a responsibility to intervene. It is precisely that responsibility which is recognised in the United States of America and Britain, but there is only one group left in the western world that does not recognise it&mdash;the Liberal-National parties in Australia. They are bereft of ideas in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite their members to come with us on an adventure, to think for a change and to get involved with the white paper process. I invite them to come along and participate, to work with their communities, because the community now understands that this is a long-term problem which requires long-term solutions and new approaches. The government says that openly;  it does not seek to hide it. We say that openly, but the opposition pretends that nothing has changed. </PARA>

It would probably be very refreshing for the Liberal Party if Malcolm Fraser were to be elected president because he might be able to convince it that there is a need in this community for new ideas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives effect to a revised Murray-Darling Basin agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia for the improved management of the land, water and environmental resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. As of July 1992, the agreement has been operating in principle pending passage of this legislation; so it has certainly been travelling for the last 12 months and one month in principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revised agreement incorporates a salinity and drainage strategy which addresses the dual problems of the River Murray&mdash;salinity and waterlogging&mdash;and land salination in the upper Murray. The amended agreement provides for water allocation through a system of continuous water accounting. This will allow New South Wales and Victoria to draw on their annual water allocation according to need. Unused allocations will be carried forward as credits. Above allocation drawings will be carried forward as debits against future entitlements. It is believed that this will facilitate the optimal use of a shared resource without disruption of fundamental access guarantees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives the commission more financial flexibility by allowing the commission, with council approval, to carry over limited funds from one year to the next. Finally&mdash;and this is of particular interest to me&mdash;following the successful passage of this bill the first schedule to be brought forward for approval will be one authorising the assent of Queensland to the agreement. Practically the entire area that is affected by this bill lies within my electorate of Maranoa; in fact, only the city of Toowoomba, which is in the electorate of Groom, lies outside the electorate of Maranoa. So the passage of this bill is of particular interest to me. </PARA>

Also at issue is the election pledge&mdash;I am not quite sure whether it was a pledge or a promise&mdash;of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to proceed with the nomination of Lake Eyre for world heritage listing. The consequences such a listing may have on the Lake Eyre and Murray-Darling basins cannot be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Murray-Darling Basin covers more than a million square kilometres&mdash;virtually all of inland south-eastern Australia&mdash;and approximately one-seventh of the continent. The river system is among the longest in the world, draining a region 1,450 kilometres long and 1,000 kilometres wide. Three-quarters of New South Wales is located in the vicinity of the basin&mdash;well over half of Victoria, 15 per cent of Queensland and seven per cent of South Australia. The basin also includes the whole of the Australian Capital Territory, Canberra being its largest centre of population. Altogether, nearly two million people live within the basin catchment and a large number of people outside the catchment region are supported by its resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual value of the basin's primary and secondary production is about $10 billion, which accounts for between 30 and 40 per cent of the total production from Australia's natural resource based industries. So the basin is of immense importance as an employer and a creator of wealth which all of us in Australia share. Half of Australia's crop land, half the sheep flock, and 25 per cent of beef and dairy cattle are within the basin region, so the basin is far more than simply a food basket. I put it to the House that it is critical for the future of Australian agriculture and for so many jobs that are created as a result of the wealth that it creates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 140 parks have been established throughout the basin to conserve areas of natural habitat and landscapes. The area is littered with culturally and historically significant sites. Adjacent to the Murray-Darling Basin lies the Lake Eyre basin catchment region, another region of the great Australian inland river systems. The Lake Eyre basin is one of the world's largest internally draining wetland systems. The area represents 16 per cent of the Australian land mass, which equates to about 1.25 million square kilometres. The federal government's proposal to nominate the basin area for world heritage listing is really quite laughable. However, let us move back to the Murray River. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Murray River in its natural state suffers severe variability of flow, as is typical of many Australian rivers. It obviously reflects the unpredictable nature of seasons and the weather patterns throughout the continent. Given this factor, the River Murray waters agreement was entered into in 1915. This agreement was largely aimed at improving river flows for navigation and irrigation purposes. In the early settlement and development of inland Australia, the Murray River system and the Darling River system were major transport routes for much of the produce of that region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Engineering solutions to problems of water management dominated the River Murray waters agreement and the subsequent River Murray Commission. In late 1987 the agreement was changed to become the Murray-Darling Basin agreement, reflecting greater community interest in the preservation and management of the basin's vital and irreplaceable resource. The Murray-Darling Basin agreement established a ministerial council consisting of up to three ministers from each government who have prime responsibility for matters relating to water, land and the environment. The aim of the agreement was to initiate a more cooperative approach to basin-wide resource and environment management than would be possible through independent action by the Commonwealth and states. The agreement recognises that state boundaries should not hinder responsible water management. The same principle applies to the Lake Eyre world heritage nomination. The ecological realities of the situation transcend state boundaries. I am sure the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) would be well aware of that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Minister for Environment and Heritage, Molly Robson, has naively stated that the push by the South Australian conservation movement to nominate parts of the Lake Eyre basin for world heritage listing does not impact on Queensland. She would know however, but conveniently has not made the point, that the Commonwealth has the power to override any opposition from the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed world heritage region in the Lake Eyre basin is larger than any listed heritage area in the world. It is larger than the world heritage regions of the Great Barrier Reef, the Tasmanian wilderness, Kakadu and the Rocky Mountains combined. The implications for submitting a management plan for an area of this size are overwhelming. This country represents some of the most remote and inaccessible regions in Australia. It is unfortunate that regulation has displaced convention in the management of our unique environment. Is world heritage classification to be the only criterion for our unique landmarks and precious resources? The Lake Eyre region is already heavily protected under the National Estate and the relevant national parks acts. Any proposal to extend preservation measures should also take into consideration the preservation of our economic opportunities. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major proportion of Australia's mineral resources&mdash;including copper, gas, gold, oil, lead and zinc&mdash;is located within the limits of the Lake Eyre catchment basin. Wool and beef are the principal commodities produced in the Queensland region of the basin. The value of production attributed to western Queensland shires located in the Lake Eyre catchment totalled a massive $241 million in 1991. That point was made very clear to us in my recent visit to the Diamantina Shire Council's headquarters at Bedourie which is on the Eyre Creek and Georgina River which ultimately flows down to Lake Eyre. That $241 million represents a massive 62 per cent of the region's entire output. A large proportion of the remaining output is attributed to sectors servicing grazing districts.

I would like to know&mdash;as I am sure the people of that region would like to know&mdash;what the minister really has in mind. Perhaps at the moment she is a little too busy reshuffling her 3,000-odd staff in Canberra, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> only last week, to think of those people in that remote part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do want to refer back to the Murray-Darling. Last year, Queensland consented to join the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement. Many of the problems affecting our land and water resource are interrelated and cannot be effectively solved individually. There is widespread concern at the spread of land degradation, deteriorating water quality, rising ground water salinity and loss of native flora and fauna. In 1987, it was estimated that the losses to agriculture alone amounted to something like $260 million&mdash;and of course that figure pales into insignificance today because we have not really solved the problem yet&mdash;and costs due to river salinity amounted to $35 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent outbreaks of algal blooms are further testimony of the need for a coordinated approach to water management. Strict limits on the amount of phosphorus contained in detergents should be agreed to by all states in order to combat outbreaks of blue-green algae. The Queensland water quality task force recently handed down a report recommending that an upper limit of five per cent phosphorus in detergents be mandatory within 18 to 24 months. Similar reports undertaken by a New South Wales task force identified that phosphorus from household detergents passing into river systems through sewage treatment plants was a major source of nutrients for the blue-green algae. Up to half the phosphorus leaving sewage treatment plants comes from washing powders. The Queensland government must now follow the New South Wales lead by approving a five per cent limit by weight for phosphorus in detergents and laundry powders as that task force has found it is a major contaminant in our inland river systems. We cannot afford to have the blue-green algae problem ignored by state governments. Water management is their responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The blue-green algae was rampant through America and Canada in the 1960s when it was rumoured that Lake Erie was dead. Through an amendment to the Canadian water act, the amount of phosphorus in laundry detergents was limited to two per cent by weight. Prior to this amendment, the amount of phosphorus in laundry detergents was as much as 50 per cent by weight. Twenty years later, the algal blooms of Lake Erie are now at manageable and acceptable levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existence of blue-green algae is a clear warning that Australian river systems are in trouble. This is a concern for all Australians and it should be tackled by a national agreement. Agricultural sources and urban run-off are also factors attributable to the blue-green algae epidemic. The problem in Queensland is not as severe as in the south-east of the continent, particularly in New South Wales. In fact, the Queensland section of the basin is quite different from those of the more southern states. The Queensland section of the basin covers 15 per cent of the state. It has major urban centres in its area: Toowoomba, Warwick, Dalby and Goondiwindi&mdash;just to name a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industries serviced in the basin in Queensland include wool, beef, cotton, grain, horticultural and food processing. The Queensland rivers are rainfall run-off carriers and have no permanent flow base, unlike what we find in the Murray and Murrumbidgee where a lot of the run-off is sourced in the Kosciusko National Park and comes originally from the snowfalls. The Queensland rivers do not drain substantial ground water aquifers and, thankfully, have no salinity problems of any magnitude, unlike the situation in southern states. In the Queensland flood plain areas, the rivers simply represent a low flow channel which carries a small percentage of flood flows. On average, it is estimated that Queensland contributes only four per cent of the flow of the Murray River. Almost 90 per cent of the flow out of Queensland is lost on the flood plain and does not reach the Menindee Lake where the Murray-Darling regulations begin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well recognised that the pastoral lands of western Queensland and New South Wales rely heavily on these flood flows to regenerate native pastures and timber in that area. The flows are therefore not entirely lost. Queensland is subject to an entirely different set of environmental conditions. The primary source of surface water for the basin is rainfall run-off occurring predominantly in the form of summer storms and the monsoonal wet season. The annual rainfall is highly variable and of course can vary from light falls to heavy tropical downpours. The tropical downpours are characteristic of Queensland weather patterns, while rainfalls in the southern states are much more moderate and Mediterranean in nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that a lot of water originates from melting snow in the southern section of the Murray-Darling Basin further highlights the differences between Queensland weather patterns and those of the southern states. Such weather patterns result in different problems and therefore the need for different solutions. Queensland weather patterns call for greater storage needs, thus the prevalence of dams across the Darling Downs. Sections of the Queensland basin have evolved from treeless plains while certain sections of the New South Wales basin have evolved from eucalypt forests. So, while salinity may be a greater problem in New South Wales, Queensland has its share of erosion and soil management crises. Of course, a lot of it is caused by heavy rainfall patterns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These differing concerns must not be overlooked with Queensland joining the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland has also expressed concern that decisions made by the council, prior to Queensland joining, will have been made without full discussion from that perspective. Any decisions, therefore, should be clearly stated in the schedule to the agreement. Further conditions to agreements have included the retention of the Queensland border rivers agreement. This agreement has been in place between Queensland and New South Wales since 1946 and provides the water sharing negotiations across the border for the streams of the Murray-Darling Basin. Quite obviously, actions in Queensland do affect other parts of the basin. Although the Queensland section of the basin may not impact heavily on the rest of the basin, it is believed that the state borders should not be a major impediment to the cooperative nature of the resource management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, as a result of Queensland joining the agreement, a greater level of cooperation and understanding between all regions can be accomplished, the initiative will have been most worthwhile. Whilst this advantage is generally recognised by all communities of interest, concerns have been raised regarding the need to acknowledge the inherent difference between the Queensland region and the more southern regions of the basin. These concerns and differences must not be lost to a national agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, water management is of increasing and vital importance to the entire nation. National strategies must be adhered to while regional considerations must not be overlooked. We need a national agreement on the level of phosphates permeating our water systems, and we also need a more individual approach to the problems of salinity in New South Wales and erosion in Queensland. Resource and environmental degradation of the Murray-Darling Basin should be of concern to all Australians. The basin is Australia's most important agricultural resource. If water is the food of all life, the Murray-Darling basin is the lifeblood of Australia. </PARA>

One may wonder why a person from a city electorate such as Dunkley, which takes in great areas such as Frankston and Chelsea, would speak on the Murray-Darling Basin. It has a great effect on us, especially on those of us who are environmentally aware and concerned. We do not have any large rivers on the Mornington Peninsula except one&mdash;which is called the Mornington Peninsula river. It flows from the Carrum sewage treatment plant down to Cape Schanck. Millions of litres of water are wasted every day from Melbourne's sewerage system; it just flows out into Bass Strait. That is a huge river of water just going to waste. This is something which has not been tapped. I am quite certain the lessons that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission learns will some day be able to be put to good use for all this water which is going to waste at the moment down at Cape Schanck. I can assure honourable members that even though the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works says that it is treated effectively, it is not. My sons and daughter go surfing down that way, and they can tell many stories about what are commonly called `floaters' in the water. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) in his second reading speech said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Murray-Darling Basin comprises about one-seventh of Australia. It also produces about one-half of Australia's total output from natural resource based industries. It supports 25 per cent of the nation's cattle and dairy farms, about 50 per cent of its sheep, lambs and crop land, and almost 75 per cent of its irrigated land. Production derived is valued at some $10 billion annually. It is Australia's agricultural heartland.</PARA>
<PARA>The Murray-Darling is not only Australia's agricultural heartland; it is also regarded, regrettably, as Australia's biggest sewage treatment plant. The Murray-Darling Basin supports about 60 million sheep and about six million cattle. On top of these free range animals, there are over 250 cattle feedlots with approximately 300,000 head of cattle and also about 1.1 million pigs. They produce as much nitrogen as four million people and as much phosphorus as five million people. This is roughly as much as is contained in the sewage of Melbourne and Sydney combined. There are over 200 towns with a total population, I thought, of one million people, but the previous speaker, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), said two million. I do not know how many there are, but there is an awful lot of people in there. Most of this sewage waste also goes into the Murray-Darling system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that the Darling River holds the world record for the largest toxic algal bloom recorded&mdash;1,000 kilometres of the Barwon and Darling rivers? Honourable members have all seen photographs of it on the TV. It shocked the whole of Australia, and it particularly shocked people living in that area. It had been predicted but, like most warnings given by scientists, the warning was ignored. However, in 1991 the combination of drought, high summer temperatures, low river flows&mdash;also depleted by pumping for irrigation&mdash;and, of course, nutrients from agriculture and townships created ideal conditions for this outbreak. People who normally took drinking water from the river had to stop and rely on rainwater tanks. The army was called in to supply water to the area. South Australia was particularly worried because 90 per cent of that state's population relies on this water&mdash;the same sewage contaminated water. Some of the toxins in it are deadly. A laboratory mouse injected with a solution of peptide heptatoxin will be dead between 30 minutes to 24 hours later. One solution to this problem would be to make certain that some sort of program was set in place to stop this effluent from getting into the rivers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A division of forestry research team headed by Mr Brian Myers examined the use of treated sewage effluent for irrigating trees. Outside Wagga Wagga, in New South Wales, they are supplying a 7.5-hectare pine and eucalyptus plantation with water and organic wastes from sewage treatment works. Every day 4,500 billion litres of sewage effluent are pumped into Australia's rivers and oceans. This is a major source of nitrogen and phosphorus, and could be used to grow trees. Dr Myers estimates that effluent resource, as he calls it, in the Murray-Darling Basin is sufficient to support 18,000 hectares of tree plantations which are capable of supplying 360,000 tonnes of wood per year from land that would otherwise produce little useable timber. This is the sort of thing that could be done with the actual waste, which at the moment is flowing into our rivers in the Murray-Darling Basin&mdash;and some people in South Australia are drinking it. I am glad that I do not live there. </PARA>
<PARA>The direct costs of the Darling River bloom in 1991 were estimated to be at least $1.3 million. In South Australia the blooms during 1991-92 incurred a direct cost of around $400,000, and in Queensland about $200,000. This does not take into account recreation and tourism, which is also adversely affected. Losses of income for local shops and hotels were also not taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA>Water is a renewable resource. However, our land based water is dying because of how we treat it. We have dammed it, we have drained it, we have given it exotic plants and animals, and we have polluted it with everything imaginable. We can still repair our waterways and bring them back to life. This invaluable resource of water must be protected. People who use water must be educated in its use. They must pay the true price for water, especially irrigators. This will certainly make them use water wisely&mdash;and certainly upset them. </PARA>
<PARA>Some time ago the Central Darling shire persuaded the Department of Water Resources to release a small head of water from upstream irrigation dams above Bourke to flush the Darling from Bourke to Menindee. The head reached Tilpa&mdash;a hundred kilometres up river from Wilcannia. However, cotton farmers around Bourke were given permission to start pumping. They created such a hole in the river that the Darling actually flowed backwards, and the flush never even reached Wilcannia. This, of course, created some concern amongst those who had pushed hard for the flushing. </PARA>

Water creates other minor conflicts between neighbours. Water running off one property onto another property can create real problems.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Shepparton area two farmers went to court to decide whether a levee bank built on one property could be allowed to stay because it stopped the natural flow of a watercourse. At one stage, both farmers had levee banks and water was being pumped onto the roadway between the properties. A very expensive and bitter court case followed which set a precedent regarding banks and drainage by ruling that the banks had to be pulled down. However, I believe the Victorian government has not yet acted to make certain that all these levee banks come down and many still remain. There is still much concern and conflict in the irrigation areas around Shepparton. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time I have left I would like to raise an old idea but one which I think, with new technology and a better understanding of the interaction of water and our environment, may have some merit. It would certainly create a lot of jobs. I am talking about the Bradfield scheme. From time immemorial, people have dreamed of turning deserts into gardens. In Australia, the driest of the continents with its vast inland and arid areas, the thoughts of many people over the years have turned to diverting the northern coastal rivers of Queensland to irrigate large tracts of country in western Queensland and particularly the Lake Eyre basin. </PARA>

It was the largest water resource project since I think the Ord River was built. It was an environmentally friendly dam and studies by AIMS made certain of this. I must say that construction of the Burdekin Dam was promised by all governments, but only one government delivered it: the Labor government. A lot of thanks must go to the parliamentary secretary for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably one of the greatest engineering challenges since European settlement of Australia would be to provide water for human enterprise in the vast inland areas of our continent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this matter was first brought to my attention it fascinated me greatly, particularly when I found out that it was first discussed in 1887 by E.A. Leonard of the Queensland branch of the Royal Geographical Society. I then started to investigate. I unearthed a vast amount of information&mdash;much of it highly technical. Some of the main points are that the arid interior of Australia and the vast river system that drains towards Lake Eyre have always proved a challenge to the many dreamers over the years who wanted to make these dry lands bloom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their ideas have fallen largely into two categories. The first was the filling of the dry bed of Lake Eyre in the hope that evaporation from the water surface would cool and increase rainfall in the area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second idea involved the diversion of Queensland coastal rivers to feed the water courses of the inland system. Probably the most famous to promote such a scheme was, as I said, Dr Bradfield who made the first concrete proposal in 1938. Bradfield was a noted engineer who should also be remembered as a co-designer of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Turning deserts into gardens was a passion he held until his death in the early 1940s.

<PARA>However, Bradfield was not the only one to advocate such a scheme. About the same time, in the late 1930s, author and traveller, Ion Idriess, also advocated a scheme for the irrigation of vast areas of central Australia. Broadly speaking, the object of the Bradfield and Idriess plans was to divert water from the rivers of Queensland for the irrigation of vast tracts in the Lake Eyre basin. </PARA>

The east coast rivers drain a slightly larger catchment area of 285,000 square kilometres, which has a yield of about 130,000,000 megalitres of water.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The greatest issue facing our nation is how to provide jobs for our fellow Australians. Too many are now out of work. Too many have been out of work for too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary objective of this budget is jobs: jobs in the short term by providing a further fiscal stimulus to the economy this year&mdash;to sustain Australia's economic growth until the motor of world recovery kicks in. And jobs in the medium and longer term by boosting the capacity of Australian businesses to expand production on a world-competitive basis. This is a budget to strengthen the recovery and make it sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has had a number of economic recoveries in the post-war period, only to see them taper off prematurely. But this recovery is different. It is different, because firmly embedded into Australia's economic structure we now have two vital ingredients: inflation at levels lower than seen for 30 years; interest rates at their lowest in 20 years. These have been the twin goals of every government for a quarter of a century. But it is this government which has attained them, and harnessed them for the future benefit of all Australians. And that makes this recovery different. This is a quality recovery&mdash;a durable recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, this budget establishes an economic framework over four years: a framework for continuing low interest rates and continuing low inflation, which, combined with reduced company tax and generous investment incentives, will support increased business investment for future growth in production and employment. This budget sets us on a prudent path, leading to lower government deficits and higher national saving. This budget proposes measures which, overall, will cut the deficit four years from now by $9 billion. These steps will see the public sector directly contribute some $17 billion to the improvement of national saving over the three years to 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget also takes action on government programs put forward in the context of the last election. Well over 100 separate spending commitments will be implemented. These will be fully funded over the course of the next four years. These commitments give effect to the government's plans to provide extra help to families with children, extra assistance to those out of work, improved health services, and other initiatives to make this society even fairer, even more cohesive. Other commitments include action to enrich the culture of our country, protect its environment, and support those living outside the major cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget will also provide new support for our emerging exporters, who are demonstrating such remarkable success in capturing new markets for products made and developed by the skilled hands and creative minds of Australia's working men and women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget also provides relief for middle Australia by lowering marginal tax rates for those on incomes between $20,700 and $50,000. This will reduce the tax paid by a person on $600 per week by $8 per week. Not only will this promised tax cut be delivered, it will be delivered eight months early, commencing on 1 November 1993:  just eleven weeks away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This early payment is largely made possible by higher dividends from businesses like Telecom, and from the Reserve Bank. It is only right that taxpayers should benefit from the higher earnings of these publicly-owned bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has decided to go further with the tax cuts by extending the benefits to low-income taxpayers. Those on incomes below $23,200 will receive a new rebate paid on assessment. This will relieve about 90,000 taxpayers of their entire tax bill, and ensure that a tax cut of $100 or more is paid to all other taxpayers annually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combined effects of the budget measures will result in a deficit of $16 billion this year. This will provide an extra stimulus of around $2 billion to Australia's economy at a time when a stimulus is needed to sustain the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>THE ECONOMIC CONTEXT</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's subdued recovery in part reflects the time taken to recover from the sapping effects of the debt build-up and falling asset prices of the late 1980s. Of more importance, though, is the continuing weakness of the world economy. Whereas a year ago growth in the industrialised economies was expected to be three per cent in 1993, it is now expected to be a little over one per cent. Japan and Germany, the world's second and third largest economies, have yet to emerge from recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, Australia has done well and will continue to do so. Our GDP growth in 1992-93 was 2 1/2 per cent&mdash;a rate the envy of the industrialised world. Our relatively good performance can be attributed to two factors. First, the Government's foresight in building up budget surpluses in the late 1980s, and then using that capacity to provide a major fiscal stimulus to the economy when it was required. And second, our growing trade and investment links with the fastest growing region of the world&mdash;the dynamic economies of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, the short-term outlook for the world economy remains subdued and therefore places a constraint on our own growth. The world outlook, however, is expected to improve during 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's challenge is to position itself to take full advantage of stronger world growth as it comes on stream and to continue our integration with the Asian economies. Above all, this will require the further development of world-class industries able to seek out and exploit new opportunities. That assures the best long-term prospect of reducing unemployment and raising Australian living standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Policy will have its part to play: by building on the substantial structural reform achieved over the past 10 years; by maintaining the much improved competitive position of our export industries&mdash;especially through low inflation; and by adjusting fiscal policy so that sufficient domestic saving is available to fund the additional investment required. </PARA>
<PARA>BUDGET STRATEGY</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, at the July Premiers Conference, all Australian governments agreed on the key challenge for fiscal policy today. The conference benefited from a major report on national saving commissioned from Dr Vince FitzGerald, a response to which I am releasing tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fiscal challenge is to continue the stimulus of activity over the next year to encourage economic recovery and job growth, while setting in train medium-term adjustments to significantly increase public sector spending. From next financial year, the process of withdrawing the stimulus and cutting the deficit will begin. Whilst the growth path of the economy will assist, on its own it will be insufficient to accomplish the task. This budget therefore contains measures which will accelerate the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four years from now, the deficit will be cut to less than $6 billion, or around one per cent of GDP. This meets a key election commitment of the government. It will be achieved through five complementary steps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the second round of tax cuts will be deferred from 1996 until a time when fiscal conditions permit, probably in 1998. Second, outlays will be reduced by $2 billion. Third, the income tax system will be tightened to remove or reduce certain concessions, and to tax non-cash benefits in a manner more equivalent to the taxation of the ordinary income of wage and salary earners. This will raise $600 million. Fourth, rates of excise on petroleum products and tobacco will be progressively increased. Fifth, wholesale sales tax rates will be increased in two stages over the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of these outlays and revenue measures will reduce the prospective deficit for 1996-97 by $9 billion. But these changes will do more than that. They will halt the erosion of Commonwealth indirect tax revenues&mdash;thus preventing Australia's tax system becoming lopsided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The share of tax revenue, other than from income tax, has fallen by almost a third&mdash;from 8.3 per cent of GDP in the mid-1980s to 5.9 per cent last year. Failure to act on the indirect tax side would create pressures for more weight on income tax, a weight which would fall more heavily on middle income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will meet its announced objectives, without the introduction of a massive new indirect tax. The government will maintain indirect tax exemptions for the necessities of life. The government will maintain the system of higher tax rates for luxury items&mdash;such as fur coats, jewellery and expensive cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compared with the taxation situation applying last financial year, the benefits flowing from the income tax cuts plus the new rebate amount to $1.7 billion this financial year, rising to $3.8 billion. The indirect tax increases raise $1.3 billion this financial year, rising to $3.0 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, in each year the benefits from the tax cuts will greatly exceed the extra indirect tax revenue&mdash;with these benefits being delivered to middle Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>MEASURES</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the main aspects of the measures, full details of which are provided in supporting documents. Excise on petroleum products will rise by 3c a litre from tonight and a further 2c a litre a year later. An additional increase on leaded petrol will commence in February next year at 1c per litre rising to 5c per litre a year later. This recognises the harmful effect of lead in petrol, particularly on the children of Australia, and will accelerate the conversion of the motor vehicle fleet to unleaded petrol. Even if all these increases in fuel excises were implemented overnight, Australia would still have the third lowest petrol prices in the industrialised world&mdash;and amongst the lowest fuel taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Excise on tobacco products will rise three per cent tonight and in four similar steps over two years. Excise on beer and spirits will remain unchanged. From tonight, the existing wholesale sales tax rates will increase by one per cent, and by a further one per cent in 1995. Wine is currently more lightly taxed than beer and spirits. From tonight, tax on wine will apply at the 31 per cent rate. But the government is committed to retaining the exclusion of wine from excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From tomorrow, lump sum payments of unused annual leave and long service leave will be taxed as normal income. But concessions will remain for those now aged 55 years or more, and those who leave their jobs through redundancy or for invalidity reasons. From April 1994, salary package benefits, such as membership of social clubs and similar items, will be fully subject to the fringe benefits tax arrangements, together with domestic travel expenses and accommodation costs in excess of reasonable levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the entire net revenue increase over the next four years from the budget tax measures: not $1 will go towards increased expenditure; not $1 will go towards meeting the government's spending commitments made at the time of the election. These spending commitments have been funded over the four years by reducing outlays in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the key spending and savings measures. In the health area, savings will be achieved by reducing double dipping on Medicare benefits; reducing Medicare fraud and overservicing through new cooperative arrangements; and enhanced auditing of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The safety net for the PBS will be tightened for non-card holders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further savings will come from restricting access to Medicare benefits for optometry services. This will place optometry on a basis comparable to the new dental health program. The growth of defence spending will be reduced. The pension age for women will be increased to 65 in line with the pension age for men. But this will be gradually introduced over 20 years&mdash;minimising the impact on those approaching retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is concerned that some families of fairly comfortable means have been able to exploit negative gearing to meet income test rules. From 1 January 1995, the income tests for a range of programs including Austudy and family payments will be changed, so that net losses from negative gearing of rental properties are added back to other income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondary Austudy for students living at home will start in future at the age of 17. However, the additional family payment system will be extended. This will result in tighter targeting, and improved benefits to those families eligible for rent assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New arrangements for the higher education contribution scheme will mean students commence repayments earlier and at higher rates, but with the income-contingent feature of the repayments preserved. The income test ceiling for the basic family payment will be lowered to $60,000, removing the benefit from the highest income six per cent of families currently receiving the payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, this budget takes as a key objective the implementation of the government's election commitments. Over 100 of these commitments will have been met since the election and in this budget. Full details are set out in a special report included with the budget documents. The implementation of the remaining few is still being resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with some of the major commitments briefly. The new Commonwealth dental health program will provide all health card holders with improved access to emergency care from next January&mdash;and basic dental care from six months later. The new child-care cash rebate of 30 per cent of claimable costs will be introduced from July next year, to be paid to eligible families regardless of income. A total of 230,000 Australian families will benefit from this measure, with payments of up to $28.20 per week for one child, and $61.20 for two or more children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new home child-care allowance will be paid from September next year. It will provide payments of up to $30 per week and will replace the dependent spouse rebate for couples with children. A total of 840,000 Australian families will benefit. This is a substantial and progressive change to Australia's income support system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new seniors health card will be provided, from 1 July next year, to low income retirees not currently receiving the pension. This will entitle some 200,000 older Australians to benefits which include concessional pharmaceuticals and hearing aids, and access to the new dental health program. The pension assets test will be eased with effect from September this year and will benefit around 60,000 non-pensioner and part-pensioner retirees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, this budget also contains a number of initiatives additional to those raised in the election context. The government said in the election that it would not forget the unemployed, nor leave them behind. To address this problem more fully, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has established a committee on employment opportunities, comprising recognised experts in this area. The committee is examining current policies on unemployment, and possible alternatives, and will prepare a discussion paper by December this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will form the basis for broad community debate, leading to a government white paper on the issue. This will provide the forum for consideration of any new approaches for dealing with this very real social and economic problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But for now this budget will provide increased support for Australia's unemployed in two substantial ways. First, the total number of labour market program places available this financial year will be increased to over 500,000. Two-thirds of these are for people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. Second, we will increase by $6 per fortnight the rate of newstart allowance paid to single adults without children, unemployed for more than 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA>INVESTMENT AND TRADE</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One sure way to reduce unemployment is through the expansion and development of Australian industry. That requires business investment and to secure that business investment, Australian governments need to create the most favourable environment for the expansion of productive business and jobs. Creating that environment requires the establishment of a stable framework for business planning. Crucial to that, there must be confidence that Australia's prospective budget deficit is being reduced substantially over the medium term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, this Government is actively promoting Australia's economic transition through its taxation policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Action has already been taken to implement a number of election commitments in this area. Central to these was the reduction in the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, effective from last July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have given investment an additional fillip by introducing a general investment allowance and have expanded the development allowance. This budget goes further by providing a boost to exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere is Australia's economic transition more evident than in our trading performance. Exports account for 20 per cent of total goods and services we produce, compared with 13 per cent a decade ago. The composition of our trade has changed and matured. Exports of the more sophisticated manufactured goods have grown at 20 per cent annually over the last seven years. The destination of Australia's exports has also shifted dramatically, with Asia now taking almost 60 per cent of our merchandise exports. This partly reflects the much higher growth rates in Asia than in the older industrialised world. It also reflects our developing trade success in the region. We must build on the progress to date and encourage greater engagement with the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One initiative I am announcing tonight is the establishment of a committee jointly with the Northern Territory government to consider strategies to develop the potential of Darwin as Australia's northern link to east Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">McKinsey's recent study of emerging exporters revealed that much of the impetus for our recent export growth has come from 700 small to medium-sized manufacturing exporters. These exporters earned over $8 billion in 1990-91, double the level of four years earlier. According to that study, 90 per cent of Australia's manufacturers&mdash;more than 6,000 businesses&mdash;are not yet exporting, but most could, suggesting an undeveloped source of potential exports and employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge is to see many more of these companies achieve their potential. Accordingly, $94 million will be provided over the next three years to fund a package of measures designed to encourage more small to medium-sized firms to commence exporting and to intensify the efforts of those existing exporters. These measures include the establishment of first stop shops, improvements to the export market development grants scheme, and the establishment of a `Market Australia' campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further details of the government's strategies to improve Australia's trade performance can be found in a separate paper, released tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>OTHER POLICY SETTINGS</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, other policy settings are also crucial to boosting Australia's competitive position. Wages policy is making its contribution, by supporting a more decentralised and flexible system to secure faster productivity growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workplace bargaining is becoming the centrepiece of the system, with now over 1,000 federally registered enterprise agreements. Work practices can now be better attuned to the needs of individual firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such changes could not have been achieved without the support and commitment of Australia's trade union movement. The government's accord with the ACTU will maintain the framework for reform, and increase the focus on workplace bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will protect vulnerable workers with legislation to guarantee minimum wages and conditions. We will also support an arbitrated safety net adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, continued and accelerated structural reform is critical to increasing growth in the economy and expanding job opportunities. We have carried out extensive reforms in the past decade. Some of the payoffs are already evident and include lower domestic air fares, lower phone charges, greater labour productivity in shipping and on our railways, and better ship cargo handling rates and turnaround times. Such reforms improve Australia's prospects in an increasingly competitive world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process will be taken further when the government considers the report of the national competition policy review, which we expect to receive in the next few days. </PARA>
<PARA>ECONOMIC PROSPECTS/CONCLUSIONS</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, the budget I present tonight marks the commencement of a new era in Australian public finance. It is the first Commonwealth budget crafted within the framework of a national fiscal strategy&mdash;with its figuring informed by July's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Fiscal Outlook</EMPHASIS> report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be the last Commonwealth budget brought down in August. From next year, the budget will be delivered before the end of June. That will allow decision makers to plan for a full financial year, fully informed of the details of Commonwealth  policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight's budget is designed to fortify the framework of Australia's economic growth. In the short term, it provides a continuing stimulus while the economy is still being buffeted by weak international growth. Despite these headwinds, growth is expected to be a little stronger in the year ahead, and at a rate few other industrialised countries will exceed. Growth this year will be aided by continuing steady growth in private consumption, stronger public sector demand and a contribution from net exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business investment is expected to improve. This augurs well for the future. It will help the recovery to gain momentum. Employment growth will begin to recover, but not fast enough to make major inroads into unemployment this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Mr Speaker, this budget is not just about this year. It is part of a longer term strategy: a strategy to build the savings of the nation as the economy recovers, so that private investment can be financed, and more of it financed at home; a strategy that builds on and complements the impressive progress already made in improving our economic strengths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next four years the economic transition we embarked upon 10 years ago will be taken further: the transition from being inward looking and highly protected to a modern world class economy; the transition from excessive reliance on our ties with Europe to participating in the opportunities provided by the economic dynamism of the Asia-Pacific region; no longer is Australia a European outpost on the far side of the world; we have seen the tyranny of distance give way to the blessing of proximity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have redirected our trade focus and diversified our export base. We are 30 per cent more competitive than we were 10 years ago. Productivity has grown by five per cent over the past two years. The profit share has recovered to the high levels of the late 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But beyond all else, the two most historically important achievements are those on inflation and interest rates. It is 30 years since inflation has been so low, and monetary policy will play its part in keeping core inflation low. It is 20 years since interest rates have been so low. These are achievements to be proud of. They are the vital building blocks for better investment and export performance. They result from a coordinated and coherent strategy of reform across all sectors of the economy. In the 1980s, Australia led the developed world in structural reform, and we are staying the course in the 1990s so as to maximise the benefits of the reforms to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, this budget details a coherent and carefully designed plan for achieving the government's announced fiscal objective of reducing the deficit over four years. It continues the government's strong record of fiscal responsibility established in the 1980s whilst delivering on our election commitments and it does so by keeping Australia a low tax country and at the same time delivering substantial income tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next month, Australia will be confirmed by the OECD as the country with the lowest level of taxation in the industrialised world. The decisions announced tonight are designed to keep Australia in the low tax league. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, tonight's budget reinforces the strengths on which Australia's long-term prosperity depends. It provides a prudent path to the future: a path leading to an Australia which saves more; a path leading to an Australia which can invest more in its own undoubted strengths; a path leading crucially to more jobs for our people. I commend the budget to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>This Loan Bill 1993 is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the loan fund rather than the consolidated revenue fund and to supplement the moneys available to the consolidated revenue fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legally, expenditure from the consolidated revenue fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that fund. Successive governments have adopted the practice of introducing a loan bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the loan fund to meet expenditure that has been appropriated by the parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the consolidated revenue fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund. The budget deficit of $16 billion for 1993-94 gives rise to a prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund about $7 billion higher. This situation arises because appropriations from that fund include various items which are functionally classified as financing transactions rather than outlays, and thus do not affect the budget outcome. These items include payments to the national debt sinking fund to redeem or repurchase Commonwealth securities and superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides authority for the loan fund to meet defence expenditures incurred after the passage of the bill that would otherwise have been met from the consolidated revenue fund, and to supplement the consolidated revenue fund so that it can meet its other commitments.

<PARA>Earlier this evening the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) announced as part of the 1993-94 budget a number of changes to the tax system. The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 will amend the tax laws to give effect to the most important of those changes. I propose to outline briefly the measures contained in this bill. More detailed explanations of the measures are contained in statement 4 of Budget Paper No. 1 and in the explanatory memorandum being circulated to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in the bill will change the timing for the commencement of the two stage reduction in the tax rates announced in One Nation on 26 February 1992. The first stage will now commence on 1 November 1993, eight months earlier than scheduled. The bill provides that the second stage of tax cuts will commence at the beginning of a financial year to be fixed by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the first stage of the tax cuts will commence on 1 November 1993, the bill contains the new composite rate scales to apply for 1993-94 and the first stage rates for the 1994-95 and later income years. The new rates to apply from 1 November 1993 will benefit taxpayers with taxable incomes in excess of $20,700. The tax cuts will cost the revenue $1.66 billion this financial year. The ongoing cost to revenue of the first stage of the personal tax cuts is $2.9 billion in 1994-95 and $3.12 billion in 1995-96. </PARA>

The rebate will reduce at the rate of 4c in each dollar of taxable income in excess of $20,700 and completely phase out when taxable income reaches $23,200. The estimated revenue costs for this measure are $340 million in 1994-95, $330 million in 1995-96 and $320 million in 1996-97. </PARA>

For 1993-94, individuals with taxable incomes of up to $12,688 and couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $21,366 will not be required to pay the levy. There will be no change to the provisions which increase the threshold for couples and sole parents by $2,100 for each dependent child or student.

Some low-alcohol wine is currently taxable at 20 per cent and its rate of tax will increase to 21 per cent in line with the proposed increase for all sales tax rates.

<PARA>This bill proposes amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 to increase the customs duty payable on manufactured tobacco, tobacco products and certain petroleum products as part of the package of deficit reduction measures announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in his budget speech earlier this evening. These amendments are complementary to those for the Excise Tariff Act 1921 contained in the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill which has just been read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed increases occur in the same stages and are the same amounts as the increases in excise duty. The duty increases will be cumulative. The new rate of duty on each occasion commencing in February 1994 will be determined by adding to the previous duty rate any increase stemming from indexation based on movements in the consumer price index and the additional amount specified for the period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) As part of its overall decentralisation strategy, the ATO is establishing a Branch Office with potential staffing level of approximately 260 staff in Geelong. As part of this process a number of accommodation options were considered, including utilising existing office space in the area. This process resulted in the ATO negotiating a ten year lease on the building at 92-100 Brougham Street, Geelong,  This building comprises 5,740 square metres of office accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end of a lift-lobby (approximately 28 square metres) on the fifth floor has been converted to usable office space by removing some stonework and installing carpet. The room has been allocated initially for union use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) An area approximately 28 square metres of black granite was removed from the fifth floor lift lobby and the area carpeted at a cost of $1,344 which was met by the ATO as part of its fitout. The granite, which had been laid on a mortar-bed, was removed  by hand in order to minimise damage and maximise re-use of salvaged material. Some of that salvaged material was used for patching stonework on the ground floor of the building after the installation of sliding doors. The balance is being held in store for use, as and when required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. The provision of facilities, including office space, for union use is an ongoing arrangement in line with APS policy on industrial democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Yes. One of the specific elements of the agreement is the provision for use by the PSU of "a room with a desk, a lockable cabinet and an unbarred telephone" in each Branch Office. This standard requires a union room to be provided at the same size as a normal office. The room currently used as a union room in Geelong is larger than a normal office because of the use of the end of a lift lobby which otherwise would have been unusable.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Government business enterprise, Telecom is responsible for making its own commercial and management decisions within the context of legislative requirements and Government policies. In particular, Telecom has responsibility for setting charges for services. While Part 6 of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Act 1991 provides that the Minister may determine general price control arrangements for Telecom, subsection 9(2) of the Act provides that the Minister "must not give a direction . . . in relation to the amounts to be charged for work done, or services, goods or information supplied, by AOTC."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom has advised that it has investigated the practice of certain overseas countries of providing "free" local calls. This normally involves the payment of a monthly fee to cover an amount of network usage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom advises that it does not consider such a scheme to be a practical option, since it would disadvantage about 40 per cent of Telecom's customers who have a small daily calling rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom further informs me that, if not recovered through a direct usage charge, the cost of providing local calls would need to be recovered through some other means. Typically, in those administrations where local calls are provided "free", the cost is recovered through higher access charges (that is, rental charges) or is subsidised by long distance charges.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) The capital gains tax (CGT) provisions of the taxation law are intended to operate in a broad range of situations. They generally apply where an asset is acquired and disposed of after 19 September 1985, and where certain capital payments are received after that date. The Government is not aware of any circumstances where the CGT provisions operate in an unexpected manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The CGT provisions do not usually apply on the death of a person&mdash;liability to tax is generally rolled-over to successors and is assessed on a subsequent disposal of the asset by the successor. There are two exceptions to this general rule. The first is where an asset passes to a beneficiary whose income is exempt from tax or is concessionally taxed. The second is where a non-taxable Australian asset passes to a non-resident beneficiary. In both of these situations, the deceased is taken to have disposed of the asset to the beneficiary immediately before his or her death. This ensures that any capital gain which accrued while the deceased owned the asset is appropriately taxed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxing of the assets of a deceased in these situations is limited to any gain which accrued in respect of those assets that were acquired by the deceased after 19 September 1985.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) As the Honourable Member will appreciate from the answer which was provided to his identical question on notice on 4 November 1992, the issues raised by the High Court's decision in the Mabo case are complex. The implications of the case, including the effect of relevant Commonwealth and State land rights legislation on native title, are being carefully considered in the context of the Commonwealth's consultation process announced by the Prime Minister in October. The Prime Minister has already publicly foreshadowed the possibility of legislation as part of the Commonwealth's response. In addition, the Government is considering this week the release of a discussion paper which seeks the views of the wider Australian community on the various options for responding to the issues raised by the Mabo judgement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) In the Mabo case the High Court held that grants of freehold title would extinguish native title. It is still uncertain whether the Court's reasoning would extend to inalienable freehold title granted under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. This matter is currently the subject of litigation in the Federal Court in the case of Pareroultja and Others v Tickner and Others. It is clear, however, that the making of grants under the Act offers immediate significant benefits to claimants by ensuring security of tenure, giving them the opportunity to protect sacred sites, to follow a traditional lifestyle if they wish and to control economic activity on the land. It should also be noted that a recommendation by an Aboriginal Land Commissioner that an area of Crown land be granted to a Land Trust is on the basis that the grant be for the benefit of Aboriginal people entitled by Aboriginal tradition to the use or occupation of that area of land, whether or not the traditional entitlement is qualified as to place, time, circumstance, purpose or permission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) It follows from my answers to parts 1 and 2 above that the question whether and to what extent it is necessary or desirable for me to "protect" native titles is a matter which is presently both the subject of Federal Court proceedings and the Government's process of consultation, and which accordingly will be determined in the context of these two developments.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two groups of members eligible to receive double benefits because of the drafting error: DFRDB members who had retired with a pension; and DFRDB members who had separated from the Defence Force and transferred their DFRDB benefits to another superannuation scheme, for instance, the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme. Where a member of either group reentered the Defence Force and then transferred to MSBS, the DFRDB benefit from the first period of service was retained by the member and an MSBS benefit would become payable for the second period of service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these intended benefits, the drafting error resulted in an unintended benefit. The drafting error allows all contributions paid during the first period of service, together with notional interest on those contributions, to be paid to the member on retirement. This means that the member not only retains the benefit from the first period of service for which the contributions were paid, but also has the contributions and interest paid as an addition to the MSBS benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Acts Interpretation Act prevented another amendment to the Rules to achieve the same end being made before 9 March 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) To date, 44 members have exited under the original rule with a total liability of some $4.8 million. None of the benefits have been paid pending a legislation solution to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) Yes. When the original instrument was disallowed by the Senate, no objection was raised to the removal of the double benefit except for the fact that the MSBS Board of Trustees had not been consulted. The Board has since agreed to steps being taken to remove the double benefit. A further instrument correcting the drafting error was signed by Minister Ray on 19 April 1993 and took effect on 22 April 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any affected member who exited before 27 May 1992 or who exited after 9 September 1992 and before 22 April will be legally entitled to the double benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the Acts Interpretation Act prevents the amending Instrument operating retrospectively, at least $4.8 million will have to be paid to those ADF members who have retired unless the MSBS Act is also amended.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Board of Trustees cannot legally withhold the double benefit in question from members who claim it, it is proposed to write to those members affected and explain the situation to them, clearly indicating that if they choose to access the double benefit on exit, it will be repayable to the Commonwealth after the passage of the amending legislation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) There is no empirical evidence available to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission (AWRC) to suggest deterioration to wool's characteristics as a result of the length of time or form of storage.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr Dawkins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the question relates to the market value of shares, it is assumed that it is directed at the new income tax measures which were implemented on 1 January 1993, namely, the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) measures. The measures operate to accrue income to an Australian resident from the holding of a share in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign trust. These foreign companies and trusts are referred to as foreign investment funds (FIFs).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the limited amount of information provided in the question, it is not possible to determine whether an amount of tax is payable because of a fluctuation in the price of the shares. The reason is that, in order to narrow the focus of the FIF measures to only target those investments that provide the greatest opportunity for deferral of Australian tax, there are a significant number of exemptions. Some of the major exemptions are for:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) individuals with FIF interests, including those of their associates, that do not exceed $50,000;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) direct investments in foreign companies which are principally engaged in active businesses;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) certain interests in foreign banks, insurance companies, real property companies and specified multi-industry companies;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) interests in FIFs that are trading stock;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) certain balanced investment portfolios;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f) Australian residents who are taxed under the controlled foreign company and transferor trust measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Australian taxpayer is not covered by one of the FIF exemptions, there are three possible methods of calculating the amount of FIF income to be included in the taxpayer's assessable income. These are the market value method, the deemed rate of return method and the calculation method. Given that your question provides information relating to fluctuations in the market value of shares, I will assume that the market value method would be appropriate to the circumstances of the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the FIF measures did not commence until 1 January 1993, the market value of the shares on 23 September 1992 is not relevant. However, I will assume that, at the relevant day (i.e., 31 December 1992) for the taxpayer's current income year (i.e., 1992/93 income year), the market value of the shares is $3.00. Given that the taxpayer's 1992/93 income year would normally end on 30 June 1993, the market value of the shares on 23 September 1993 would also not be relevant. However, I will assume that the market value on 30 June 1993 is $4.00.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of these assumptions, during the relevant period (i.e., from 1 January 1993 to 30 June 1993) the market value of the shares has increased by $1.00. Assuming that no transactions had taken place in relation to these shares during the relevant period, an amount (called FIF income) of $1.00 times the number of shares would be included in the taxpayer's assessable income for the 1992/93 income year and would be taxed at the taxpayer's marginal rate of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reply to this question, it is also assumed that, during the relevant period, the shares were not sold by the taxpayer. In the event that the shares were sold, the normal capital gains tax provisions of the income tax law would apply instead of the FIF measures.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(a)(b)&amp;(c) 271 skeletal remains from the Edinburgh University are being held in Canberra under the provisions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. Copies of documentation provided by the Edinburgh University were provided in l991 to the relevant State and Territory Governments, with the request that the skeletal remains be collected from Canberra and, following consultations with the communities of origin, returned to these communities. However the Edinburgh University was only able to provide poor and inadequate documentation on a considerable proportion of the collection. To address this particular issue, ATSIC is to commission a report which is to provide advice on how best to proceed with returning skeletal material where as yet it has not been possible to identify the exact areas or places of origin.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The return of the 299 skeletal remains from the Edinburgh University occurred because of a decision of that University to return the remains to Australia.
