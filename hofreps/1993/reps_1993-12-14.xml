<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to reports in this morning's media that Treasury has significantly upgraded its forecasts for the performance of the economy in the current financial year. Can the Treasurer provide the House with any further information on the forecasts?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3903" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At about this time each year, following the publication of the September quarter national accounts, the Treasury, along with other Commonwealth agencies, engages in a review of the forecasts for the current financial year. That review of the forecasts has not been completed yet, but the Treasury has given me advice about its views on the forecasts for the current financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to GDP growth, it expects that now to be in excess of three per cent, compared with the budget time forecast of 2 3/4 per cent. In relation to inflation, the forecast has been reduced from the 3 1/2 per cent at budget time to under three per cent now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will dwell on those two figures for a moment. The fact that we have got growth above three per cent and inflation below three per cent is quite frankly a magic combination. It is a very long time since Australia has seen its inflation rate below that of its growth. Herein lies the key to our economic progress over the next few years: the fact that we can have strengthening economic growth whilst at the same time maintaining a low level of CPI measured inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other encouraging advice from the Treasury is an upgrading of its employment growth forecasts from the budget time figure of three-quarters of a per cent to something around 1 1/4 per cent or a little more now. This means that there is an expectation that the growth we have seen on the job front since the beginning of this financial year&mdash;where 100,000 jobs have been added&mdash;will continue for the rest of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It probably is not possible to expect that there will be simply a continuation of the current rate of job growth that we have seen over the last five months. There are all kinds of seasonal and other factors which come into play. Bearing in mind that the budget time forecast was for 100,000 jobs for the entire financial year and that that figure has already been achieved, it is clearly the case that there will be a growth in jobs well in excess of that anticipated at the time of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just a question of a set of measurements being relayed into forecasts; it is also a question of the measurement of business and consumer confidence. There have been a number of surveys recently, the most recent of which being the BCA survey, to which the Prime Minister referred yesterday. There have been others, including from the National Australia Bank, Dun and Bradstreet, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and so on, and they have been recording a pick-up in business confidence. As well as that, we have seen from the Westpac-Melbourne Institute work that the measure of consumer confidence rose in trend terms in December to reach a five-year high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are very good signs for the Australian economy and, again, they are underpinned by concrete evidence of some very  important changes to the composition of growth. This was revealed in the latest national accounts figures, which show that it is the private sector rather than the public sector which is making the stronger contribution to growth. This is entirely consistent with what the government had in mind when it decided to provide a stimulus through the public sector from the time of the One Nation statement and from the subsequent two budgets. It was anticipated that, as that public expenditure did its work in the economy and as it began to trail off, we would see a pick-up in private sector activity of precisely the kind that we are seeing now, which is providing the fortification for the continuation of the recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in the area of business investment, which has of course been disappointingly low, if we look at the last national account figures, we see that both plant and equipment and non-dwelling construction expenditure grew strongly in the September quarter. So underlying business investment has been improving over 1993 and has increased by a strong six per cent in the September quarter. We are seeing these forecasts being upgraded and, as well as that, we are seeing that fortified by growth in business investment, improvements in business expectations and improvements in consumer confidence. I think we are seeing not only the real evidence of jobs being created but also improvements on the job vacancy front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury is not alone in making these more optimistic assessments of the economy. BT Australia has provided a comparison of its forecasts with the average forecasts of those economists polled by the AFR and published on 10 December. We see from both the BT forecast and the average of the others that they are all forecasting for 1993-94 growth rates, inflation rates and employment growth of the kind of magnitude which the Treasury now thinks will provide the underpinning for the revised forecasts for official purposes. This is good news for Australia and it confirms the sense of economic policy that we have been pursuing for the last couple of years. Our task now is to see this recovery broaden and strengthen and see the benefits of it flow to more and more Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories to the grant of $200,000 to the Mount Gravatt Workers Club. As the club did not officially exist when the grant was announced in January 1993, nor had it received Brisbane City Council approval for its project, was a needs criteria used in making this grant? If so, how does the minister justify refusing a grant of just $30,000 to the Logan City Council to expand sporting facilities at Underwood Park in the Liberal held Fadden electorate to allow all-year use of the oval for cricket, soccer, softball and athletics? As this project would have catered for six of the seven target groups under the program, including communities with high unemployment, large migrant populations and youth and residents in inner urban areas, what grounds did the minister have for rejecting this application in favour of the Mount Gravatt project other than the political requirement to protect the marginal ALP seat of Moreton?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can he tell the House whether a new world trade deal is likely this week? Does he believe that a good outcome to the Uruguay Round would boost the world economy and would it support the expansion of the Australian economy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3904" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I am delighted to be able to inform the House that the world is now within reach of a very favourable outcome to the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations under the GATT. These negotiations began seven years ago. This government has never wavered in its commitment of time, resources and energy to fight for a result which would take the monkey of agricultural protectionism off the back of our farmers and which would help our service exports and our manufactured exports. We will know for sure in 48 hours the precise outcome of the round but my judgment is that the overall result of the round will be good for the major economies, good for Australia and good for the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's trade minister, Senator Cook, is now in Geneva, fighting for the best possible outcome on commodities of particular interest to us in markets of particular interest to us. We will see those results later in the week. Indeed, it needs to be recorded that Senator Cook has played a very important and energetic role in these closing months of the round, no less so in these closing days of the round when he has had some considerable success in improving the market access questions and maintaining markets for Australia in particular areas in particular commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth recording that it was very encouraging that the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Hosokawa, had the wisdom and&mdash;in the context of the Japanese political system&mdash;the bravery to beat down his opposition and declare this morning that Japan will open its rice market. I congratulate him on a wise and profoundly important decision and one that has never been capable of being made in years gone by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, late last week we saw President Kim Young-Sam of Korea announce the opening of the Korean rice market, which was another wise and difficult decision taken by one of the most eminent and far-sighted of Asian statesmen. Japan will be opening its very lucrative market in 1995 to around 400,000 tonnes of imported rice equivalent to four per cent of domestic production. Over six years, from 1995 to the year 2000, that access will expand to 800,000 tonnes. The Japanese market for imported rice in the year 2000 will therefore be almost double Australia's current level of total rice exports which are valued at around $230 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now know that we have a new deal in agriculture which will mean major cuts to export subsidies, border protection and internal supports. We know that we are going to see some very useful cuts to protection against industrial goods. We will see service exports enhanced. For the Australian economy, which still relies on commodity exports but which in recent years has tripled both its service exports and its manufacturing exports, the balance of the package is very favourable indeed. The global impact of the Uruguay Round, as it is presently shaping up, may add around $400 billion annually to world GDP when the reforms are fully implemented. Australia stands to gain around $2 1/2 billion in GDP and tens of thousands of new jobs as a consequence of these more open and liberal trading rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the imminent conclusion of the new world trade agreement adds to the good news which we have already seen in our economy. As the Treasurer said a moment ago, the Treasury is revising up its growth forecast for this year. A hundred thousand jobs have been created in the last three months. The growth recorded in the economy was 3.4 per cent over the year to the last quarter. This comes at a time when we have, as the Treasurer again reminded the House, low inflation. With the potential of an opening up of trading opportunities under the GATT, I think this bodes well for the economy in the mid- to late-1990s&mdash;particularly as we see GDP accelerating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, could I again just reiterate that seven years of prodigious effort into the GATT round seems to be paying off. The government has devoted a tremendous amount of energy to it. I think it will prove to be a substantial boon for Australia to our earnings potential, to our GDP and to building on the things that we are now doing domestically, as the Treasurer said a moment ago, to lift employment and incomes and to make the Australian economy so much better and stronger in the 1990s.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. On 1 December, Senator McMullan wrote to the arts community saying that arts grants are made on an arm's length peer review basis `to ensure politicians do not have a say in deciding who is awarded grants'. If it is important that politicians do not have a say in who is awarded arts grants, why is it not important that politicians do not have a say in who is awarded sports and cultural grants? Why did the minister take it on herself to personally decide who received sports and cultural grants rather than have it done at arm's length by her department?</PARA></TALK.START>

In 1992 we had a 19 per cent growth in the number of Japanese citizens coming to Australia, bringing the number to 630,000, who spend money and create jobs in our country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, despite the fact that the Japanese economy is in recession&mdash;unlike the Australian economy&mdash;and the fact that outbound travel from Japan has declined, in the first nine months of this year Australia has had a six per cent growth in the number of Japanese travellers coming to Australia. So our market share is increasing. One Japanese wholesaler said to me that, in a declining market, Australia is the only area where there is growth. That is something which we will ensure continues, because the Tourist Commission will spend over $13 million this year in trying to encourage more Japanese travellers to come to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know a lot of people claim that Japanese travellers pre-purchase packages and not much money comes to Australia. I got the figures out. The value to Australia of prepaid package Japanese tourists is estimated to be more than $400 million. In addition, they spend more than $700 million while they are here. Mr Speaker, next time you are on one of the scenic beaches in Wollongong and see a Japanese couple and you are thinking of offering to take their photograph, just think that that couple has probably contributed more than $4,000 to the Australian economy in export earnings. They probably deserve to have their photograph taken.</PARA>

We hope to have the agreement signed with New South Wales later this week, with other states following soon after.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Partnership Australia will ensure that we get more bang for the dollar in the money that the Commonwealth and the states spend overseas in promoting Australia as a tourist destination. That program will help fund a centralised information service for overseas visitors and travel agents and will ensure, for example, that if a state wants to have a cooperative tactical marketing campaign&mdash;perhaps sending letters by direct mail to travel agents in Singapore, Malaysia or other countries&mdash;this can be done under Partnership Australia with the Commonwealth and the states sharing the cost. Partnership Australia will completely revolutionise the way we promote Australia as a destination for tourists.

Since 1987 when the scheme was first announced, the domestic value added in pharmaceutical exports has risen from $50 million per annum to some $200 million.

Just to give honourable members some sense of the dimensions of this, the companies have committed to cumulative replacement more than $2.5 billion worth of imports to 1999 and over the same period achieve exports of some $680 million.

Successful commercialisation of the drug would bring returns of over $2 billion. This market is absolutely huge. This product can be sold anywhere in the world where people can say `aitchoo'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do believe it, and the Leader of the Opposition ought to understand it because they believe it. The Leader of the Opposition should understand the reason why the National Farmers Federation has been calling on all opposition members, particularly this National Party group over here, to get behind and back the legislation. In Western Australia, where a lot of this concern exists, under the West Australian legislation there is no effective validation pre-1975 and no certainty as to sensibly dealing with future land grants. So if opposition members are genuinely concerned about the future certainty attaching to farming properties, they ought to get behind the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of the question concerned financial assistance. As part of the Mabo package, the government said that it is prepared in test cases to ensure that, where financial assistance is given to one side, it will also be made available to the other. The decision on whether or not financial assistance is given will not be based on the opposition's silly notion of a hardship test but on a recommendation from the Attorney-General, who will be advised by a committee on which will sit a representative of the National Farmers Federation. That is the commitment that we gave the National Farmers Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that the executive director of that organisation was not only prepared to support the government's position on Mabo but also prepared&mdash;and succeeded in doing so&mdash;to carry the whole of the National Farmers Federation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. The national mental health strategy was released in June last year, providing a framework where, for the first time, the Commonwealth would work together with the states in a detailed way, particularly in the development of community based services for people with mental illness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mental illness is extremely widespread within the community. Indeed, quite a high proportion of the population at any one time may well experience serious mental illness or mental problems. So the development of a mental health strategy was very important. It preceded the release of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report by Brian Burdekin, which was a comprehensive airing of a range of issues relating to services available for people with mental illness.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the Leader of the Opposition requested a briefing from Brian Burdekin on his report but, apparently, the opposition is not interested in hearing about this particular issue. The Burdekin report followed the development of a national mental health strategy. The Commonwealth spends something like $2.5 billion a year in assistance for people who are mentally ill, through both income support and Medicare measures. The national mental health strategy will add $135 million to that over five years for particular programs that will care for people at a community level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Brian Burdekin pointed out in his report, the question of mental illness is not one of going back to institutionalisation but of moving forward to improve services at a community level. That is very much in line with what the Commonwealth is doing through the national mental health strategy: targeting funds for services that either enable people to be cared for in acute hospitals close to where their families live so that they have normal visiting support, or provide housing and other services at a community level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we build on the national mental health strategy. The Attorney-General and I have established a task force at Commonwealth level that will examine in some detail the Burdekin report and its recommendations which go to many areas of public policy at both the Commonwealth and state levels. We will do that in a way which will allow us to consult relevant ministers at state level in March or April next year and to respond to the Burdekin report overall in 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the opposition, the government takes policy very seriously and we recognise where we need to develop policy on the basis of programs. We also need to be thinking across programs and across levels of government. In the national mental health strategy we anticipate that approach and, in our response to Burdekin, will take that approach further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of mental health in this community is a serious problem&mdash;it is not a simple problem&mdash;and it requires complex solutions and a change in culture. So the Commonwealth will work with the states to achieve a much more comprehensive approach to mental health care and treatment than we have ever seen before in this country for people who are mentally ill. That builds on this government's record on social policy, which has been to take issues that need to be tackled at their roots and deal with them across programs and, if necessary, across levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we respond to Burdekin, I think it will be clear to all honourable members of this House that it is a serious response worthy of Burdekin's report. It was a very comprehensive report indeed. For most Australians, the report was certainly very salutary and one to be taken very seriously. That is the way the government will respond to it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Special Minister for State. Is the minister aware that CRA has an annual exploration budget of $80 million and that it intends increasing exploration spending overseas by more than 50 per cent in an attempt to escape the effects of the government's native title legislation? To quote John Ralph, `We are not putting our eggs in an uncertain basket'. Does the minister agree that the government's legislation will have adverse effects on the mining industry, costing jobs in rural areas for Australians, including those in Aboriginal communities? Is it a fact that a huge wedge will now be driven between freehold and leasehold title?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3910" SPEAKER="Walker The Hon F.J." NAMEID="9T4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ROBERTSON" MINISTERIAL="SPECIAL MINISTER OF STATE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9T4">Mr WALKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the Leader of the National Party, I read the papers in the morning. I did see a report, particularly in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, that quoted a few figures. Naturally, I had my officers check those figures immediately. It would appear that the figures in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> were wrong and that CRA is actually reducing its exploration budget only by $8 million in the year. One would imagine that that is a pretty understandable thing. CRA, having been a very successful explorer, at the moment owns with subsidiary companies the largest alumina mine in the world and is about to substantially expand it. It has discovered what is probably the largest lead, zinc and silver deposit in the world and is about to develop that. Obviously it has been doing a lot of very successful exploration in this country. One can imagine it might not be so enthusiastic about spending a great deal more in Australia this year. These mining companies spend huge figures in exploration and $8 million, quite frankly, is peanuts. It is the sort of money that AMIC would spend on the campaign against the Native Title Bill. It is really peanuts. So I am not surprised that there is a slight downturn in CRA's exploration budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ralph, in his statement, said that he is concerned with the native title legislation. He said that the reason the mining companies are not spending more money in Australia and will be spending more money elsewhere is that native title holders have been given a de facto right of veto in the Native Title Bill. I would like to make the statement that we have all made a dozen times: this is not the case at all. There is no right of veto for native title owners in the bill. There is a right of negotiation, but there is no right of veto; that is perfectly clear. I do not know how many times we have to repeat that. The bill is as clear as crystal on that issue and there is no reason that miners should be concerned at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have a look at how well CRA is doing at the moment under this government, we see in its annual report that its shares have gone up in April from $13.46 to $17.90. Under the tender, loving care of this government, CRA is on a bonanza and it should not be too concerned. In his statement in the annual report to the shareholders about the native title legislation, Mr Ralph said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We share the concern felt by the rest of the industry that unless the uncertainties raised by the High Court decision are resolved soon by complementary State and Commonwealth Government Legislation, exploration funds and investment funds will be increasingly be directed overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>To his shareholders&mdash;the ones that count to Mr Ralph&mdash;he is saying that, unless the government bill goes through this parliament, there is going to be uncertainty and there are going to be reductions in these sorts of funds. I think we are getting a bit of a double message here. The fact of the matter is that the reduction of exploration expenditure by these huge mining companies is a very small one. The bill is about to go through the upper House. The uncertainty will be removed and the mining industry in this country will do very well, as it already is out of this government.</PARA>

Can the minister comment on the accuracy of this report?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3911" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen the report and it is very flattering to this country. As the honourable member for Moreton said, it claims that we have the second highest expenditure per student relative to per capita GDP in the OECD. It also pointed out that tertiary education has the highest share of total educational expenditure in the OECD&mdash;some 36 per cent compared with the OECD average of about 28 per cent. It indicates that about $10,400 is spent per student from public and private resources. That is the second highest expenditure per student in the OECD.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a few differences with the article over its methodology and measurement, but the basic thrust of its story is correct in terms of the devotion of this government to effective expenditures in the tertiary sector. In this triennium we are spending some $14 billion. I have recently announced that by 1996 the annual expenditure will be close to $5 billion and that will include an additional 1,500 places. Between 1989 and 1998, therefore, something like 100,000 additional places will have been created in the higher education sector by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are now some 580,000 people studying in our higher education institutions out of a population of 17.6 million people, giving a total ratio of population of about 3.3 per cent. If we compare this with the UK, where there are 728,000 people studying out of a population of about 57 million people, we find that the percentage of the population is 1.28 per cent. Because of these sorts of statistics, the Commonwealth has decided that it needs to direct a growth in education expenditure more forcefully into the vocational sector of post-secondary education and a number of measures were put in place in this budget as part of that process. One of those measures that was put into place to respond to these sorts of developments, mentioned by the honourable member for Moreton in his question, was a decision that we took to encourage the direction of spending to go towards school leavers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one of the small measures we put in place to encourage that growth, we decided that people taking a second degree should pay twice the level of HECS. They do not have to pay it up front. But, over time, if they want to avail themselves of a heavily subsidised place and continue in that heavily subsidised place, they should in fact be responsible for picking up double HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice today that the opposition, which tells us that it has no trouble cutting $10 billion off outlays, has failed to jump this hurdle. As far as those opposite are concerned, they are going to oppose it in the Senate. This bunch of Don Quixote budget cutters was going to charge at a windmill with $10 billion whirring around and around. But somebody threw a pebble in front of the horse&mdash;about $4 million&mdash;and, crash, down the horse came when it was confronted with actually being obliged to do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition needs to understand one or two things about this proposition. First, even though we have expanded places very substantially, the substantial proportion of those places has gone to mature age students and students doing second degrees. Indeed, school leavers have missed out somewhat&mdash;inadvertently, as far as this government is concerned&mdash;over that period of time. It is a situation that we are trying to redress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has to be understood is that every person who does a second degree&mdash;this is a zero sum gain&mdash;does so at the expense of a student, a school leaver, who is on the margin with his or her results. And that base level has been shifting higher and higher. So the opposition has said that people who have already had one bite of the cherry should be now unfettered to have two bites of the cherry and the youngster trying to get a place can go and whistle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently the opposition has also said in this regard that it discriminates against migrants. It has said that if people had degrees from overseas that were not recognised here and had not been paid for by the Australian taxpayer they would be in a situation where they would be paying double HECS unfairly. That is nonsense. If people have unrecognised degrees from overseas they are not charged double HECS. We can set their minds at rest completely as far as that is concerned. That was one piece of nonsense in the press release of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point is that if it happens to be a professional qualification which is being sought&mdash;such as a nursing qualification, a diploma of education, moving on to a doctors degree&mdash;they also get it at single HECS. This is a minor saving; a first step at preserving and advancing the equity in the system. The opposition will have to go down the road chopping absolute scads if it is going to be able to achieve anything like the sorts of expenditure cuts&mdash;$10 billion off outlays&mdash;it has been talking about. But those opposite have not been able to come up to the mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I make is in terms of the numbers of people that have commented about our tertiary system and the praise that has been given us by the OECD in that regard. How nice it is to be lectured on questions of equity by people who have not repudiated their Fightback policies on education and intend to charge not double HECS but up-front fees for every single student who enters tertiary education, irrespective of his or her capacity to pay.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If ever there was an issue that was bitterly dividing the cabinet and the parliamentary Labor Party, it is the issue of the jobs levy. For example, on the one hand, we have the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) who, above all, is arguing for the imposition of this tax increase on Australians. He is supported by a whole range of caucus members who this morning during doorstops as they walked into the House expressed their enthusiasm for the jobs levy. On the other hand, we have the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) trying to kill off the jobs levy by leaking material from the Treasury to selected newspapers today and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) not quite wishing at this stage to declare his hand, in a way that shows lack of leadership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the issue of the jobs levy is one that really strikes at the heart of the problem of this government, which is that the Keating government wears high unemployment as a badge of shame. The Keating government has put a million people in this country out of work and is now desperately casting around for little more than excuses for what it has done to Australians. Here we have a situation where, since its foundation in the 1890s, the Labor Party has pretended&mdash;this is one of the great confections of history&mdash;to be a political party with compassion and concern. But when the Labor Party is in power the reality is that it is a party which cannot handle money, cannot be trusted with the taxpayers' cheque book and, in the end, puts people out of work. Federally, this present government has put a million people out of work and&mdash;if honourable members can remember them any more&mdash;state Labor governments around Australia compounded the problems. There we have the reality of Labor, which is such a far cry from its rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the Prime Minister and the Treasurer talked about the cyclical upturn in the economy. Of course there is a cyclical upturn in the economy. All economies go through cycles. That has always been the case and always will be. The test is not whether Australia goes through a cyclical upturn or not&mdash;of course it will&mdash;but whether, as a result of that, there will be a substantial reduction in unemployment in this country to levels which are regarded as acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the claims about the creation of jobs that we heard today from the Treasurer, the fact is that not enough jobs will be created to significantly reduce the rate of unemployment in Australia. There are two reasons why that is the case. First of all, there is inevitably a natural growth in the labour market in this country. I do not need to say much more about that&mdash;it is perfectly obvious. Secondly, the participation rate in the labour market has declined quite significantly since it reached its peak in July 1990. Now the participation rate is starting to climb back up again. If we had the participation rate in our labour market today that we had in July 1990, there would be 125,000 more people out of work today than the unemployment statistics show. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Bruce interjects, by choice. Of course, this is the government's choice&mdash;not the people's choice. The simple fact is that 125,000 more people today would be out of work&mdash;or an unemployment rate of 12 1/2 per cent&mdash;if we had the peak participation rate of July 1990. If we took the average of the 1990-91 financial year, 70,000 more people would be out of work, which is an 11.9 per cent unemployment rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this tell us? This tells us that an enormous number of Australians simply gave away the task of looking for work. Some of those people, on hearing statements like those we have heard from the Treasurer in the last few days, are coming back into the work force, but the economy is not growing sufficiently quickly to absorb the extra burden of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the boasts we are getting, the fact is that for the next two years of this government's life unemployment will remain a very substantial social problem and will be a significant political problem as well for the government. The government concedes effectively that it does not know what to do about it, and it has condemned itself with its own words. Last week, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training said to an ACOSS conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When all the factors associated with the economic cycle are stripped away&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>at least he is honest about that; we are not talking about some miracle or magic; we are talking about this cycle of the economy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">one factor stands out beyond all others&mdash;the level of long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>If we look at the data, we can see how the underlying rate of unemployment in this country, taking the cyclical factors away, has grown substantially over the last 10 years, and the rate of long-term unemployment has simply climbed with it. We now have a government in power that has put a million people out of work, but, as the Secretary to the Treasury has pointed out, it has done so by its own choice. This government has chosen to put those people out of work and, as the Secretary to the Treasury makes clear, it has chosen to keep those people out of work.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That says something for the depth of compassion that there is in the Labor Party, when it pursues policies that deliberately keep people out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the government is sitting down saying, `This is a political problem for us. We had better find a solution'. Like something out of a novel by Franz Kafka or George Orwell, the government has decided that the answer is to set up committees. First of all we had a caucus committee. It made a series of fairly vacuous recommendations, and they have been taken to a task force&mdash;another committee. Tomorrow this task force will produce its report on what to do about unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as though this is a new government. It is not as though it has just come to power and has been presented with the problem of unemployment in the way that the Victorian and South Australian governments have been. It is not as though it is in that situation. It has been in power for 10 3/4 years. After over 10 years, the Labor Party has decided to set up a committee to examine whether it is possible to reduce unemployment. That is really quite an extraordinary dereliction of duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only solution that will come out of this report&mdash;we already know this&mdash;is for the government to spend taxpayers' money on public sector job creation programs. As the Reserve Bank paper that we circulated enthusiastically yesterday said, these job creation programs amount to ways of seeking to live with or disguise the problem of unemployment. That is exactly what the government is trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tomorrow the green paper will come out and it will have something which is described as a job compact. One of the recommendations in the green paper will be to spend $2 billion of taxpayers' money on jobs which will last for a mere six months. At the end of six months, that will be it; the unemployed will be back on the dole. So an amount of $2 billion will be spent effectively as compensation for policy failure. The task force's green paper will concede that unemployment under the present government's policies will, at the very best, not fall below seven per cent by the year 2000. The question that is left begging is: if $2 billion is going to be spent on what is called a job compact, where is the money going to come from?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the government to turn around now and say that it should be spending more money on labour market programs is a quite extraordinary thing because in the budget  the government proposed to cut labour market program spending in the next financial year by 31 per cent. So at one stage when the budget was being drafted the government was not quite so keen on labour market programs, but suddenly it decided, using the green paper as a way of getting the debate up, that it needed to spend a further $2 billion on labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way the government can finance these labour market programs is by either reducing spending in other areas or increasing taxation. There is one other option: the government can abandon its deficit reduction strategy, but the consequence of that would be a blow-out in interest rates. Presumably, the government does not want to do that. It would be a tragedy for the country if the government went on yet another of its periodic and massive spending sprees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is going to stick to its deficit reduction strategy for the time being&mdash;in the end, I suspect it will not&mdash;it will have to come up with a way of raising $2 billion. Some people might say, `You can raise that money by cutting spending', but that is not the view of the Prime Minister. On 18 August, the Prime Minister said that anybody who proposed cuts in government outlays was `either an extremist or a fool'. Is everybody in the government, including the Prime Minister, an extremist or a fool?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must get that in, yes&mdash;a dogs levy, not a jobs levy, in the case of the honourable member for the Northern Territory. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are going around, saying, `We're not in favour of the jobs levy and it will not happen'. If it will not happen, how will the government raise $2 billion to fund these programs? We know only too well that the way the government is going to do it is by finding methods of increasing the burden of taxation on Australians other than by an up-front, in bright lights jobs levy because, as those opposite know, a jobs levy is political speak for a tax hike.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A tax hike will not create jobs; it will cost jobs. No government in the world has ever got people back into work by increasing taxes. Those opposite know nothing about how to manage an economy and absolutely nothing about managing money at all, but they might like to consider the simple proposition that no-one has ever put people back into work through increasing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not going to go for a jobs levy per se; it is going to find surreptitious, backdoor ways of increasing the burden of taxation on Australians. The government can rest assured that we will be picking out those ways and telling Australians over and again that these are further examples of the government's breach of confidence and its betrayal of the Australian electorate. And this is from a government that was elected on a no-tax-hike promise which it has abandoned straightaway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only will the government's tax-and-spend formula not work to reduce unemployment, but it is also an abrogation of its responsibility to pursue the right policies to achieve that. We need substantial economic growth to reduce unemployment. We need to find ways of encouraging investment by reducing the tax burden on businesses, and that includes the administrative burden on businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the one thing the Labor Party will never do is improve the flexibility of the labour market. Despite the rhetoric that the government has adopted about labour market deregulation, all its Industrial Relations Bill does is entrench the privileges of union bosses. There is not a business person in Australia who thinks the government's legislation will create jobs through flexibility in the labour market. There is not a serious economist in this country, from the Secretary to the Treasury to the Governor of the Reserve Bank on downwards, who does not think the answer to the unemployment problem is, above all, greater flexibility in the labour market. The government will not do it because it wants to stick with its union mates. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is more the little regard we hold for the honourable member, so he would do well not to raise that matter.

He has no particular interest in the matter and has made a political response to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all agree that long-term unemployment is a very difficult matter indeed to deal with. However, those opposite have chosen not to produce solutions or ideas but rather make political speeches and score points without any genuine interest in the topic whatsoever. It seems to me that opposition members have ever had only one response&mdash;they continue to harp on it&mdash;that all problems of the labour market and unemployment rest with the workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those problems do not rest with the workers, and they have not for a very long time. It is true that during the 1980s, as is the case today, the ratio between profits and wages, for instance, was so high as to make a nonsense of the argument that wages are the most important factor in the employment of Australian workers. The fact is that wages are not the key factor. A jobs levy is not the key factor. A jobs levy is one small part of a very large number of variables that we, as a government, have the responsibility for tackling and putting into place so that we can ensure that the long-term unemployed have the best chance possible of re-entering the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mayo quoted the views of the Reserve Bank of Australia on public sector job creation. He failed to tell us that the Reserve Bank made quite clear that the government has a role in spending taxpayers' dollars to keep the unemployed job-ready. We have done that in the last several years. The proper role of the public sector of Australia in spending taxpayers' dollars is to ensure that any Australian who has been unemployed for a significant period should not fall out of the work force forever but should be re-employed and given an opportunity to participate in the jobs now being created by the private sector. I remind the honourable member for Mayo that those jobs were previously stimulated by the public sector through our One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other than the opposition's obsession with wages, what are the other factors that are the true determinants of how many Australians will work in the Australian labour market henceforth? The real determinants are inflation, the ratio of profits to wages, the participation rate, private sector job creation, private sector confidence, a good industrial relations climate&mdash;which we have produced&mdash;and the ratio of productivity to wages. Wage rises are not a problem provided there is the productivity to pay for those wage rises. Forgive me for going back in history, but the last time the mob opposite were in power was from 1977 to 1983. In the seven years in which the opposition had an opportunity to produce a more productive labour force&mdash;that is, a labour force that would in itself produce the goods and services that create jobs&mdash;not once did it choose to raise a national productivity case in Australia. When the opposition was in government, not once did it suggest before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that a central part of job creation as well as wealth creation in this country should be productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the enduring mark of the last four or five years of this government's industrial relations is not only the lack of strikes&mdash;in other words, a very settled level of industrial relations&mdash;but the fact that productivity should be the core of negotiations between bosses and workers on the question of wages. Wages should rise, not just in response to inflation&mdash;which is now low because of us&mdash;but in response to the level of production per worker that can be arranged in any specific workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We got it right. We have understood the relationship between productivity, wages and output&mdash;as members of the opposition never have and never could. They have always pretended to have understood how real jobs are created&mdash;whatever they are. Presumably, they mean jobs in the private sector. We understand that better than anyone. We have reworked the entire nature of industrial relations so that productivity becomes the central heart and core of negotiations between workers and bosses, such that people do not pay themselves more than they can produce. While ever that is firmly kept up front in negotiations, wages are not an important factor in the creation of jobs or the denial of job creation, provided productivity is being rewarded. We put that all into place where those opposite patently failed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a promise at the last election that we would not forget the unemployed. We understand that there is a very large number of unemployed Australians, people who have been unemployed for a year or more. But we did not abandon them throughout the torrent of the last election, when it would be expected of a government to put aside a million Australians and go for the votes of the other nine million or 10 million. But we did not. We always said we would return to our core principles&mdash;to ensure that all Australians have a chance at employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us keep in mind the context. If the private sector is not going to produce enough jobs for Australians, should we leave that alone and do nothing else? Should we disregard the important weight of evidence which suggests that the public sector has a role in getting people at least job ready; ready to enter the labour market? Has it a role, as it did through the One Nation statement, of producing jobs until such time as the private sector can produce sufficient jobs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should remember always that unemployment is not so much a question of economics as of sociology. In the 1950s, about half the people over the age of 15 or 16 chose to work in the labour market. Today, over 60 per cent of people choose to enter the labour market. That is what we call the participation rate. That rate has changed little in the last few years; it has changed massively since World War II, so massively that the Australian labour market has had to cope, no matter the flavour of the government, with so many more people who wish to be part of paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I predict that the green paper tomorrow will spend quite a bit of time debating the participation rate. We will not be saying that people ought not have the right to participate and we would not suggest that people withdraw from the labour market. But we might suggest there are other roles people can play better than that of being on the dole. It is correct to say that at the moment the choice is too brutal; those in employment and those out of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is probably a role for those who are young, under 19 or 20, to continue in education. We have done well in that area in the last 10 years. It is probably true to say that those who wish to retire&mdash;perhaps at 60 in the case of men who cannot retire and get the age pension until 65, but are unable to keep a job&mdash;should do so. We announced that at the last election. If people are chronically unemployed, they can remove themselves from the labour market, but have the dignity of knowing they have income support. Let us not forget dignity in all this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over there we have a brutal response to the difficult question of long-term unemployment. We would prefer a dignified response; that is, if there are decent roles the people who are now attempting to participate or are participating in the labour market could otherwise play, then let them play those roles and let us assist them&mdash;young ones in education and older ones in withdrawing from the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider this proposition. We know that many couples who are bringing up very young children at the moment would prefer not to be in the labour market. Both parents have said that they are forced to work because they need to, for whatever reason&mdash;to pay off a mortgage, a car or to bring up children, and so on. There is an expressed need on behalf of a very large number of parents looking after young children which suggests that they would like to withdraw from the labour force; that is, there would be a lower participation rate. Could they have some other form of support?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that these are the sorts of decent, intelligent ideas that will be produced tomorrow in the green paper&mdash;ideas that do not confront nor are an affront to Australian workers, nor to the unemployed, but rather are a significant recognition that in every sophisticated economy in this world not enough jobs are produced for the people who want them. We produce enough wealth; we do not produce enough jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the obsession with wages as the one response to producing enough jobs is patently inadequate. Those opposite are inadequate in such a difficult debate. We have already proved that there are far more powerful determinants on the number of people who will work, so why get obsessed with the question of wages? It is wrong that they should do so. It is appalling that, after 11 years in opposition, they still have only a single response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps we should give them another 11 years to toss it over amongst themselves. I do not mind; they can have as long as they want because on this side of the House we will continue to create ideas that we think will marry the interests of the unemployed and the employed so that they will not compete with each other, cut each other down or be jealous of what each other has or has not got in this society. Rather, our idea is to create a sufficient bond between the two so that both groups can see a way out of this, so that those who are employed receive decent wages, the long-term benefits that come after accruing superannuation, the training that comes with the imposition of a job training levy and the care that comes with insurance and work cover should they become ill at work, fall over or cause damage to themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot just rule out those sorts of things. Superannuation, training and care for those who are sick cannot be ruled out and somehow be deducted from the wages of workers. Those are the decent things for which we have always fought. It is not good enough to wish them away and it is not good enough to suggest that if only we did not have to pay workers we would be able to employ lots of them. We may as well wish away the entire labour market, we may as well wish away the living standards of all employed Australians and we may as well wish we were not in the parliament at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we have worked hard to determine the level of living standards of Australians, which is higher than most of our competitors. We also have a more expensive welfare state than most of our competitors, but that is the real world. We will deal with the real world. Tomorrow we will see a more than decent response on behalf of the Commonwealth Labor government to the question of the long-term unemployed. It is a response that will bring with us all of those who are employed. We will also ask the employed to think about the plight of the unemployed and to ensure that together we continue along this path of decent, equitable responses. </PARA>

In arguing against a jobs levy he said, `A tax is a tax, no matter whether you call it a levy or a surcharge'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary said in his contribution to this debate that, under coalition government, real wages went down, thereby implying that real wages went up during the Australian Labor Party's 10 years in government. I remind him that, taking a baseline of 1984-85, the average wage in constant dollars was then $499.30. On the latest figures available for 1992-93, the average wage is $471.40&mdash;a decrease in average weekly earnings in real terms of 5.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such an illogical, inconsistent argument is epitomised in many ways. Only a couple of months ago we were told that tax cuts would help revive the economy, provide more spending power, stimulate things and lead to more jobs. Today we are told that tax increases will lead to more jobs. This jobs levy idea is the whacko suggestion of the month with all the hallmarks of a typical ALP approach. Typically, the ALP creates a problem through mismanagement, belatedly recognises the problem, expresses concern and tries to fix it with a bandaid approach that only entrenches and exacerbates the problem. We have seen that happen right across Australia: in Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales&mdash;where the ALP was thrown out in 1988&mdash;the Northern Territory, and, as we saw last Saturday, South Australia. We will see it again, federally, at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was absolutely amazed to hear the employment minister support this levy. I would expect the tomato left over there to support it but I was amazed that someone of the minister's stature would support it. I am also amazed that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is even considering this levy, as is half the caucus. Of course, the trade unions are also on side for this off-the-planet idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number one problem in this country today is the one million people unemployed. It has taken this government 10 years to recognise that and 10 years to `suddenly' realise that it has to do something about it. So what does the government do? It does not cut wasteful expenditure and reform the society in which we live. For heaven's sake, all the government can come up with is putting on a new tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government knows that a new tax will not go down too well so it has to cloud and camouflage the issue by calling it a jobs levy. The government has to provide some sort of rationale for it by saying that it will create jobs. The government has to complicate it a bit by putting it on a sliding scale. But it is an absolute nonsense to link taxing jobs with creating jobs. If the government wants to create jobs by using government money it would be more logical to take it out of general revenue or to tax breakfast cereal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government said, `We will tax breakfast cereal and use the money we raise to create jobs', it would be laughed off the treasury bench. However, there is no more logic in taxing jobs than there is in taxing breakfast cereal. The government will end up destroying more jobs than it creates. It is about time the government realised why that is so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At best, a jobs levy will only shuffle the unemployment queues, firstly because of the substitution effect&mdash;something the government has not even thought about&mdash;whereby the comparative advantage between companies that employ labour is altered. Secondly, there is the displacement effect, whereby the composition of the unemployed is merely rearranged&mdash;that is, employers will target subsidised labour groups for recruitment in preference to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Judith Sloan of Flinders University has said that, because of those two effects, for every 100 wage subsidy placements there will be only 20 jobs net created. Even the Department of Finance came out and said that for every 100 jobs that are created for the long-term unemployed, we will end up with only 15 per cent net. I remind honourable members that we have nearly half a million long-term unemployed people in Australia today. If we cast our minds back 20 years and asked how many long-term unemployed people there were then, we would be amazed at the answer. The parliamentary secretaries at the table could not tell us, but the answer is 1,500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other detrimental effects will lower that net figure even more. The government totally overlooks the fact that if the levy is put on low income earners who tend to spend all their money, there will be less spending in the community and less demand for goods&mdash;which is genuine demand&mdash;which will lead to fewer jobs. Even if the government puts the levy at a higher level on high income earners, it means they will spend less, invest less and save less. Therefore, there will be less spending and less investment, and the net effect will be fewer jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the biggest impact&mdash;I think this is the greatest tragedy of all&mdash;will be on small business. Today small business already provides something like six out of every 10 jobs in the economy. Very small business&mdash;those businesses which employ fewer than 20 people&mdash;provides 40 per cent of the work force. Many of these are unincorporated. While businesses employing more than 100 people have shed in excess of 20 per cent of their labour over the last couple of years and those employing between 20 and 100 people have shed in excess of 10 per cent of their labour over the last 10 years, those businesses that employ 40 per cent of the work force&mdash;those that employ fewer than 20 people&mdash;are actually putting on labour. They will be hit hardest by this tax because it will up their tax burden by about 12 1/2 per cent on my calculations. So a jobs levy will specifically hurt the area that is going to be in the best position to increase the number of jobs. The government should take note of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from what I have mentioned, there are other detrimental effects as well. There will be administration costs associated with this levy, there will be spending of the levy in non-productive areas, it will be used to prop up declining industries and things such as that, and it will scare away foreign investment. The Prime Minister has admitted that. So it is no surprise that the economic analysts in this country have come to the conclusion that there is every reason to believe the net effect on employment of levy-type funding schemes is negative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to look at what the Labor Party has been doing over the last couple of years with labour market programs. In the period between 1991-92 and 1993-94 it has doubled spending in this area. We now spend $1,320 million on these programs, hiding away half a million unemployed. The real unemployment figure should probably be up around 16 or 17 per cent. There has been no improvement whatsoever in the unemployment level over that period of time, despite the doubling of spending; it has remained static. The last thing we want is extra money being spent in this area because of such considerations as declining marginal benefits. But, again, the Labor Party would not understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to recognise the real causes of unemployment&mdash;which is something the Labor Party never does. At the end of the day, jobs essentially depend on labour unit costs. New Zealand has recognised that. Its on-costs on things such as payroll tax, training levies, superannuation levies, excess penalty rates, holiday leave loadings and those types of things, are only a third to a half in many industries compared with the levels in Australia. That is why the New Zealand economy is starting to skip ahead as ours is stagnating and falling behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, we need increased labour market flexibility. We do not need such things as the Industrial Relations Reform Bill of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). We also need economic growth. Having more public sector job creation schemes is a very expensive way of assisting the long-term unemployed. The jobs levy is nothing more than another tax. It just reshuffles the unemployment queues and it puts business investment priorities into less efficient areas. The perpetrators of this idea should be condemned and the concept should be abandoned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member for Parkes does not know what is in the green paper tomorrow, why is he putting up this furphy? What is the point of today's debate? For some reason out in the ether a proposition is legitimately put that there may be a jobs levy. The government has not adopted it. It is not a government position. The green paper may raise it as an issue and may even comment upon it. But for some reason the honourable member for Mayo has chosen to have an MPI today on a jobs levy. What a waste of time! He is completely disingenuous when it comes to contributions about the labour market, showing as I said previously an incapacity to understand the issues which are crucial to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members have only to look at the contributions which have already been made today or, indeed, at the media release put out by the shadow Treasurer where he talks about the job levy. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The jobs levy would not create one real job.</PARA>
<PARA>One could debate that, and I am sure that will be debated at some time down the track by those people who might propose such a thing. The shadow Treasurer also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only constructive way to get the long-term unemployed back into the work force is to improve Australia's economic performance and an increase in tax is not a way to speed up economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>It is absolutely true that economic growth is crucial. We all agree with that. That does not seem to be a point of contention. But, in terms of the labour market, to say that economic growth is the only issue is missing the point entirely. The honourable member for Parkes showed his ignorance when he disparagingly commented on the government's expenditure on labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the shadow Treasurer, I have never given him any great credibility. He has proved yet again that he is not worth a bumper. There is no doubt that economic performance is at least, in part, important in terms of the labour market, but it is also important to look at the capacity of those people in the labour market to see whether they have the skills required in that market. That is exactly what the Australian government's labour market programs address&mdash;issues not understood by the opposition; issues which clearly show it does not comprehend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, whilst disparaging the government's performance in the labour market area, has not in today's debate nor in any previous debate on this subject told us what its policies are. We know what the coalition's policies are, because it has made them clear. Apart from the GST, it is sticking to Fightback&mdash;thank you very much! What does Fightback do for employment? The opposition would firstly increase the company tax rate to 42 per cent compared to the government's decision to reduce it to 33 per cent. That is a positive for employment? Imagine what a nine per cent increase in company tax would do to the incentives for businesses to employ more people. The shadow Treasurer was asked by Brian Toohey on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will you put company taxes up to 42% which is what you promised?</PARA>
<PARA>The shadow Treasurer replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as company tax is concerned . . . we'll have a look at what can be done.</PARA>
<PARA>There will be no cuts to other business taxes to compensate for this increase. In reply to another question from Mr Toohey relating to the dumping of the GST, the shadow Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We obviously, as you imply in your question, don't have the financial resources left to abolish sales tax, payroll tax and fuel excise.</PARA>
<PARA>On 15 November in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in an article by David McKenzie, the shadow Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We just cannot afford to abolish those taxes without replacing them with some other form of tax.</PARA>
<PARA>On the question of labour market programs, the article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But he ruled out extra spending on programs to help the long-term unemployed, saying they had been tried around the world on many occasions, and did not create sustainable jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>What would he know? He has not got a clue. Look at what Fightback proposed in the area of job creation and labour market programs. It would have cut labour market programs by&mdash;listen to this&mdash;$435 million. That is roughly a third of this year's expenditure by the Commonwealth government. Taking into account the increase in this year's budget of $120 million over last year's expenditure, those opposite would have had to cut something in the vicinity of $575 million from labour market programs just to meet the target they set out in Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Significantly, Fightback would also have abolished the new enterprise incentive scheme, NEIS; phased out skillshare; and dismembered the Commonwealth Employment Service. That is the opposition's contribution to the issue of labour markets. Those opposite have shown that they do not understand the issues involved in labour market reform and they do not understand the necessity of having appropriate and coherent labour market policies and programs which provide people with the skills they need to compete in the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government understands the issues. As has been acknowledged by this government, it quite properly sees the question of long-term unemployment as being at the core of its social and political agenda. That is something we should be proud of. In order to address it, we have set up a committee of experts who will bring down a green paper looking at the issues involved in employment options. That is a very reasoned response and a responsible attitude which will lead to public debate and eventually to a white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite will be invited to be involved in the debate. But today we have seen, I think, a fairly foolish attempt to pre-empt an aspect of what that debate might be&mdash;that is, if a job levy is proposed, who will propose it and what it might be about. Those opposite are not interested in the harder labour market issues or the need to address the concerns of the long-term unemployed. They are interested in the furphy that somehow or other they are soothsayers and can see what the green paper might bring down and what aspects of it they will or will not agree with. They will find out tomorrow what the green paper says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite should understand this: they have shown again a forlorn and silly attitude when it comes to recognising the needs of people who are unemployed. Those opposite have shown their incapacity to understand the needs of the labour market. They have shown yet again not only by their Fightback policies but also by their inability to recant them&mdash;an attitude which, by definition, says that they will be reinforced&mdash;that they will slash into the labour market programs, impacting drastically upon the way in which the long-term unemployed can compete in the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind those opposite of some of the things that they propose to do. One of the most significant and successful of the government's labour market programs is the new enterprise incentive scheme&mdash;a very successful program. This program builds on what I thought would have been a premise of opposition ideology: it builds on small business. It is about assisting people to set up small businesses. But those opposite want to cut it down. They are proposing to abolish it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme has a 72 per cent success rate. For every 100 NEIS businesses operating for one year, 50 new jobs are created. That is not a bad impact; that is not a bad hit rate for a government program. Yet it is a program which those opposite would deign to cut if they were to be in government. But they will not be in government. Those opposite have demonstrated yet again why the Australian community was dead right when in March of this year it rejected the opposition's proposals not only in terms of taxation but also in all areas of social policy. Labour market program reform, labour market programs and unemployment were crucial issues at the last election&mdash;and those opposite were rejected by the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other dispiriting thing about this whole exercise is not only the willingness of those opposite to not address issues of importance, such as those positive aspects of labour market reform, but also their penchant for having the most negative outlook and reinforcing the worst possible outlook for the economy and the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of highlighting what we can do to beat these problems, those opposite are entrenched in the view that their only road back to government is to see this economy in chaos. This view has been reinforced by every statement from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and by every statement from the shadow Treasurer&mdash;it was reinforced by his contribution today. The government is doing the appropriate thing in terms of labour market reform.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report which I have tabled deals with the RAAF Williams rationalisation project, Laverton, Victoria. RAAF Williams, which comprises Point Cook and Laverton bases, is located 20 kilometres west of the Melbourne central business district and five kilometres from the township of Werribee. The Defence Force structure review rationalised the disposition and functions of all defence units and subsequently, in May 1991, the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, announced that the airfields at Laverton and Point Cook were to be closed or sold. Following the minister's announcement a consultative committee under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) examined the implications of the possible base closures and the impact this would have on local communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal consists of three major items, minor adjusting works and engineering services. The major items are refurbishment of the school of radio building at Laverton to accommodate RAAF Headquarters Logistics Command, which will vacate rented premises in the Melbourne CBD; refurbishment of existing facilities at Laverton to house all elements of the RAAF publications unit; and construction of purpose-built facilities for the RAAF Institute of Aviation Medicine which will be relocated from Point Cook base to RAAF base Edinburgh in South Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While recognising the historical significance of Point Cook and supporting the proposal, the committee does not see the logic of maintaining the two operational bases at Laverton and Point Cook. Apart from the RAAF museum, the committee does not see the necessity for maintaining other units, such as Headquarters Training Command and the RAAF college at Point Cook. Should the National Air and Space Museum be established at Point Cook, then the committee believes the RAAF museum should be incorporated into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends that no further capital works be commenced at RAAF Point Cook and that units located at Point Cook, with the exception of the RAAF museum, be located elsewhere.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Being the member for Lalor, which includes the RAAF Williams base at Laverton and Point Cook, I am deeply interested in the report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Public Works on the RAAF Williams rationalisation project at Laverton. I look forward to reading the full text of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I chaired a consultative committee, appointed by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), which looked at the future use of defence property at RAAF Williams, and which reported to the minister in September 1992. That report was accepted in principle. I would say that the report of the parliamentary committee and the report of the consultative committee are convergent rather than identical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I agree with the broad thrust of the former, it concerns me that its future implications for the Laverton and Point Cook landing strips are still uncertain. For example, it may be that some time in the mid-1990s a decision will be made about the relocation of the Essendon airport. The likely future level of aviation demand in the Port Phillip region suggests that there should be an opportunity for the commercial use not only of Avalon, which is outside the RAAF Williams area and closer to Geelong, but also Point Cook and/or Laverton. Because there are heritage implications associated with Point Cook&mdash;which dates from 1919, making it the oldest airstrip in continuous use in the world&mdash;because this is the area where the RAAF was initiated, it would be very regrettable if aviation activity were to cease altogether down at Point Cook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the recommendation from the committee that, should the National Air and Space Museum of Australia, NASMA, be established at Point Cook&mdash;which is the current feeling of the Victorian government, and of the surviving members of the committee&mdash;the RAAF museum should be integrated with it. I advise the House that there is already a proposition for joint facilities. While there may not be a formal merging of the RAAF museum and NASMA in a technical sense, they will certainly be operating together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sooner or later the future of aviation in the western Port Phillip region will require some very serious decisions&mdash;decisions outside the range of this committee. In the meantime, as the local member, I point out that there will be quite a significant transition of personnel. Essentially, personnel who were working in the central business district will be transferred to Laverton. I am pleased to be able to reassure those members of my electorate who might be listening that the amount of economic activity in the area will undoubtedly remain. The intention is that the total number of defence staff in and around the RAAF Williams area will be slightly increased by the end of this century, although the nature of their activity&mdash;not involving things that go bang or that take off, like the economy&mdash;will be essentially terrestrial. I am grateful for the interest taken by the Standing Committee on Public Works and I look forward to the activity that the committee has recommended taking place quite speedily within the boundary of the Lalor electorate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A request has been made of both managers of government business and they have given undertakings to their opposition counterparts that a certain amount of business will be available to the Senate at the start of next year. As we will be going into a three-session pattern of sittings next year, there will be a requirement for us to provide the House and the Senate with a good block of legislation for consideration when the first session starts. That will be provided for the House by the bills to be introduced during the course of this week. It will be provided for the Senate through this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a possibility that we will sit on Friday, and even later. Apart from debate on matters returned from the Senate, it would not be our intention to debate fresh legislation at that time. It will provide us with an opportunity to discuss the report of the Blewett committee more fully. In addition to ministerial statements and valedictories, it would be our intention to discuss such things on Friday rather than legislation. As I said, apart from any matters coming back from the Senate, the legislation that we wish discussed during the course of this year will be completed by adherence to the program circulated to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will oppose this guillotine. We do so as a measure of our continued unhappiness with the way in which the government has conducted the affairs of the parliament this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again draw the attention of the House to the fact that the current Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has become an almost compulsive guillotiner. I have in front of me a bundle of guillotines that have been moved by him. They started in May after the election. In fact, he became only the third Leader of the House since Federation to move a guillotine in the first two weeks of a parliamentary sitting. I think one of his distinguished predecessors in this was, in fact, him, after the 1990 election. Dredging the memory, I think there was one other occasion stretching back to before the Great War, so it does not happen very often. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then the Leader of the House has elevated it to an art form. We had guillotines on 10 to 13 May, 26 October, 17 November, 18 and 19 October, 28 September and 6 October. Here we are today, 14 December, having another one. It has to be said again that this makes for very unsatisfactory decision making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity to say that there is some improvement in the new parliamentary sitting pattern, if I may put it that way. I have long favoured the idea of having a somewhat shorter break at Christmas and a shorter break in the middle of the year. I have some reservations about the intra-daily sitting arrangements that have come out of the Blewett committee report, particularly as they relate to question time. I am glad that the Leader of the House is foreshadowing that there will be an opportunity to talk about those matters, perhaps early on Saturday morning. I seem to get the impression from what he said that it will be early on Saturday morning. I hope it is at a rather more civilised hour than then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the almost compulsive use of the guillotine and the other sundry abuses of the proper processes of this House and of all Westminster parliaments, the opposition cannot allow this proposal to go unrebuked.

<PARA>The environmental test facility, ETF, is an army unit that undertakes environmental testing of equipment and explosive ordnance to ascertain compliance with defence specifications. The ETF is to be relocated in part from its current location in the Salisbury DSTO complex to Port Wakefield, north of Adelaide, to provide improved facilities for explosive ordnance testing and to eliminate danger to the civil community from testing and from the transport of stressed explosive ordnance from Salisbury to Port Wakefield for firing or destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing facilities at Salisbury are in close proximity to the civilian population and other defence units. This restricts the size and nature of the testing programs undertaken. The explosive ordnance testing function of the ETF will move to recently acquired land adjacent to the existing proof and experimental establishment at Port Wakefield. This proposal will establish approximately 12 test laboratory buildings, control and administration facilities, together with four small explosive storage magazines and the necessary infrastructure on a greenfield site at Port Wakefield. It is anticipated that construction will commence on the site in May 1994 and be completed in December 1995. The estimated outturn cost for this proposal is $8 million.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only a few brief comments to make about the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 because the issues it raises were pretty well canvassed last night. The nature of the 70 per cent of scripts supplied in the last two months and the stockpiling that occurs are key points, as are the reduction of costs and the need for simplification of a relatively complex system. We need to be more aware of the preventative health measures. Of course, overprescribing is an issue that people are already becoming familiar with. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) said that escalating costs were what particularly concerned him. Also of concern is the matter of brand premium&mdash;that is, not allowing our pharmacists to give the lowest priced medication.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the wider context, I think we need to be a little more aware of the impact of medical costs generally on the community. Yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> summed up Senator Richardson's health changes and the proposals he will be putting to cabinet on Thursday. Even though I do not agree with the detail of all the proposed changes, the review is welcome. It is important that we become much more aware of the cost of our health care program&mdash;and, of course, pharmaceuticals come into that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For approximately 20 years, we have seen an assault on individuals who attempt to take some reasonable control of their health costs. We are all aware of the decline in the number of people subscribing to private health insurance. There was a time not that long ago when people were very aware of the cost of health care and of the value of taking out their own insurance. I believe that that is something that the government should focus on more. Of course, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) does not agree with me at all on that point, and that is to be regretted. As far as the pharmaceutical bill is concerned, the same principle applies. As a nation, we have allowed the whole question of the cost of health care to be disguised; consequently, the overall contribution by individuals has not been brought out into the real light of day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 now before the parliament is an omnibus bill that brings together a number of changes to a number of pieces of legislation. I want to take the opportunity in the time that I choose to make available to myself, which will be somewhat less than the normally allotted time of 30 minutes, to address a few remarks to one of the acts which is being amended, the Industrial Relations Act 1988. In doing so, I am  conscious of the fact that we are on the eve of the release of a very important green paper on unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be common agreement across the political divide in this parliament that unemployment is the most serious personal and social problem which faces Australia. It is the social condition that inflicts the most degree of hardship, family trauma, family strain, individual pressure and loss of individual self-esteem on Australians and their families. All of us have an obligation to work together, to the extent that our different views on the subject permit us to do so, to try to find some solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree, as I think anybody who has even the most rudimentary understanding of how the Australian economy works would agree, that there is no solution to the problem of high unemployment divorced from faster economic growth. This country has no hope of making a sizeable reduction in the level of unemployment until it achieves economic growth of four per cent or more and is able to sustain that economic growth of four per cent or more for a considerable period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to there being economic weaknesses which contribute to the high level of unemployment in this country, there are also a number of major structural weaknesses and what I might call micro-economic explanations as to why this country has such high unemployment. If it were simply the case that high unemployment is a function of a recessed economy and that once the recession has ended unemployment would begin to fall, then one might expect, for example, that the rate of unemployment in the United States would still be roughly what it is in Australia. Yet, interestingly enough, the United States has a rate of unemployment of 6.4 per cent and Australia has an unemployment rate of 11.1 per cent. In other words, the jobs recovery in the United States has been much more rapid than it has been in Australia. To those who say that that is completely the result of there being much lower minimum wages in the United States, let me reply in advance that that is a facile and superficial explanation of the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons are complex. One of the reasons is that the United States has a much more flexible labour market. It has a labour market and an industrial relations system that facilitates job growth in the small business sector. What happens in the United States is that as the economy begins to recover, that recovery is reflected in the generation of jobs. That is nowhere near the case in Australia, although I welcome the fact that there are apparently some signs that jobs are going to be generated a little more quickly in Australia than was originally thought. I wholeheartedly and unreservedly welcome any signs of any improvement on the employment front in this country. We have suffered from a rate of unemployment for too long. It is too high and has inflicted too much misery and pain on too many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to narrow the focus of my remarks to matters relating to debate about the green paper. I want in particular to refer to a document which was released yesterday and which was prepared by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Those people following politics in Australia will know that over the past couple of years the government of this country has been very happy to quote the Reserve Bank of Australia in aid of some of its economic arguments. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has criticised the taxation policies of the opposition. He did so on a number of occasions before the last election. The Governor of the Reserve Bank and other people in the Reserve Bank have spoken approvingly of the impact of certain government policies. I am not arguing about the right or otherwise of the Governor of the Reserve Bank to speak; I accept that he has a right as a statutory office-holder and a person charged with the management of the monetary policy of this country. He is a person who has a very good understanding of the functioning of the Australian economy and he has a total right to speak on any of these matters that he chooses to speak on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore interesting that, when the Reserve Bank of Australia produces a document about unemployment, it is very noteworthy that the government is completely silent in some of the things that the Reserve Bank has to say about unemployment&mdash;and well it may be silent. If we thumb through the document called `Towards full employment', which is a submission by the Reserve Bank of Australia to the government's task force on unemployment, we find a number of references that bear very heavily on the policy debate about unemployment which has gone on in this country over the last couple of years. In particular, the Reserve Bank is in no doubt that the rigidity of Australia's industrial relations system is a prime cause of unemployment. It is in no doubt about it at all. The Reserve Bank stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . changes in industrial relations arrangements which make it more difficult for the unemployed to offer their services at a realistic wage rate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank goes on to endorse the Austrain proposal in the spirit and, indeed, in the substance put forward by the opposition before the last election. The opposition said that, if a person is out of work for two years and is suffering from long-term unemployment, it is not unreasonable to ask of that person that he or she be re-employed initially at lower than the award rate, rising to the award rate after that person has been back in employment for the length of time that that person was out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank gives endorsement to that strategy. That strategy was put forward by the opposition before the last election. It was ridiculed by the government. Government members might say in parenthesis successfully. Yes, in electoral terms they were successful. They did manage to generate fear about some of those policies. They did manage to successfully ridicule them. Whether in the process they served the interests of the long-term unemployed and the interests of the Australian battlers, whom government members have always prattled on about being concerned for, is another matter. It is one of the signal features of the Australian political divide at present that the Labor Party that professes a lifelong compassion for low income earners in Australia perpetuates an industrial relations system that condemns more and more of them to the poverty of unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that particular subject, the Reserve Bank has also had quite a bit to say. It criticised the large rises in labour on-costs. It was careful not to criticise wages. I do not argue that Australian wages are high by world standards; they clearly are not. I have not argued that proposition for some years. But I do argue that many of the other rigidities&mdash;workers compensation and many of the other conditions that attach to the employment of people in this country&mdash;act as a disincentive to the employment of people. The Reserve Bank has basically said that the more minimum conditions the government imports into the industrial relations system, the harder, more expensive and more complicated it makes it for people to be employed. That is a fairly basic proposition. It is certainly a very basic proposition for the small business sector of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small business sector is the hope of the side in reducing unemployment. The government will not reduce unemployment in Australia through the BHPs and the CRAs&mdash;great companies though they may be. They are not the companies that are going to take on the large number of new employees to reduce unemployment over the next few years, unless there is a burst of employment activity on the part of the small business sector. That will not happen unless it is freed of many of the industrial relations constraints that it suffers at present. Instead of going in that direction, the government, right at the moment, in legislation now before this parliament, is going to make it worse. It is going to make it harder and more complicated to employ people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very interested to hear an interview with the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Kelty, a few days ago. I compliment the work that Mr Kelty and Mr Lindsay Fox have done in going around Australia and encouraging large companies to take on young people. I have no argument with that at all; I compliment both of them. I have spoken to both of them in the course of their travels around Australia in trying to persuade companies to take on young people. They have our total support and goodwill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kelty gave an example of visiting a hospital, I think it was, at Bairnsdale in Victoria. He made a very interesting comment that he had persuaded the hospital to knock off penalty rates and holiday loading and, as a result, it was going to employ six more people. That is what the Secretary of the ACTU said. Yet, in the election campaign, the opposition said that if the government had a more intelligent approach to penalty rates and holiday loading, it might generate a few more jobs in the service sector of the economy. Anybody who follows this knows that the service sector of the Australian economy is going to generate a lot of new jobs in the future. When we raised those matters a few months ago, it was typified as some kind of attack on the living standards of Australian workers. It was nothing of the kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view about penalty rates is very simple. They ought to be a matter of negotiation. They should not be a compulsory minimum standard. To the extent that they are, they are destroying jobs. I have Mr Kelty to support me in that proposition. If Bill Kelty can go to Bairnsdale and bargain for the creation of six jobs by getting the workers to give up their penalty rates and holiday loadings, why can that not happen elsewhere in Australia? Why does it need the personal fiat, warrant and approval of the Secretary of the ACTU? If it made economic sense for that hospital in Bairnsdale, does it not make economic sense for hospitals, firms and enterprises all around the country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) or somebody else with a background in the trade union movement who speaks&mdash;and I do not say that in any way derisively, but instructively in a debate like this&mdash;will say that it can happen only if the Secretary of the ACTU says so. That is what it all boils down to: if he is there and approves it, it is okay; but if he is not there and cannot give the idea a tick, it is not okay. That is not very satisfactory to many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the Reserve Bank report. On going through it, we find endorsements of the sorts of arguments that have been put forward by the coalition. For example, on page 17 of the Reserve Bank report, the following appears:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As important as the cyclical conjuncture is for unemployment outcomes, changes to demand and supply in the labour market can also be driven by forces which are not merely cyclical in nature. These changes might be the result of shifts in the pattern of skills required resulting, for example, from innovation in production, technologies or changing consumer tastes. The responsiveness of the labour market in the face of such changes is an important factor in determining employment and unemployment patterns, and the associated scope for non-inflationary economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank says later, on page 18:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labour market rigidities can amplify the effect on employment and unemployment of economic disturbances. They can also impede the movement of labour between jobs, industries, occupations or regions in response to changes in demand and supply conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to detail some important examples of where that occurs. Again and again one finds this report giving a very simple message: the more rigid, inflexible and regulated the labour market is, the more harmful is the effect on employment. The less regulated, rigid and ossified and the more flexible the labour market is, the more likely it is to have a beneficial effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That simple test is endorsed and ratified by the Reserve Bank. The Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, is frequently quoted with approval by the government on economic matters. If we apply that test to what the government is now doing in industrial relations we find an extremely disturbing pattern. Instead of the government going with what the Reserve Bank is putting out, the government is rowing in the opposite direction. It is making the labour market more rigid and, as a result, will condemn many thousands of Australians to longer periods of unemployment than would otherwise be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite within the wit and capacity of this country, even under the present government, to ensure that unemployment falls at a faster rate than it will over the next couple of years. It is quite within the wit and capacity of this nation to have an industrial relations system that provides adequate protection against exploitation, guarantees people a decent minimum wage, decent provisions for holidays, long service leave, sick leave and maternity leave and, beyond that, allows people to negotiate arrangements for the intervention of unions, if that is their wish, to get outcomes that are likely to create jobs and reward productive effort in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, that is not the path that has been chosen by this government. The government is pretending to reform industrial relations. The longer the debate goes on in the Senate, the more apparent it is that the bill, which passed through this place a few weeks ago, is nothing but an electoral payback to the ACTU. It certainly falls foul of the tests laid down by the Reserve Bank of Australia and does no credit to the claim of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) immediately after the election that he was going to be a reformer of industrial relations in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have two other comments to make. One relates to some remarks made in the Senate debate concerning the industrial relations bill. It does relate to the bill now before the parliament, which deals with matters touching on industrial relations. It was suggested during that Senate debate that, in some way, the Australian Democrats had been misled about some amendments concerning preference clauses which were being proposed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it perfectly clear that our aim at all times was to take out of the bill, and the principal act that it was amending, any capacity for the commission&mdash;or any other authority&mdash;to grant preference to unionists. Our view is very simple: whether someone is a unionist or non-unionist should be a matter of choice. We totally oppose victimisation of unionists and unions; and we totally oppose victimisation of non-unionists, people not desiring to join a union. We totally oppose&mdash;either in an award, act of parliament, certified agreement, enterprise flexibility agreement or any other industrial arrangement&mdash;preference being granted to a person or group of people because they belong to a union. That is a basic principle of non-discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It continues to amaze me that a government which daily gets out of its tree about issues of discrimination when it comes to sex, race, gender, religion or anything else, can turn a blind eye to discrimination in the workplace. It is all right apparently to say to somebody, `We will discriminate against you because you do not belong to a union and you vote Liberal'. But if we say, `We will discriminate against you because you are a man or because you are a woman', that is an entirely different matter. Both are objectionable. I cannot see why the former should not be as objectionable as the latter. That is probably a view that most Australians would agree with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that when the amendment to give partial effect to that was before the parliament, the government voted against it. It has now succumbed to the reality in the other place. But at no stage did we represent to the Democrats anything other than that we are totally opposed to the concept of preference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, to anticipate a later stage of this debate, I give notice that we will move an amendment to delete the entirety of part 7 of the bill, which deals with a number of aspects of superannuation law. If time permits, my learned colleague the shadow Attorney-General and honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) will speak on the objectionable features of part 7 of the bill. An amendment in my name is being circulated to honourable members. It will be moved at the appropriate time. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I probably mispronounce a few Sydney names, too. I appreciate the honourable member's lack of stridency in his contribution, because it is important to acknowledge&mdash;on the employment issue and the industrial relations system&mdash;that we are living in a changing world where one of the key factors that has been driving the change in policy that has occurred on both sides of this House has been the lessening in homogeneity of the production process. This has also occurred in many other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that has been compelling change&mdash;which people in the trade union movement have done a lot to come to terms with and work with&mdash;is the fact that we are no longer dealing with the relatively homogenous production processes that we dealt with in perhaps the 1940s and 1950s. Therefore, the large scale, comprehensive awards of the past may not be the appropriate vehicle of regulation they once were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean that we should move to the type of policy that the opposition advocates, but it does indicate that it is important to closely examine the change and the implications of that change. It is necessary to step back a bit from some of the self-righteousness that tends to dominate this debate&mdash;the suggestions that the government is voluntarily prolonging unemployment at a higher rate than it needs to or that there is some simple way that the government, by some magic legislative approach, can get rid of unemployment through changes to the industrial relations system. Those suggestions, which have been made by members of the opposition at various times, have no real place in the debate. I appreciate the fact that the honourable member for Bennelong has stepped away from that sort of approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before in this sort of debate, the unemployment rate in the United States is now at about 6 1/2 per cent. It is clearly lower than the Australian unemployment rate. Obviously there is a range of issues, as the honourable member for Bennelong conceded, that complicate the picture, that make a direct comparison between the two a little more complex than perhaps one would like to think. We have to take cognisance of the fact that people in the United States employed in certain industries which are exempt from the very low minimum wage of just under $5 an hour&mdash;people such as waiters and waitresses&mdash;are quite legally on rates below $3 an hour. We also have to take cognisance of the circumstances related to the employment situation in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we need not stop the analogy there. In addressing these issues, it is false to simply look at one country. The United Kingdom&mdash;probably as similar to Australia as is the United States; maybe more so&mdash;has a deregulated labour market and a persistently high unemployment rate. Its position is very similar to Australia's position. It is fair to conclude that the argument that there is some sort of magic connection between the industrial relations system and the level of unemployment in a country such as ours does not hold much substance. Obviously the connection between the two is a great deal more complex than we are led to believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before going to the substance of my comments today, I refer to a couple of other points made by the honourable member for Bennelong. I do not agree with him absolutely, but I think it is clear, as the caucus employment task force report indicated, that the issue of on-costs needs to be addressed, particularly with respect to occupational superannuation and workers compensation levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My personal view on that problem&mdash;it is not necessarily a view that is shared across the government benches or, indeed, in the trade union movement&mdash;is that we are now paying an extremely high price in this country for employment as a result of the Liberal opposition in the 1970s blocking the Whitlam government's national compensation and national superannuation schemes. I personally would support any moves that could be made towards those types of structures. I believe in the future we will start to move, possibly even pursued with the support of the conservative side of politics, towards those sorts of structures. We now have widespread occupational superannuation. It is being accepted by the bulk of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong raised the issue of penalty rates and negotiability. Through the mechanism of enterprise bargaining, negotiations are occurring every day at the workplace level on changes to penalty rate structures. It is now commonplace for these sorts of things to be tackled&mdash;without the intervention of the Secretary of the ACTU. It is not something unusual, strange or peculiar; it is happening as part of the normal industrial relations process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated before, the changes in the processes of production that have occurred, the massively increased diversity that now is the norm in our workplaces, are reasonable&mdash;provided we have some basic minimum standards and safeguards and protections that prevent exploitation to the greatest extent possible. No system will prevent all exploitation but, provided the vast bulk of potential exploitation is prevented, those changes are perfectly reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not forget some of the other connotations involved in this issue. For example, penalty rates used to act as a disincentive to a company having a worker work overtime instead of employing additional workers. This is an area that the trade union movement traditionally has had as a major goal&mdash;in fact, the limitation of overtime is written in the object clauses of many union rules. One of the reasons penalty rates for overtime should be supported is as a device to act as a disincentive to employers to get their workers to work 50 and 60 hours a week&mdash;because some will be prepared to do that&mdash;and therefore not put on extra employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the effective disincentive factor of penalty rates with respect to overtime has been eroded over time by the increasing imposts that have been placed on wages and salaries through things such as workers compensation levies and occupational superannuation through the award system. So I would not suggest it is necessarily a great thing to have a uniform hourly rate applying across whatever number of hours. In effect, that will act as an incentive to an employer to employ a person for a longer period of time, for more hours, and not consider the option of putting on another person. We are dealing with a complex picture. We are dealing with things that are all interrelated. Often some of these things will have consequences which we would not necessarily automatically expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the jobs levy, to which the honourable member for Bennelong referred in his speech. Essentially, I support the notion of a jobs levy, but I do not give any blanket support to the idea. We have to examine various tax options and consider an approach that will be credible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Time will tell. The honourable member's information may be better than mine, I do not know. The basic problem is structural. I think it is now clearly recognised&mdash;not by everybody but I think by many people&mdash;that growth by itself will not be enough. It has been estimated by people such as Professor Gregory that we will need growth of roughly six per cent per annum between now and the year 2000 in order to effectively eradicate the unemployment problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a fairly wide recognition of the phenomenon of jobless growth, which is a phenomenon affecting not only Australia but the bulk of the OECD. A change in production processes&mdash;related to the types of skills that are in demand, the work that is being performed by people and what is needed in the economy&mdash;is sweeping the Westernised countries. It is connected to changing technology, changing work practices and production processes and the shift to manufacturing in the Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an enormous drop in demand for the unskilled and the low skilled, particularly in the blue-collar arena but also heading into the office based white-collar arena. That has placed downward market pressure on wage rates for people in the traditionally low-paid occupational groups. Like any aspect of the labour market, it is not instantly amenable to a very simplistic supply and demand analysis. Although market factors will obviously influence how this particular market behaves, it is not that simple. It is not the Victoria Market with people selling sacks of potatoes. It is a lot more complex than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be recognised by this House that lowering the price for low-skilled labour will not generate more demand for low-skilled work. What applies in other markets where there is a degree of elasticity does not apply in this situation. So, if there is a current demand for 100,000 labourers of a particular description, just because their wage rates are suddenly lowered does not mean that, as a result, there will be additional work of that character to be performed in the economy and that therefore more people who have those skills are capable of being employed. We have a structural problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative to the strategy of lowering wages to stimulate increased demand, which I would suggest would not occur, is to reduce supply. That is basically the thrust of the government strategy. Through its labour market programs and through the massive increase in funding that has occurred to education in this nation in the past eight to 10 years, the government is endeavouring to reduce the number of people in the work force or seeking employment who have very limited skills to offer. I support that strategy wholeheartedly. That is what a jobs levy and the proceeds from such a levy need to be directed towards. We need to enhance, strengthen and further pursue that sort of strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There could be substantial costs in resolving unemployment because of the entrenched structural problem, but those costs will have to be met. There is a simplistic notion that the costs should be met by slugging the rich; but that will not work because, while rich people might have a lot of money, there are not all that many of them. Any serious assault on unemployment will have to be contributed to by the majority of people currently employed. That can be achieved in one of two ways: by the opposition's strategy&mdash;if it worked, which I do not accept&mdash;of lowering wages, at least for some, and notionally redistributing those wages to the unemployed, supposedly by providing them with jobs; or through the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic difficulty with the opposition's strategy&mdash;this illustrates the different values and constituencies that the two parties represent&mdash;is that, even if it did work, the people who would bear the cost of providing employment for those long-term unemployed people, who are now heading towards the 400,000 plus mark, would be those who can least afford to pay and those who are already most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. The most comfortable, those with the greatest capacity to pay, would bear no or little cost. The opposition's strategy would have no impact on honourable members&mdash;we are all on $68,000 a year, plus various bits and pieces. Allowing wages to fall by deregulation would have no impact at all on us. Yet through the tax system, through a jobs levy or some other mechanism, we would contribute, as would other high income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are serious about being egalitarian in this country&mdash;a philosophy on which the Labor Party does not have a monopoly&mdash;we have to look at how this would be paid for. As an illustration of where Western society is heading economically and structurally, I commend <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Work of Nations </EMPHASIS>by Robert Reich, the Secretary for Labour in the Clinton Administration. It illustrates the dramatic changes that have occurred in the structure of Western economies and the particular implications that those changes hold for lower skilled workers. The theme that stands out in that book&mdash;which this government has picked up on when comparing our performance and the performance of the United Kingdom&mdash;is the need to educate and train the work force. In a global economy, Australian workers at all levels will be better off and better positioned with training and the ability to get experience even, if necessary, in subsidised jobs. That is why we need something in the form of a jobs levy to fund additional assaults above and beyond those already mounted on the long-term unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is yet to be seen what the actual task force on unemployment report will come out with&mdash;we will find that out tomorrow. There will obviously be debate over a number of months on alternative ways of reducing the level of unemployment. The report may come out with several alternatives of its own. I urge opposition members to think laterally and to go beyond the simplistic notion that minimum wages&mdash;set at very basic levels&mdash;cause unemployment to rise. That is an unsustainable proposition that opposition members repeat with such evangelical fervour that it indicates a lack of evidence to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the miscellaneous items of legislation that we are dealing with in this debate relate to matters that in the current jargon come under the heading of `political correctness'. For example, in the Defence Act 1903, we are replacing the word `chairman' with the word `president', which I wholeheartedly support. This sort of thing is regularly lampooned by people on the conservative side of politics, in the media and the like. There are occasional examples where this sort of thing goes a bit too far&mdash;I cannot come to terms with the idea of calling the honourable member for Bennelong `vertically challenged'. In fact, I think the most appropriate thing to do is to make no reference at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though there are things that are easy to lampoon, language reflects values. It sends messages, especially to children, about our society: how we see ourselves, who is and is not important, and how we should behave. Hence, all of us would agree that racially charged words, such as `nigger'&mdash;commendably, the Queensland Government is taking steps to replace such language where it appears in certain place names&mdash;reflect a past society and past values which are no longer appropriate in contemporary Australia and are suitable for removal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some call this social engineering. We socially engineer all the time&mdash;we engineer our children in the way that we bring them up both within individual families and on a broader social level. Collective decisions to change how that occurs do not mean that we have not previously been socially engineering them. It means that we have decided that certain things that used to be acceptable are now unacceptable because of changing community values and therefore should not be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, opposition members cannot resist the temptation to take things out of context and to blow them up into something that they clearly are not. A classic example of this occurred recently with the unfortunate comments by Senator McGauran on the child-care guidelines. After his very commendable comments on East Timor&mdash;I commend his views to other opposition members and suggest they have a chat with him&mdash;I was disappointed to hear his comments on the child-care guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reading the guidelines, one realises that he made absolutely nonsensical accusations. He suggested that Christmas carols are being banned. The guidelines only suggest that it is not necessarily appropriate to have Christmas carols played non-stop for a month before Christmas and that it may be a good idea to intersperse a few other bits of music&mdash;hardly a revolutionary concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McGauran also suggested that words such as `no' and `naughty' had been banned. This was an ironic suggestion, considering the basic standpoint of the opposition. In those guidelines, the government was saying to child-care centres that they should not usurp the role of the parent. Of course, if one child is hitting another, it is all right to say, `No, naughty', or whatever. But where, for example, a child is exhibiting some behaviour that does not threaten anybody, it is essentially the preserve of the parents whether to chastise or not, or to determine a strategy of how to deal with it. It is not the role of the child-care worker to say, `No, naughty', and to chastise&mdash;something that I would have thought the opposition, given its professed concern for the role of parents and so on, would have actually supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So these things have been portrayed in quite a bizarre way. There is a considerable need for us to gradually progress the use of language to reflect contemporary values, not the values of the past and not the days when society had totally hierarchical, patriarchal structures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We just heard a rambling expose which covered a number of topics, went around the stage and came back again. I am not really sure what the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) told us except that he did so in very measured terms and seemed to say, `There are a few minor problems in the world but, basically, in Australia things are pretty all right. We might consider a jobs levy, a little bit of money here and a little bit of money there. It is perfectly all right to change all of our language and a few other things. The opposition is simplistic'&mdash;I picked that one up&mdash;`but, essentially, we don't have many problems'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are here today to debate what is supposed to be an industrial relations bill&mdash;the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill&mdash;but which is in fact a collection of bits and pieces which ought to have been part of legislation dealt with at earlier times by this House. In effect, we are dealing with a rubbish bill&mdash;it is a bill of rubbish. It parallels the Industrial Relations Reform Bill which dealt with voluminous rubbish. Every day, as the detail of that bill unfolds in the Senate, line by line, item by item, outside the House the government is queried on its real intent with respect to the words it put in that massive document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the problems created by its volume and its complexity&mdash;difficulties arise in trying to understand it, let alone read it&mdash;will not be dealt with in any comprehensive way for the next decade. We have some very real problems in Australia and this bill does not deal with any of those problems. Our problems start with debt. We owe the rest of the world $178.8 billion net. That is a lot of money. We do not have the money to pay it back. We are not generating income in excess of what we spend to cover the debt. So we have to borrow money to pay the interest bill. As we borrow the money to pay the interest bill, the value of our dollar continues to be suspect&mdash;it is probably lower than it might otherwise be. That may help our exports a bit, but that overprices imports, which overwhelm the exports, and we wind up with imports costing more than they ought to. Structurally, inflation, while it is low, is higher than it might be if we had a balanced economy, but the fact is that we owe too much to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next big problem we have is unemployment. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) spoke about the Reserve Bank's statement which attempts to deal with this issue of unemployment and the Labor Party's continuous infatuation with programs to try to deal with things such as unemployment. Just about everyone in Australia who has any real knowledge of these things agrees that a jobs levy would be nothing more than a straight out tax on working Australians. We do not have enough working Australians at present. Our goods are not competitive enough or their quality is not high enough yet. We have not yet sourced out or found the markets overseas to encourage our people to export more and replace some of the goods that we import. We are not even very good at encouraging government to buy Australian made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a massive unemployment problem. We can talk about it in measured terms and those on the government benches can try to explain how they are going to deal with this problem, but the fact is that ALP governments created the problems we have. As long as they are in government, we will have to live with them. Australians may as well wake up and recognise that fact because it is not going to go away. While those opposite are in government, unemployment will be high because they do not know how to deal with it. They do not know how to encourage industry to invest in a capacity to build real jobs in the real economy. They do not have a clue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another one of our real problems is skills training. We do not have enough discrete skills training. Just about everybody in the education and training market in Australia agrees that we need to make some shifts in that area. That does not mean that in some draconian manner we tell those who need a broad based university education that they cannot have it. What we do is tell those who do not believe that they need a broad based university education that we can help them to obtain the skills that they will find necessary in the real job market today. As the honourable member for Melbourne said, that job market is changing&mdash;that is demonstrably so&mdash;and there are fewer and fewer unskilled jobs every day of every week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major problem is that we do not have enough national savings. We are living on debt and on Bankcard&mdash;on borrowed money. This point has been made many times. If our households operated in the same way as our national accounts, we would have very few households that could afford to go to the movies, could afford to go out to dinner or could afford to put petrol in their cars. We have borrowed money to live beyond our means. Sooner or later we are going to have to slow down and pay the piper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investment in new productive capacity is another problem that this nation has. Our investment is too low. There is a whole range of structural problems why that is so, not the least of which is this issue of industrial relations. Those companies which would invest in new plant and equipment would like to know that there is in place an environment where they can work in a modern manner with their employees to achieve results that are needed in order to be able to grow and to provide products, goods or services that society wants to purchase and is willing to pay for. Investment in new productive capacity is a problem and we will not address it until we address the industrial relations problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have government regulation and overregulation. In the ten years from 1983 to 1992 that the Hawke Labor government and now the Keating Labor government has been in this place, this House has passed 40,279 pages of legislation, statutes and acts. That is a ripper&mdash;and a record as well. At 4,028 pages a year, that is twice the rate of the Fraser government in the seven years preceding it and several times the rate of the Menzies government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is all about producing paper in the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill which we are debating nominally today. It is just more paper about issues such as changing gender title. I do not mind whether we call the head of a commission the president rather than the chairman, but until somebody pointed it out to me I never really considered that the title chairman had a gender base. I just thought it was the title of someone who headed a committee, whether male or female. Almost everybody else in the community felt the same. But we have now devoted pages of new legislation which will add to the record that this government has in overregulation. There are more pages of legislation devoted to changing titles from chairman to president. That will generate more volumes of paper. The regulations that back up this legislation amount to tens of thousands of pages. I do not know where we are headed, but this place is certainly keeping the paper industry going, if nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another real problem that we have in this nation is our highly cosseted labour market. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill that we debated earlier, which will be brought back to this House no doubt later this week, adds another 193 pages of complex legislation which, as it has unfolded in the Senate, is unworkable and a huge nonsense. My view is that this bill contains the seeds of destruction of the entire industrial relations system in this country&mdash;the mechanisms for setting wages and conditions of employment. The government&mdash;the ALP, the Labor Party, the mates of the trade union movement&mdash;has now so overbalanced the equation and given so much power to the trade unions by putting in place so many bureaucratic rules and regulations which are so complex and need to be dealt with by the legal society that it is bound to fail. Cartels always fail. There is no cartel in the history of the world that has ever survived for very long. This cartel between the ACTU, the Labor government and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which is now enshrined in another 193 pages of legislation, is doomed to failure. It has itself sown the seeds and the government will reap the results. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, this system will allow a cooperative arrangement between the registries at the state and federal levels to ensure that we go ahead into the world of enterprise bargaining based upon the award system&mdash;the award system which is so essential to ensuring that we have in this country a fair and balanced system of industrial relations which protects the rights of those who do not have any bargaining power if the award system were not to exist. It is to those ends that I wish to direct my remarks today. In particular, I want to talk about the government's approach which is summed up in this amendment and contrast it with the approach of the opposition, which approach we heard about in the previous industrial relations bill and which we have again heard today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor is seeking a cooperative system of industrial relations based upon the platform of the award system&mdash;a system which is based on the central role of the Industrial Relations Commission and all of the administrative backup which it requires. Essentially, that is Labor's consensual approach to industrial relations&mdash;an approach which is rejected by the opposition. It is this consensual approach which is bringing many lasting benefits to this economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1980s this consensual approach resulted in the creation of 1.6 million jobs. Labor holds many records in this country. We created an unprecedented number of jobs in the 1980s&mdash;something which is never acknowledged by those opposite, particularly when they discuss the problems of unemployment as they exist today. During the 1980s we created 1.6 million jobs. One of the reasons we created that record number of jobs was that we had in place effectively a wages policy which produced a curtailment in real wages over that time and led to the creation of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We created jobs in a fair and balanced way. We did it in a way that this opposition never acknowledges. Opposition members never come into this House and acknowledge the sacrifice that was made by the work force of this country throughout the 1980s. Those opposite never acknowledge it because they want more: they want to cut wages so that they are even lower. They always want to force down wages and they want to cut public spending. I do not know how cutting public spending and slashing wages in the current environment will do anything to create jobs. Nothing that the opposition has said in this debate or previous debates can demonstrate how that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a gradualist approach to industrial relations. We have the support of the great bulk of the business community for doing so, and we certainly have the support of the Australian electorate. The opposition does not have the support of the electorate or the business community for its big bang approach to industrial relations&mdash;the big bang approach to industrial relations which was delivered by Jeff Kennett in Victoria, which is currently being delivered in Western Australia and which is still the policy advocated by the opposition in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote&mdash;as indeed I did during the industrial relations debate&mdash;the Chief Executive of BHP, Mr John Prescott. He dismissed the need for bigger changes in industrial relations. On 4 November, Mr Prescott warned that changing to a totally different system of industrial relations could cause `a great deal of disruption'. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . industrial law should not get too far ahead of actual development. The parties on the ground can do a lot more with the existing legislation than they've done.</PARA>
<PARA>That does not support any of the contentions put forward by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) or the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) in this debate today. We have had a system throughout the 1980s which has produced the flexibility that we require as we become a more export oriented trading nation. We have produced a system which has become much more flexible, but it has not delivered the absolute cuts in real wages sought by the opposition. So those opposite come into this House and denigrate the system. But they cannot denigrate it to many of the practitioners on the ground who have received the benefits of that increased flexibility throughout the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case for gradualism, I suggest, is compelling. It is significant that the case for the big bang approach put forward by the opposition has been rejected by the people. The head of BHP has rejected it. The opposition's contention that some dramatic cut in real wages will produce tremendous employment gains is not supported by any of the evidence which is being produced by prominent labour market economists. Neither is it supported by much of the evidence or much of the experience from the United States that is cited by opposition members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Bob Gregory is currently a member of the Prime Minister's expert panel which is producing the green paper and subsequently the white paper. Professor Gregory also argues the case for gradualism and rejects the case put forward by the opposition. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the labour market is the key market in which the greatest differences have emerged among OECD countries over the last two decades.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australia may well be at a watershed of labour market reform, and the nature of this reform may be the crucial and irreversible policy choice over the next two years.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . recent labour market experiences in Australia, New Zealand and most of OECD Europe seem to suggest that the effects of adverse labour market shocks are not easily reversed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to think carefully before adopting policies of radical change&mdash;there are dangers associated with a rapid and too radical deregulation of the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA>Essentially, Professor Gregory is rejecting the approach put forward by the opposition. What evidence does Professor Gregory offer? He offers a great deal of evidence. He says that US experience suggests caution before accepting some of the more optimistic forecasts of the benefits that will flow from radical deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that article, Professor Gregory goes on to cite the employment experience of casual female workers in Australia and the United States to back up his contentions. It is a fact that the most dramatic increases in real wages in this country have occurred amongst the casual female work force in recent times. The most dramatic employment gains in this country have been in that area of the work force. How can the opposition come into this House and mount a case that the sole and complete cause of unemployment is the level of real wages when the greatest employment gains made in our community have been made by the workers who have secured, over time, the greatest increase in real wages?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system, the whole problem, is much more complex than that, as the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) said earlier. But the opposition refuses to acknowledge the complexity of the issue. The reality is that the current levels of unemployment are not just a product of our current recession but a product of the fundamental structural changes taking place within our economy. For example, more fundamental structural changes have meant that, of the 1.6 million jobs created in this country during the 1980s, only one in seven of those went to a person who was previously unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to secure very high levels of economic growth right through to the year 2000, very large numbers of people&mdash;400,000 or 500,000&mdash;would still be defined as being long-term unemployed. That is the case for substantial government intervention via labour market programs to do something for those people. Those programs will not automatically create jobs out of nothing. We on this side of the House acknowledge that government cannot do that. We acknowledge that the most fundamental way to reduce unemployment is to secure growth in the private sector. We have put in place a whole host of policies to do that, in particular the lowering of the corporate rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But 400,000 people out there will not be the beneficiaries of that. They have been sidelined, due to their long-term unemployment, defined as being almost unemployable. The employers that the honourable member for Bennelong talks about will not consider those people unless there is positive labour market intervention. We need positive labour market interventions for these people to rescue them from the fate delivered to them by fundamental structural change in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the opposition to come into this House and claim, on the one hand, that labour market programs are useless and then somehow claim, on the other hand, that it stands for some degree of egalitarianism in the community is simply preposterous. Those who stand for egalitarianism should stand for very substantial interventions to do something about the long-term unemployed. The most fundamental redistribution of wealth which occurs in this community occurs via unemployment. Failure to act for the long-term unemployed will skew the distribution of wealth in this community from the bottom to the top much more fundamentally than any other form of tax measure that the opposition might care to put forward. We are a party which cares about equity. Those who care about equity have to care about the distribution of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Melbourne said before, every policy put forward by the opposition will redistribute wealth from people who are unemployed or who are on low wages to people who are on high wages. That is the policy of the opposition, either via its expenditure cuts of $10 billion put forward in Fightback&mdash;the abolition of the CES, the abolition of labour market programs and so on&mdash;or via the tax system. This is why those opposite simply cry foul whenever we want to have a logical discussion about how we might raise the revenue to provide for the 400,000 or 500,000 people who are victims of fundamental structural change in our economy and who will remain victims unless we do something for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is not scared of the debate about the green paper and the white paper. We will have that debate over the months ahead and the poverty of the opposition's approach will be exposed during that time. I think the poverty of its approach was best summed up in a recent interview given by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program with Kerry O'Brien. I would like to quote from the transcript of that program. Kerry O'Brien asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . So where is John Hewson on the political spectrum, today, compared to the past?</PARA>
<PARA>The transcript continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOHN HEWSON: Well, Kerry, I don't ever allocate myself to the political spectrum. I leave that for people like you and others to do. John Hewson's still committed to the basic sense and direction of the policies we took to the last election although, clearly, some of the detail will change, and to be clear, we've set the GST tax package aside.</PARA>
<PARA>But the broad approach is pretty much the same in terms of the principles. That means that the opposition remains fundamentally committed to Fightback. It remains committed to dramatic and drastic cuts in public expenditure. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), came into this House and advocated taxation levels equivalent to that of most of our Asian trading partners, which would mean a cut in public expenditure in this country of between $10 billion and $20 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition continues to decline to name which programs it would hack into. But, because it is still committed to the principles of Fightback, we know which ones they would be. The CES would go, labour market programs would go and the family income supplement would go. All of those things would have to go because if those opposite are going to cut public expenditure by $10 billion to $20 billion they will have to pick the big ticket items&mdash;$5 billion on family allowance and family income supplements, $8 billion on pensions and $1.3 billion on labour market programs. If those opposite want public expenditure cuts to the tune of $10 billion to $20 billion and they are still sticking to the principles of Fightback they cannot be concerned about jobs and equity. I will quote a bit more from the interview with Kerry O'Brien on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>. Speaking to the Leader of the Opposition, Kerry O'Brien said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You weren't always so coy about this spectrum question. In 1986, you told writer, Craig McGregor: `I'm clearly on the right of the Liberal Party; I'm a pragmatic dry. I like competition. There's nothing like putting your&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>part of his anatomy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on the line'. Now is it&mdash;that's basically the same, you haven't changed?</PARA>
<PARA>The transcript continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOHN HEWSON: That was before I entered Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">KERRY O'BRIEN: But you haven't changed philosophically?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOHN HEWSON: No. The basic direction's the same although I think, having reflected on it, words like right and dry don't mean all that much now.</PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. The fact is that the opposition is committed to Fightback. It will somehow cover up the fact that it does not have a GST, but it is still committed to cutting public expenditure by between $10 billion and $20 billion. It is still committed to all of those principles which can only cause unemployment in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do those opposite come into the House and carry on with this pretence&mdash;day in, day out&mdash;that they have some solution to the problem of unemployment? We do not pretend to have all of the answers on this side of the House, which is why we have engaged in the white paper process. We have engaged in fiscal stimulus to the maximum extent possible, and that is creating jobs in the community. But what does the opposition say? It says, `Oh, we shouldn't be doing that. We shouldn't be having a deficit of the level that we have got. We'll cut that. Well, that's more unemployment. We'll cut the labour market programs and we'll cut the CES'. The fact is that in this area the opposition is talking essentially about what it stands for in Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> interview because it really goes to the heart of the opposition's dilemma. Kerry O'Brien said to the Leader of the Opposition:</PARA>

<PARA>The transcript continued:</PARA>

I offered her a very good portfolio last time in a combination of administrative services and privatisation designed specifically, I thought, to give her maximum scope to pursue her interests and for her talents to emerge.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition went on:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in support of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) to delete part 7 of the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill dealing with the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. This part is but briefly described in its positive sense in the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). It is described in terms that suggest it is quite innocuous. In his second reading speech the minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 will assist Comcare and licensed authorities to recover certain overpayments which may occur when an employee who is receiving workers compensation benefits retires and becomes entitled to superannuation benefits. The proposed amendment introduces a scheme that will enable the overpayment to be recovered from the superannuation fund concerned, rather than from the individual.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us see how this little scheme is intended to work. The provisions contemplate that Comcare, or an authority licensed under the act&mdash;meaning in this case Australia Post or Telecom Australia&mdash;is paying an employee of the Commonwealth, or of a Commonwealth instrumentality, workers compensation benefits under the act and the employee then retires. If Comcare or its licensed authority forms the opinion that it may make, or may have made, an overpayment of compensation to the retired employee, it may then give a notice to the administrator of a superannuation scheme under which the employee is entitled to a pension, to a lump sum, or to both. I repeat the condition to which the power to give the notice relates. Comcare, or the licensed authority, forms the opinion that it may make, or may have made, an overpayment of compensation to the employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now have a look at the notice. The notice may state, as conditions of power, that Comcare may make, or may have made, an overpayment. It may then require the superannuation scheme administrator to tell Comcare or the authority whether the retired employee has received any payment of lump sum or pension, or whether the employee's benefits have been deferred. The notice may then require the administrator, if the retired employee has not received any superannuation benefits and the benefits have not been deferred, not to pay any superannuation, either lump sum or pension. The notice may also require the administrator as soon as practicable to give Comcare or the authority particulars of the benefits that are payable to the retired employee under the superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a situation in which an authority&mdash;an insurance authority, in effect, alien to the superannuation fund&mdash;is entitled, on the formation of an opinion that an event may have occurred or may occur in the future, to freeze the superannuation benefits. Comcare or the authority is required then to give the employee a written notice stating that it has given a notice to the administrator and explaining how the provisions work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Comcare or the authority receives the details from the administrator, Comcare or the authority is obliged within two working days of receipt to determine whether an overpayment has occurred. Let me say that again, but in another way. Comcare, or the licensed authority, is not obliged to determine whether an overpayment has actually occurred until it has received details from the superannuation scheme administrator of the benefits payable to the retired employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comcare or the authority must, within the same two-day period, either advise the administrator that no overpayment has occurred or state the amount of the overpayment and then require the administrator to pay that amount to Comcare or the licensed authority. The administrator is then required to pay the amount of the overpayment of compensation to Comcare or the licensed authority out of the pension or the lump sum payments which the administrator would otherwise have paid to the employee. That payment discharges any obligation of the administrator to the retired employee in respect of the amount of the payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an extraordinary scheme. The power to assault the employee's superannuation arrangements arises before a determination has even been made as to whether there has been an overpayment. It is irrelevant to whether or not Comcare or the licensed authority has power to freeze the benefits. If there have been overpayments, it is irrelevant that they may have been due to the negligence of Comcare or the licensed authority, or even that they have been done deliberately. It is irrelevant that the retired employee may challenge the determination or the anticipated determination by Comcare and might wish to argue that there is no overpayment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retired employee is the silent victim of a bureaucratic monstrous scheme. Many employees spend years planning their retirement. Many make detailed plans for paying off mortgages, going on trips, investing for the future, or making gifts to their children, and it may make an enormous difference to their plans whether they receive their lump sum in full or they receive their pension payments on time. For many, those plans are quite capable of being disrupted by this scheme. What makes it worse is that there is no encouragement to Comcare or the licensed authority to get the determinations right, or to get those determinations done in a timely way. There is positive encouragement to Comcare and the licensed authority to let the payments run on, knowing that they can recover them from the retired employee at will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one examines the principle that might be stated as the basic operating mechanism of this scheme, it would seem to be this: Comcare, as a workers compensation insurer of Commonwealth employees, is entitled to make overpayments negligently, deliberately or inadvertently to an employee and then to recover the overpayments by whatever means it decides in relation to the employee's superannuation payments. It is patronising in the extreme. The employee is not given the choice of saying, `I would like to pay that out of this nest egg account that my wife has'. He is not entitled to say, `I will borrow it from my children to repay this overpayment'. He is not even entitled to say before the scheme freezes his superannuation benefits that he has not been overpaid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can think of how this scheme might be extended if one Commonwealth authority is entitled to say to another Commonwealth authority, `A Commonwealth employee or a former Commonwealth employee owes me money. Why not just institute some sort of EFTPOS scheme onto salary?' That is basically what this is. It is EFTPOS into the superannuation payments, lump sum or pension that can be implemented at the will of Comcare or a licensed authority without reference to the employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a most extraordinary piece of legislation to be proposed by a government that purports to represent the working man. It is totally objectionable and, in my humble view, it is outrageous. I cannot understand how the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) could have offered a certificate that this does not infringe the privacy of an employee. I cannot understand how a government that seeks to represent the working man could be proposing it. I cannot understand how it ever got through caucus. I cannot understand how it ever got through cabinet. But I can understand why it was proposed by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is part of a package that is tied up with string and which will cost working people of Australia jobs. But it will cost them not only jobs; if this part of the scheme gets implemented it will also cost them their superannuation benefits under arrangements that they may have had in place for many years.

I think that as legislators we have an obligation to make it easy for people to understand the proceedings of parliament.

It has been said that the essential nature of the amendments before the House is to allow the Commonwealth industrial relations registry to act as a registry of a state industrial tribunal where the states and the Commonwealth agree to this; to clarify the operation of the maternity leave provisions for the parliamentary departments; to extend the operation of the act and regulations dealing with occupational health and safety of Commonwealth employees to others at or near the workplace; and to allow Comcare to recover overpayments from the superannuation entitlements of former employees where they have received an overpayment.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Six of these amendments result from careless or faulty drafting of instructions submitted by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) to the parliamentary draftsmen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills are being rushed through the parliament in a great hurry. Those who listen to the parliamentary broadcasts, and those in this place, would know that more and more we find that the debate is limited; we find that the guillotine is being applied and that we are not having reasonable time for debate, with the result that the quality of the legislation passing through this House is not really what it should be. The net result is that the minister has to come back into the parliament and ask the House to, in effect, fix up what should have been fixed up in the first place. I think that that is very sad and it is a very great reflection on the government. It is a very strong argument for having an upper house, a house of review. But even our house of review does not always make sure that the legislation is what it indeed ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is not opposing this bill. However, we are concerned about a number of the matters it raises. One thing I am very worried about is the social engineering aspect of the bill in changing the term chairman to president. Of itself, that change is fairly unobjectionable&mdash;both chairman and president are respected words&mdash;but the suggestion is that the word chairman is a sexist term and that somehow the word president is non-gender specific. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford English Dictionary</EMPHASIS>, volume 2 of the 1989 edition, the word chairman is defined as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.a. The occupier of a chair of authority;&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>such as yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the person who is chosen to preside over a meeting, to conduct its proceedings, and who occupies the chair or seat provided for this function.</PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing there about the gender of the occupant. The person who occupies the chair simply becomes the chairman. I think that some of the politically correct language changes being made at the moment are all a bit precious. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) said that, while he supported these changes, even he was concerned about the extent of some changes in this social engineering area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fairly sad that politically correct language and behaviour is now creeping into our bills as well as into child-care centres. What will the end result be? Honourable members would be aware of the politically correct guidelines for child-care centres that the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, issued recently. My electorate office has been inundated with complaints from people on the Sunshine Coast and throughout the electorate of Fisher who very strongly object to the abolition of Christmas in child-care centres.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They will stop at nothing, as the honourable member for Bennelong says. Is the fact that Santa Claus is not depicted as a gender neutral figure the reason the government seeks to ban Christmas celebrations from child-care centres? I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as someone I consider to be a reasonable individual: will Australian toddlers who fail to remove gender specific titles from their vocabulary find that funding to their child-care centres is cut? It is tragic that the government, in its fifth term, is now implementing its philosophy in this way. People, regardless of their politics&mdash;be they Labor, Liberal or National party&mdash;would be totally opposed to what the government is seeking to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the government will review the guidelines. If it has any commonsense, and an eye to the next election result, it must take on board the outrage of people in all sections of the community over this attempt at social engineering to produce a generation of politically correct young Australians. The attitude of this government is very similar to that of the discredited former communist regimes in eastern Europe which were prepared to influence the minds of young people as they went through the education system. I therefore hope that the government reconsiders this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) referred to part 7 of the bill, which relates to the amendments to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. That change introduces a number of new sections dealing with the recovery of overpayments to employees who retire at a time when they are in receipt of Comcare benefits. These are shocking provisions. As indicated by my colleague, it would allow Comcare, without reference to its clients, to recover overpayments from their superannuation funds. That really amounts to a grab, which is quite despicable. Indeed, I am totally opposed to what the government is seeking to achieve here. It is outrageous that the government is seeking to bring a legal provision into the legislation which will allow any person or body access to any individual's superannuation fund. However, the section that I find to be of particular concern is the one dealing with the Industrial Relations Act. As the honourable member for Bennelong said, I am always happy to talk about the industrial relations situation in this country because, quite frankly, it is a total and unmitigated disaster. Members on both sides of the House, during the limited time that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) allowed us, debated the industrial relations legislation a week or two ago. Unfortunately, that bill did not meet Australia's real needs in this area. We did not find any increased flexibility. We did not find any genuine move towards enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I looked at the title of this legislation, I thought that perhaps the minister had had a change of approach; perhaps he realised the inadequacy of his sell-out to the unions with the legislation we debated such a short time ago. When I read the pages of the bill and saw that it was an omnibus bill&mdash;a grab bag of bits and pieces, as one of my colleagues referred to it a little while ago&mdash;I realised that it was totally inadequate. It did not seek to remedy any of the real changes necessary in the industrial relations area; it did not address the question of unemployment. At the moment, we have one million people out of work&mdash;and perhaps as many as two million people who are unable to find enough work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tomorrow the government will be releasing its green paper on unemployment. There is already a suggestion that there will be a jobs levy&mdash;to which the people of my electorate of Fisher are totally opposed. This bill does not meet any of the real needs in the industrial relations area. It does nothing to solve the unemployment crisis. It does nothing to remove the labour market rigidities and regulations. Indeed, it is a major disaster. We still have an unemployment rate of more than 11 per cent. Something needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To sum up&mdash;my abbreviated time is almost up&mdash;this bill fails on all counts: it seeks to socially engineer; it seeks to change a large number of acts with one piece of legislation; it brings in an absolutely dreadful and despicable amendment that would grant Comcare access to superannuation funds; it fails to make very necessary amendments in industrial relations. This government stands totally and completely condemned by its absolute abrogation of its responsibility to the people of Australia. This government stands condemned and will continue to be condemned by Australians throughout the nation for its absolute failure to properly govern and adopt policies needed by a nation with so many troubles. </PARA>

I would like to make a few observations about the industrial relations matters presently under the consideration of this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the honour to be part of an Australian delegation to the Indian subcontinent: India, with a population of nearly 900 million people; Bangladesh, with a population of 120 million people; and, Nepal, with a population of 20 million people. In the course of that parliamentary delegation it was very interesting and revealing to hear the various prime ministers and finance ministers talking about open, competitive economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those nations&mdash;where the standards of living do not rate, and where they are struggling to feed their populations&mdash;governments are moving in the opposite direction to this government when it comes to deregulation, freeing up their economies and freeing up the labour market. Whilst the condition of the labour market in those nations is dramatically different to that found in Australia, their attitude was one of creating a privatisation program to make domestic industries more competitive and to open up investment so that jobs would be created. As reported in the New York <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald Tribune</EMPHASIS>, Europe has a similar problem with between 14 million and 16 million people unemployed. That situation is due in part to inflexible labour market arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That paper, and a number of commentators in that paper, drew to my attention the relationship between the industrial relations arrangements in Europe and in the United Kingdom and the lack of jobs. The unemployment rate was between 10 and 12 per cent. That compares to the situation in the United States, which the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) alluded to earlier in the debate. He said that the rate of unemployment in that country is in the range of 6 1/2 per cent of the work force. That is the situation as the United States comes out of a recession. A more flexible labour market allows that country to create more jobs, especially in that small business sector. The more competitive, less rigid system in America allows jobs to be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the comparison to Asian nations paints an enviable picture. Asian nations are becoming competitive; they are creating wealth and investment. They are using those very big populations to create job opportunities with more flexible job arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These industrial relations bills&mdash;both the one before the House now and the key industrial relations bill relating to the formation of enterprise agreements before the Senate&mdash;are really industrial relations bills in name only. As I said recently in the parliament, there were 12 hurdles to the formation of these enterprise agreements. The attitude of the government has been that enterprise agreements will be covered under these new arrangements. Obviously, when one looks at the fine print, there can be nothing further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to quote what Professor Judith Sloan, who is well known to members of this House, said in relation to industrial relations. She is highly respected. She makes some independent observations about the industrial relations system, both historically and in a future context. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of October 14 an article entitled `The Brereton can of worms' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The labour market reform package is a sham, writes Judith Sloan</PARA>
<PARA>In the thrust of her article, which we have to take some recognition of because of her deep understanding of industrial relations in Australia, she goes on to say&mdash;and she agrees with my proposition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the hurdles being imposed by the legislation, it will be a brave non-unionised (and probably foolish) employer who would even contemplate negotiating a formal enterprise agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>So she is saying that the legislation which the government has put before this House and which develops an enterprise agreement has so many impediments to it that no genuine enterprise agreements will be entered into under these arrangements. She goes on in this particular article to talk about the possibilities that, while small business would be advantaged by the enterprise agreements, big business would not be greatly affected because it will have the award arrangements and probably will not enter individual enterprise agreements. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is true that little will be altered for big, unionised business, apart from the changes related to industrial action and secondary boycotts, big firms have small businesses as their suppliers and customers. And given that 60 per cent of workers are employed in businesses that employ 100 workers or fewer, the effective disenfranchisement of small and medium businesses in the Brereton package is of considerable concern.</PARA>
<PARA>I think she hits on the major point of the whole argument that, whilst big business is reasonably happy with the industrial relations reforms and has not made too much public comment because it will be business as usual, those small firms throughout Australia who are contemplating exercising their rights to enter genuine enterprise agreements will find that the impediments that this legislation poses will make it almost impossible for them to enter those agreements. Professor Sloan goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, it is a very pro-union package with an institutionalised right to strike, diluted secondary boycott provisions and an insistence that employers "bargain in good faith". This latter provision is another can of worms likely to involve the Commission. It is also extremely dubious in the context of a system still based on compulsory arbitration. Employers have the "choice" of bargaining in good faith or being forcibly dragged before the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>So, in an outward context, we have enterprise agreements. We also have, with all the trappings within this very complicated legislation, a situation where enterprise agreements will not be entered into. They will just be an add-on to existing awards and conditions. That is absolutely contrary to what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said on a number of occasions. What the government has been advocating in terms of enterprise agreements and in terms of the change of attitude in the whole industrial relations arrangements in Australia and around the world is that individual agreements between the employer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Snow)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! The honourable member is dwelling at some length on the provisions of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill before the Senate, which relates to enterprise agreements. This legislation does not specifically relate to those agreements, and I ask the honourable member to dwell on the provisions of the bill rather than a matter which is before the Senate. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VH4">Mr McARTHUR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your advice, but we have before us an omnibus bill which relates to government instrumentalities and which contains details relating to changes to other legislation, as is mentioned in the title of the legislation. I note speakers on the government side deviated somewhat in some of their discussions. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan), for instance, covered a wide range of topics. I seek your indulgence to cover just some of these issues which do cover the detailed matters before the parliament at this moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, could I move on to the other very important matter of the relationship between the corporations power and the ability to control the new industrial relations package as put forward by the government. As you would be aware, the Tasmanian dams case in 1983 introduced the concept of the foreign affairs power. The ability of the Commonwealth government to control states rights has been hotly debated over the years and various opinions have been expressed on the High Court's interpretation. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has used that example to extend the corporations power to support this current batch of industrial relations legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government has been able to enforce the Commonwealth's attitude in industrial relations through the corporations power. Whilst it is enforcing what we would say is a rigid set of terms and conditions of a very pro-union arrangement where the unions have their finger in the pie of federal awards, unions will be a part of any workplace agreement and will be very much involved in the setting of industrial awards and so-called enterprise agreements. The key element that I think the government and the minister should be aware of is that, whilst the corporations power allows the government to make these arrangements, any future government would have the ability to make a more deregulated market and allow for true and genuine enterprise agreements to be entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wind up by saying that the government in this omnibus bill has brought to bear a range of conditions, which is totally against the thrust of thinking of those people concerned with and close to industrial relations matters both here in Australia and in America and Europe. I find it quite amazing that these detailed arrangements are contrary to the general thrust of the government's thinking, but we know that the ACTU was able to exert its influence on the minister and make sure that the trade union movement was included in the negotiations. Inevitably in the bill a preference clause still remains that the union movement has an undue say in the outcome of many of these so-called enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude in the vain hope that sanity will prevail and that industrial relations, as we know them in Australia, will progress and become more flexible and that the darkness that some of this legislation casts upon the total industrial relations system will be shed at some later time. Inevitably, industrial relations arrangements will become more flexible. As people seek job opportunities and employers try valiantly to help young people to get a job, the cloak of these sorts of restrictive arrangements will be removed and, hopefully, more job opportunities will be created, especially with the sorts of industrial relations programs that the honourable member for Bennelong and the opposition have put forward over the last five to eight years. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As did the honourable member for Corangamite, I want to pick up a comment or two made by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan). When participating in this debate, he applauded the opportunities that had been taken up by the government in job creation. On behalf of the members on this side of the chamber, I agree with his sentiments. The parliament is delighted at the job creation opportunities that have occurred under this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our reservation about the legislation before the House is not meant to be a criticism of the new jobs the government claims to have produced during its term of office. We simply want to state that the legislation does not do sufficient to counter the ongoing problem of unemployment. It fails to address what is Australia's No. 1 social dilemma: unemployment. If I were participating in this debate as a member of the government and the honourable member for Lilley, per chance, were a member of the opposition&mdash;the roles having been reversed&mdash;all hell would have broken loose had the Liberal and National parties been in government during the expansion in unemployment that we have seen since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware, as you are aware Mr Deputy Speaker, of the criticism levelled at the Fraser government during its time in office. It is simply not good enough, in the context of this debate, for the honourable member for Lilley to want to somehow gild the lily&mdash;no pun intended&mdash;by suggesting that all is well in unemployment as a result of the legislation before the House tonight and the legislation which is currently being debated in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not created jobs at a sufficient rate to relieve the exploitation that unemployment currently represents for the community. As the honourable member for Corangamite keeps saying, there is 11 per cent unemployment&mdash;900,000 Australians must be a burden on the conscience of every member of this parliament, particularly members of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lilley says, `Look at what we have done in job creation'. It is not denied by us but it is no way to avoid the fundamental dilemma of unemployment that the nation faces. It is particularly pertinent that there is this level of unemployment while the Australian Labor Party is in power because it has made so much of its history as the representative of employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its monopoly in that area is something I would dispute. But it must be particularly poignant for Labor Party members&mdash;if they are honest with themselves and the nation&mdash;to acknowledge that under their philosophy we have seen this blow-out in unemployment. The legislation is specifically designed&mdash;so they tell us&mdash;to address the unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Corangamite has made the point, as has the honourable member for Bennelong&mdash;and, having heard the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) contribute to this debate before, I have no doubt that she will also want to make the point effectively&mdash;that the opportunity to provide jobs for Australians exists principally through the expansion of small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enterprise agreements that have been part of this total industrial relations package in many cases have been taken up by big business. The challenge that we as parliamentarians face is that of ensuring that those enterprise agreements and the opportunity to be flexible with awards is as appealing to small business as it is to big business. The reservations being expressed by the honourable member for Bennelong, the honourable member for Corangamite&mdash;and I suspect, bold of me as it is to say so, by the honourable member for Pearce&mdash;and me are that this is not the sort of legislation that will allow small business to employ additional employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you have heard the suggestion that members on this side of the House see the solution to unemployment purely in terms of reducing people's take home pay. I do not know how frequently we have to say&mdash;as the honourable members for Bennelong and Corangamite have said&mdash;that we do not intend, as participators in this parliament, to see people with a reduced take home pay. We want to see increased employment opportunities. I know you made the point, sir, about the fact that enterprise agreements are being debated in the Senate. I respect that; but in 30 seconds I will make the observation that it was the enterprise agreements that gave opportunities for new employment in industries with which I am familiar, particularly with the changes that have occurred in the canning industry in the Goulburn  Valley. The passion that members on this side of the House have, is to see that sort of flexibility extended more easily for small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent the farming community. There is no shortage of jobs in rural Australia, as the honourable member for Corangamite can attest. But the reservation that small business employers&mdash;particularly rural employers&mdash;have about putting on additional staff and relieving the burden of unemployment, is about the additional responsibility that unfairly is placed on the employer and not the employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying: allow employers and employees, regardless of the size of the business to negotiate a package which is more attractive for both, so employers are more willing to employ people and relieve some of the current unemployment levels being felt by this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular focus of the bill is referred to in the address from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). The title of the head of the Remuneration Tribunal  is changed from chairman to president, to ensure the title is gender neutral. Along with the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), I am not opposed to that&mdash;but I am a shade bemused that we should find ourselves caught up in so many pages of legislation in what is an exercise in nothing more than gender neutrality, when very few people find the terms president and chairman offensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will not oppose that measure, we merely point out the absurdity of having additional paper generation and legislation to address something that is not important, when we have a major human dilemma of unemployment continuing on the horizon&mdash;and not being addressed effectively by the government. The techniques that the opposition has suggested, and that would allow greater flexibility in employment, are largely being ignored by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think a change to industrial relations is the key that will unlock employment opportunity, yet the key has not been put in the lock&mdash;much less turned&mdash;because all the legislation we have dealt with has been frustrating in industrial relations terms. The change from chairman to president only represents further regulation in an area that desperately needs to be deregulated. I will quote briefly from the speech given by the Minister when he introduced the amendments now being debated by the House. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act . . . will assist Comcare and licensed authorities to recover certain overpayments which may occur when an employee who is receiving workers compensation benefits retires and becomes entitled to superannuation benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>We all understand that. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment introduces a scheme that will enable the overpayment to be recovered from the superannuation fund concerned, rather than from the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition proposed amendments in the Senate which, taken as a whole, would have had the effect of preventing the government's proposed recovery mechanism from operating. The opposition was concerned that the amendments gave Comcare and licensed authorities&mdash;presently Australia Post and Telecom&mdash;unprecedented access to a retired employee's superannuation funds. Let me emphasise that the recovery mechanism only operates if the retiree actually receives, or rolls over, a superannuation benefit. Where the benefit is preserved, the amendments will not operate.</PARA>
<PARA>The fundamental concern the opposition has is that there has been far too little supervision of the whole question of the work cover and Comcare arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had situations in my office, as I suspect most honourable members have, where I have wondered how real the work cover demands were that were being made by the employee. I found very little opportunity to supervise both the work cover arrangements and the legislation that currently obliged Comcare and licensed authorities to meet these compensation benefits. The opposition believes that there should be greater flexibility in this area to enable those authorities to ensure that the funds are recovered from the appropriate source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated in my remarks, the opposition's concern with this legislation is that there has been far too little flexibility in the whole area of industrial relations, far too little opportunity for small business to avail itself of the same employment opportunities and of the same changes in enterprise agreements as currently apply to big business. Our plea to the government is to allow greater flexibility in this area to allow small business to play its role in ensuring that unemployed Australians have an opportunity to find permanent work. </PARA>

<PARA>I would like to leave that interview for a moment and go to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> dated 4 September 1993 titled `The labour reform that wasn't'. We will have a look at Mr Kelty's desire to leave politics out of job creation. The second paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unravelling of the reform process of industrial relations minister Laurie Brereton guarantees that industrial relations will be a political problem for the Keating Government for the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conspiracy theory says that Brereton and Paul Keating were led into a no-win situation by the ACTU; the blunder theory holds that Brereton and Keating misjudged union resistance to their proposal to free-up the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this week's ACTU congress in Sydney, the trade unions rudely removed any doubt about their opposition to the Brereton reform package. The Government and the unions are now working on an alternative proposal from ACTU strategist Bill Kelty which would continue the ban on certified non-union deals, instead encouraging the use of flexibility provisions in existing awards and allowing some non-unionised workplaces to form their own unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole exercise has become an embarrassment of Labor's own making, with all sides blaming everybody else. A prime example of that is the Prime Minister's speech to the Institute of Company Directors on April 21 in which he first flagged his desire to see a much greater spread of enterprise bargaining in the non-union sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kelty and the ACTU president, Martin Ferguson, were both away at the time, and mystified union officials reacted angrily to what was interpreted as a tackle from Keating.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for the non-politicisation of industrial relations. Further on in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> interview, this time in response to Peter McCutcheon, Bill Kelty said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The figures on the traineeship scheme are now quite startling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .                     . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it's not the figures. It's really what it means for young people. And it means giving them a bit of confidence and a bit of hope, broader skills and most important, a bit of confidence in themselves. And from where Lindsay and I have sat, basically we've been out there barracking for young people, trying to show the rest of Australia that a number of people do care&mdash;they care about the future of young people, they believe in them  and, because they believe in them, believe in the future of this country.</PARA>
<PARA>That probably made Mr Kelty and a few others feel warm and fuzzy, but it will take more than cosy rhetoric to solve the problems. While Mr Kelty and Mr Fox can be congratulated on their initiative, I think there are many real things that could have been done via the Industrial Relations Reform Bill instead of fiddling, as I said before, on the fringes with all these other bits and pieces that have no bearing on the real issues facing this country in terms of industrial relations reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was at this point in this interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> that Lindsay Fox responded to Peter McCutcheon. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well, it's 16 months since we started the road show. We started at Bairnsdale. The first day, we finished with the community asking for one person to come forward and we placed a young lady in a job at the Bairnsdale Base Hospital. Some three days later, the people from that community working at the Bairnsdale Base Hospital all elected to give back their 17.5 per cent loading as a donation. The hospital, in turn, ultimately then put on six people which helped the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We found that spirit right throughout all of our travels in Australia&mdash;the elements of caring and sharing.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps Mr Kelty and Mr Brereton could go and tap into this community spirit&mdash;which I think is quite wonderful, genuinely&mdash;to see whether the community will go a step further. Instead of applying a jobs levy and taxing the Australian public any more, why do they not bite the bullet and start developing industrial relations reforms that make a difference? They could start with the 17 1/2 per cent loading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be properly argued that all Australians should forgo this loading at this particular time in Australia's history when we have one million people out there without a job, without the opportunity to earn and, more importantly, without the opportunity to develop the work ethic and have the joy of going daily to a place of work to feel like they have done their bit. For many people, work is about more than just money. So I appeal to the Australian people to forgo, at least for the time being, the 17 1/2 per cent leave loading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Fox and Mr Kelty can create six jobs at one institution, the Bairnsdale Base Hospital, it does not take much to imagine what can be done Australia wide if the whole Australian community participated in that kind of a job creation program. But that will take more than rhetoric; it will take courage and action, and today we need action to put in place industrial legislation that does more than merely fiddle around the fringes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the work of Lindsay Fox and Bill Kelty in helping to fill positions under the Federal government's jobskill program is commendable, more has to be done in this country than merely talking about the problem and undertaking small programs. If Mr Kelty is really serious in his quest to help provide more jobs, why is he not addressing on behalf of the ACTU some of the other industrial relations reforms which have not been addressed in the recent bill?

<PARA>I do not know which rock the minister was hiding under, but that is not the story I get from the business community as I move about my electorate. This bill does nothing. As far as enterprise bargaining is concerned, it is a Clayton's bill which does nothing to bring the two sides together. Indeed, the bill will create more divisive situations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was saying that, while this government fiddles with masses of legislation on various aspects of industrial relations, the real issues go unattended. In fact, my colleague Senator Crane raised this issue when he spoke to a Senate committee recently. He pointed out that there are now 11 separate acts on industrial relations, not to mention the numerous ILO provisions which additionally complicate industrial relations policy and, now, a clutch of miscellany in this Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill. I want to quote the conclusion of the second reading speech given by the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan), who represents the Minister for Industrial Relations. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In essence, Mr President, this bill will create an effective framework for enterprise bargaining and build on the reforms of the last decade. By tailoring those reforms to the needs of 21st century Australian workplaces, it will give our firms the ability to compete with the best companies in the world, many of whom are located in the Asia-Pacific region, the region we have only recently begun to call our own.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Business Council had something to say about that. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper of 7 August 1993, an article entitled `A Shock to the System' refers to the BCA report, which concluded in this vein:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Despite reforms to the processes the structure of Australia's industrial relations system is much the same as it was a decade ago. The question this raises is whether the changes in policies and practices, notwithstanding the static nature of the system itself have been enough to underpin the development of truly international, competitive enterprises."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It's answer to this crucial question is no. At best a quarter of Australian enterprises rank themselves on a par with the best of their competitors, while the typical Australian enterprise is operating at 70 per cent of best practice.</PARA>
<PARA>The article finishes with these two paragraphs:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the Government and the ACTU have tried to make the existing system, with its union monopoly underpinned by an extensive system of industrial awards work better . . . and have made the policy decision to shift from centralised wage fixation to enterprise bargaining within this system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have left the old institutional structures in place, undermining the capacity of the system to deliver real reform and leaving open the possibility of a return to the old system should the unions so decide.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unpalatable message for the Keating Government and its new Minister for Industrial Relations, Laurie Brereton, is that this old mould has to be decisively broken. Effective industrial relations reform does not allow an each-way bet.</PARA>
<PARA>I was also quite surprised by some of the articles on Mr Kelty's idea on industrial reform because I understand that he is on the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia. In November of this year it put out a paper entitled `Towards Full Employment' which was a submission to the committee on employment opportunities. It talked in quite a lot of depth about structural unemployment and the causes. On page 8 of that paper some of the things it lists are not being addressed in the industrial relations reform that we are seeing today. They include changes in industrial relations arrangements which make it more difficult for the unemployed to offer their services at a realistic wage rate; secondly, sustained real wage increases which exceed underlying productivity growth and so make it unprofitable to employ at the margin, such as wage rises which were masked by the superannuation legislation and which required the employers yet again to make the sacrifices; and, thirdly, large rises in labour on-costs such as workers compensation, payroll tax, training and other levies indexed to the payroll, which also add to the unit cost of employing labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by challenging my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House&mdash;in fact, by challenging all Australians&mdash;to move beyond the cosy deals, the rhetoric, the public relations exercises and the grab for more and better at the expense of those among us who are unemployed. There are a lot of folk hurting in the community, and it is wrong. It is wrong because, for all the talk about economic slumps and difficult conditions in other countries, in this nation we have the ability, the opportunity and the will, but do Mr Kelty, Mr Ferguson, the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have the courage to drop the political agenda and the self-interest to match their sentiments with their actions and bring about real change, create real jobs for those folk in Australia who have already waited too long to enjoy the fair go and the same opportunities as the rest of us enjoy?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The training guarantee scheme was established by legislation introduced into this House on 18 May 1990, and it came into effect on 1 July 1990. It requires employers to spend a minimum amount on training. The scheme was introduced as part of the government's policy over the last several years to develop the appropriate environment in which Australian industry can become more competitive internationally. A fundamental step in this process is the development of a highly skilled work force which can adapt quickly to major changes in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme is an additional mechanism to stimulate industry's commitment to training. As the signs of economic recovery strengthen, we must be prepared for an increase in demand for skilled people. The training guarantee provides an important underpinning to achieve this skilled work force. This bill amends the principal act to give effect to two amendments promised by the government in the election context and also includes other amendments to minimise compliance costs and give greater flexibility to the scheme. In line with election commitments, the bill provides employers with enhanced flexibility to plan training expenditure over a longer period by allowing excess eligible expenditure incurred in one year to be carried forward to the next year. Although this excess expenditure cannot be carried forward indefinitely, it will assist those employers who have a need to train extensively within a short time frame, but whose training needs may not be so great in the following year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, and in keeping with the same principle, provision is made for employers who have a training expenditure shortfall in one year to make it up through additional training expenditure in the following year. This avoids hasty and unplanned expenditure simply to meet the minimum training requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also committed itself to remove the need for employers to deduct training subsidies provided by government bodies for apprentices and trainees when calculating their net eligible training expenditure. To avoid anomalies, this provision includes any program with training subsidies. As a consequence of this amendment, the minimum allowable apprentice or trainee amount, or `deemed amount' as it is also known, has been doubled to preserve the full incentives effect. It maintains ease of administration for employers who choose to claim the minimum allowable apprentice or trainee amount. Subsequent to the introduction last year of clauses relating to work experience for students and teachers, it became apparent that full-time students 21 years and over were suffering discrimination. The bill removes this anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill widens the range of entities which can group for the purposes of the act, thus giving organisations greater flexibility to maximise their training opportunities. It also specifies that businesses must be related at 30 June to form a group for that year and that a business cannot be a member of more than one group in a particular year. In order to avoid complications concerning responsibility for a shortfall or ownership of an excess, businesses which group will not have access to the carry forward provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To rectify confusion about who is able to design and approve an eligible training program, the bill simplifies these requirements. It specifies that the person or persons who design or approve the program must, between them, have a working knowledge of the subject area of the program and the skills necessary to design or conduct the relevant type of training program. The bill rectifies anomalies about the use of equipment for training by extending the concept of eligible training expenditure. It will now include rental, hire, lease or depreciation expenses on property or equipment for any part of the year during which the employer uses the property or equipment specifically for eligible training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill aligns the training guarantee legislation with a recent amendment to the Australian corporations and securities legislation relating to the appointment of an administrator for liquidation purposes. In summary, this bill encompasses a number of measures to make the legislation more business-friendly, especially for the small business sector. These amendments offer significant benefits to business and their retrospectivity to 1 July 1993 will ensure their immediate use on receiving assent. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

These foreign locations were to be prescribed by regulation but because of various practical difficulties this requirement is to be removed. The effect will be that, subject to certain conditions, the fringe benefits tax exemption will apply in respect of any employee working outside of Australia where there is no suitable medical treatment available at the place where the work is carried out.

As a result of the wording of the defined terms `all-day parking' and `commercial parking station', employers can use night fees charged by commercial parking station operators and fees charged at kerbside parking meters to value car parking benefits. The use of these fees result in a lower taxable value for car parking benefits which does not reflect the value of the benefit provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, car parking provided by employers in non-CBD areas may be subject to fringe benefits tax where there are kerbside parking meters within one kilometre of the parking facility.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second amendment for infrastructure borrowings will extend the scope of such borrowings to infrastructure facilities constructed on any crown lease of land.

Both parties must intend the lease to continue for at least 25 years after the facility becomes income producing.

However, companies with estimated tax of less than $8,000&mdash;that is, a small company&mdash;will not be covered by this requirement. This bill implements these measures.

<PARA>This amendment which has been circulated in my name seeks to delete in its entirety the whole of part 7, which comprises clauses 45 to 54. The reasons for this amendment were explained amply and cogently by my colleague and learned friend the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), who pointed out the severe disability which could be imposed upon many working men and women in this country if the proposals in those particular sections comprising part 7 were carried forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It contained the rather extraordinary proposition that, if it were deemed that some overpayment of an entitlement had been made, the mere service of a notice on the superannuation fund would give rise to a liability for repayment. That seems to us&mdash;and I would have thought to the government as well&mdash;to have surely been an oversight. Surely this pro-worker government could not be so arbitrary and high handed about the rights and entitlements of Australian workers. I would be completely astonished if it were. I would naturally welcome any explanation that might be forthcoming from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). The honourable member for Tangney did go into this at some length and put a very cogent case during the second reading debate. </PARA>

But I take the opportunity of recording my concern with what can only be called a form of verbal fundamentalism or verbal fanaticism which has crept into our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody has any objection to the removal from statutes of words that are clearly offensive to either men or women, but to take an axe to an ancient and beautiful language in the name of political correctness is something that I find deeply offensive.

It is an important amendment.

Unfortunately, as is usual with this pig-headed, obstinate, insensitive government led by a Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;who is not known throughout the length and breadth of the land, nor might I say overseas, for being reticent in his use of the English language&mdash;the minister is not here to take account of this amendment that we have put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not know about the minister, but I can tell honourable members that the people I talk to tell me that superannuation has become so complex that there is no-one who understands it all. We can no longer go to someone and say, `Hey, this is my situation. This is how much I earn and how much I have put into this superannuation pot. This is what I would like to do. This is my age and my situation in life. Please tell me what the regulations say I can do'. No-one can give an answer.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have lots of employees in the Commonwealth Public Service. Off the top of my head, I think we have about 160,000 employees. A big point has been made that the Hawke Labor government created 500,000 jobs&mdash;half a million jobs&mdash;in the mid-1980s. Do honourable members know how they were created? They were created in the public sector. They were not in the private sector; they were created in the public sector.

Oh no, not this government. This government believes in producing page after page of legislation to become statute and add to regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry is being decimated. To administer the superannuation guarantee levy has become so complex that company after company says that its on-costs are 10, 15 or 20 per cent higher than they should be. In fact, there are companies that say that their costs to administer the superannuation guarantee levy are greater than the money they put into it which might advantage their employees some day. How much do their employees contribute? Nothing. They do not contribute because the government's rules say, simply put, that employers must contribute towards superannuation for their employees. But, if the employees themselves put money into superannuation, there is no tax benefit&mdash;none at all. So what advantage is there to an employee to take after-tax income and put it into superannuation to save for a rainy day?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has proposed that part 7 of the bill be amended. Let me explain briefly why the government cannot accept the opposition's amendment. The bill introduces a mechanism to facilitate the recovery by Comcare of overpayments of compensation to retirees from administrators of superannuation funds, but only for money that falls due for payment to the relevant retired employee. Comcare is required under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to recover overpayments. Under the present arrangement, when a recipient of compensation receives an overpayment, Comcare is required to seek to recover money from individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current mechanism is inappropriate and can cause hardship to employees for a number of reasons. Firstly, repayment from an individual's own savings may cause hardship, particularly when the overpayment is a large one. Secondly, the existing mechanism involves a process which may be drawn out and expensive. In this regard, following negotiations between Comcare and the employee, if an overpayment has not been recovered, the debt may need to be pursued through the courts. Thirdly, where the amount of an overpayment is relatively small, recovery action may not, for various reasons, be cost effective for Comcare and the relevant sum of money may therefore have to be written off. In summary, the current regime is inconvenient and potentially expensive, both for individuals and Comcare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of this debate, the opposition has raised several concerns about the operation of part 7. These concerns can be summarised as follows: the new part 7 operates inequitably and jeopardise an individual's superannuation entitlements. In that regard, the opposition has indicated a concern that the amendments allow Comcare to issue a notice to a superannuation administrator if it considered that it had made, or may have made, an overpayment of compensation. This is essential for the operation of the recovery mechanism because it is not possible for Comcare to determine the extent of the overpayment, or whether in fact there is an overpayment that can be recovered under this scheme, until it has been advised of the retiree's superannuation entitlement and his or her election as to the way in which that entitlement will be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition also alleged that the amendments allowed Comcare to effectively freeze an employee's superannuation entitlement. This is not correct. The following safeguards have been included in the scheme to protect the rights and income of retirees affected by its operation. If superannuation payments have commenced, the proposed recovery mechanism will not operate. This protects the retiree's income stream. Comcare and licensed authorities will be required to continue paying full compensation until the relevant superannuation fund administrator has been informed of the exact amount of the overpayment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When compensation payments are reduced, the relevant administrator will be in a position to commence superannuation payments, thus ensuring a regular income for the retired employee. There may be a short period&mdash;envisaged to be not more than two to four weeks&mdash;when the retired employee may not receive the full amount of superannuation if the arrears of superannuation are insufficient to cover the overpaid compensation in full. During that period, the balance of overpayment will be deducted from superannuation payments until the overpayment has been repaid in full. Comcare's determination of the amount of the overpayment is reviewable. An individual may seek the review of Comcare's determination through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that this type of scheme is not unprecedented in Commonwealth legislation. Sections 1172 to 1176 of the Social Security Act 1991 provide for a similar scheme to that proposed in part 7 of the bill. The Social Security Act provisions allow the Commonwealth to recover social security overpayments directly from another party who is liable to pay compensation to the recipient where such payment would lead to the overpayment of social security entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee might like to note that the Senate Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills did not make any adverse comment on the operation of this part of the bill. Also, the Attorney-General's Department has advised that there are no adverse privacy implications arising from the scheme and that the proposed administrative review mechanisms are appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the government took note of the opposition's concerns about part 7 as expressed in the debate on the bill in the Senate. In the minister's second reading speech in the House he stated the government's commitment to `reviewing the operation' of the new recovery mechanism and to `take action as necessary to ensure it is working effectively and in a manner which safeguards the rights of individuals'. The government does not support the opposition amendment as proposed in this place, but it stands by its commitment to review and change the new scheme as necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 is a fairly weighty tome, as can be seen from the bill itself. This is the third and final set of amendments this year to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. Most of those amendments have in fact been picked up by the government from the coalition's proposals that it took to the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill proposes amendments in four particular areas: firstly, to establish the Torres Strait Regional Authority; secondly, to devolve some financial functions to regional councils; thirdly, to establish an electoral review panel; and, fourthly, to strengthen the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and bodies which it in turn funds. I will talk a little about each of those areas. Then I will talk a little about the elections that have recently taken place as part of this amendment bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Torres Strait Regional Authority will be established as a body corporate and will operate in much the same way as ATSIC itself but will be independent of it. Hopefully, the authority will eliminate many of the current areas of duplication between the Torres Strait Island Coordinating Council and ATSIC. The elimination of that duplication of course is welcomed by members of the coalition. However, whilst we recognise the good sense in rationalising multiple government inputs into the Torres Strait&mdash;when I was there some months ago we counted some 37 different government departments, federal and state, that function into those islands of a few thousand people&mdash;we want to make it clear that our support for those measures does not reflect support for independence. We are talking about some local self-management measures. Our support is not for independence or separate sovereignty. That concern has certainly been raised in that part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), a number of others&mdash;including my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), who is at the table&mdash;and I were in the Torres Strait some months ago, we met with the elected leaders of the island community. They made it very clear and specifically said to us that, whilst they are looking for a large measure of some self-management in a whole range of areas, they did not want to separate from Australia. They were not looking for separate sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some concerns in this area. When this bill first went through the Senate before it came to this place, some of my Senate colleagues noted some of those concerns. One is that we do not believe that we can be talking about any treaties. That has been mentioned in the context that, under international law, that is not appropriate. But, certainly, we might well look at some form of a document and that of course is a task for the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to make it clear that, in terms of looking at some greater local autonomy for the area, Australia's security and international arrangements are critical. These must be held to the national government. Other Queenslanders are living on the Torres Strait Islands as well as the Torres Strait Islanders themselves. Their representation in any future models must also be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had some concerns about the fact that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) indicated to Islanders that self-government by the year 2001 is an option. But the Queensland government has not supported this, so one has to ask whether it is fair to raise expectations when there is not even agreement between the two Labor governments. My colleague Senator Boswell, in the Senate, quoted the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs&mdash;when this bill went through that place recently&mdash;as saying that self-government by 2001 was highly likely, provided Torres Strait residents established a uniform goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the minister is saying that sort of thing&mdash;which certainly is not proposed in this legislation&mdash;and is raising expectations, it is fair to ask how far the Queensland and the federal governments are prepared to go. It is time they came clean and told us where things stand. There have been suggestions that the Torres Strait might adopt a form of constitution based on the Norfolk Island model, or even the Cook Islands model, in its relationship with New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins said in the other place during debate on this bill that the establishment of the Torres Strait regional authority should not be confused with any form of self-government for Torres Strait Islanders as the government `does not have a position on that at this time' and has not taken a policy position on the Torres Strait Islands. So we are getting conflicting signals from the government. Although Senator Collins said that he has no conflict with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, who was merely expressing a hope, I believe it would be appropriate for the minister to confirm that the government has no policy for self-government or independence for the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Dodd" NAMEID="EV5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about self-determination?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UT4">Mr NUGENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. The honourable member should be patient and not worry; he will get his turn. Let us have a sensible, rational debate instead of all the barracking and usual diatribe we get from that end of the woods. Let us talk a bit about the devolution of powers to the regional councils. This bill strengthens reporting arrangements and accountability requirements for the regional councils. It provides them with increased funding responsibilities, with wider powers to approve funds and issue guarantees. These powers may also be suspended if deemed necessary by the ATSIC chairperson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional councils will now be required to provide draft budgets which are tied to a regional plan for their region. ATSIC will have the power to remove regional councillors who fail to perform functions or comply with budget or reporting requirements. The devolution of power to regional councils means, as this is now being taken away from the central Canberra bureaucracy&mdash;certainly a direction that we would support&mdash;that we should be able to cut back on the size of some of that central bureaucracy. We should ensure that the money thus saved is put towards tangible projects to improve the welfare of indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome those moves and also the moves in the bill which strengthen the power of ATSIC to deal with people who do not perform satisfactorily. This is essential in any organisation, regardless of its size, so it can achieve peak performance and optimum accountability. It is important to remember that a crucial aspect of self-management, resting with regional councils, lies with their function of allocating funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is testimony to their success in that role, and their willingness to take some of the hard decisions, that a large number of complaints&mdash;which certainly come into my office about ATSIC&mdash;are from those who fail to convince their regional councils of their need for funding. In other words, the councils do not just distribute money willy-nilly or with gay abandon; they take their job very seriously. They are to be commended for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important aspect is the streamlining of ATSIC, after its first three years, by reducing it from 60 to 35 regional councils. To achieve high standards of administrative excellence, it is necessary to have measures to allow for the removal of regional councils which fail to comply with their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly agree with Senator Kernot in the other place who said, when this bill was being debated, that self-determination&mdash;I would use the word `self-management'&mdash;should be seen as a non-controversial statement of Aboriginal people seeking maximum community independence whilst remaining part of the nation state. ATSIC now proceeds to the next important stage of its development&mdash;and hopefully its consolidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now I would like to talk about the Office of Evaluation and Audit. The provisions in this bill are in addition to the functions already conferred on the Auditor-General. So we are not talking about replacing the Auditor-General but about additional functions. The bill will significantly expand the Office of Evaluation and Audit to include regular audit and evaluation of ATSIC, Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, the Commercial Development Corporation and the Torres Strait Regional Authority. It also provides the mechanism to allow the minister or ATSIC to request the evaluation and audit of particular aspects of the operation of regional councils, any individual, body corporate or unincorporated body receiving one or more grants or loans from ATSIC&mdash;or any borrowers whose loans have been guaranteed by ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be the coalition's intention in government to review where the Office of Evaluation and Audit is situated within the structure of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs&mdash;whether it would be more appropriate in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, where the minister is, with the Auditor-General or somewhere else. The object of such a move would be to make sure the body was even more independent than it is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We moved amendments in the Senate, which were defeated, to require that the auditing and evaluation process be more extensive than it is. That was defeated. We will not reintroduce that amendment in this place because we do not have the numbers. But we would have preferred to have seen more responsibility for more extensive auditing and evaluation than is in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are pleased that the government has finally moved&mdash;I suggest it is a response to pressure from us&mdash;to require organisations receiving funding from ATSIC to be publicly accountable for those funds. I make the point that there are other areas in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, on behalf of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, are receiving funds through other mechanisms which are not touched by this legislation. Therefore, they are not subject to the scrutiny that we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would like to see the same standard of scrutiny applied to those outside the ATSIC funding umbrella. A prime example of the need for this has been placed before us today with the tabling of the Auditor-General's efficiency report No. 20 into the Northern Land Council. I will mention briefly some of the key points from that report because they are illustrative of why we need to look at organisations outside ATSIC's control, as well as those directly under it. I will indicate some of the key findings. Under the heading `Administration of Royalty Trust Accounts', it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Practices did not comply with the provisions of the ALR Act in several respects.</PARA>
<PARA>Under `Advances to Council Members and Chairman', it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advances of the type undertaken are not accepted in other Commonwealth authorities and contravenes a resolution of the Full Council. It results in additional administrative costs and the write off of uncollectable advances.</PARA>
<PARA>It talks about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Flexible remuneration packages involving significant fringe benefits for certain senior. . . staff were implemented without the required approval.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Controls over the selection and management of consultants provided insufficient assurance that value for money and accepted public contracting practices were pursued.</PARA>
<PARA>It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inadequacies were found in the application of expenditure control procedures.</PARA>
<PARA>Further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excess administrative funds were distributed against the express wishes of the Minister and have contributed to a significant reduction in Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account funds.</PARA>
<PARA>We are not talking about small amounts but literally millions of dollars. I understand that in terms of some of the investments, motor vehicle activity, air fare activity and various other areas, management and administration have been appalling. The new director of the NLC has undertaken to put things right. The NLC has accepted something like 49 of the 52 recommendations made by the Auditor-General. I can say categorically that he will have our full support in putting those corrective measures in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister: what is he going to do about those who transgressed over an extended period, some of whom are still very much on the federal payroll? In view of this type of example, I urge the minister to give the Office of Evaluation and Audit power to look at all Aboriginal organisations. The need for this is amply illustrated in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all concerned that taxpayers' money does not necessarily hit the mark in this very important area. We have talked many times in this place and elsewhere about the severe disadvantage in the Aboriginal community and the need to improve the well-being of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. No amount of accounting for funds can ensure proper management. The principle of the Office of Evaluation and Audit is not only audit but also evaluation. We are looking for value for money and commonsense spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem has as much to do with policy direction within ATSIC as it has with bean counting, and it is the minister's ultimate responsibility to do something about it. Let me give the House a simple example of what I mean. In the last seven or eight months, I have travelled to probably 70 or 80 Aboriginal communities through the length and breadth of this country. I visited a community of about 400 in the Pitjantjatjara lands in South Australia. The old community store had literally fallen over&mdash;it was rotten, rat infested and obviously needing replacement. ATSIC spent something like $750,000 providing a much needed new store. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem was that the new store, half of which stood empty, was twice if not three times the size needed and could have serviced a population of 4,000 let alone 400. Yet, 100 yards down the road, the antiquated health centre could have done with some money being spent on it. If a sensible decision had been made so that we had a new store of a sensible size, we could well have saved enough money to put some valuable resources into the health centre. We simply have to find a better way of looking at the way the money is spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the electoral review panel. The purpose of this clause of the bill is to review electoral boundaries, the grouping of the regions and wards within the boundaries and the electoral system generally, and to then report to the minister. There have been criticisms to the effect that the arrangements for the elections for ATSIC held last Saturday were carried out too hastily and without adequate consultation, particularly in relation to the planned system of wards. The coalition is in favour of the establishment of an electoral review panel so that there will be time for consultation and proper planning prior to the next set of elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the record number of nominations for the elections, and we acknowledge that many candidates who had previously been non-supportive of ATSIC have now decided to have a go. There has been an increased number of enrolments. Interestingly, 400 more candidates stood this time than for the 1990 election. Of the 2,001 nominations, 700, or 35 per cent, were women candidates. In the federal election, it was only 25 per cent, so in that sense women are doing better in the Aboriginal community than they are in the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, voter turnout was disappointing&mdash;barely up one per cent overall, although it was variable across the country. If we cannot get support for that elective process, we must ask ourselves whether ATSIC is the correct structure for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. No improvement in three years is chastening. After six years, we should be expecting a better voter turnout and demonstrable results and programs on the ground. If we are not seeing those things, we will have to seriously question whether we have the right structure and whether it will ever work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that many of the people involved in what is sometimes called the `Aboriginal industry'&mdash;people in the bureaucracy, the lobby groups and so on&mdash;are obviously locked into standing for election, but they are not necessarily reflective of the broader community because the broader community is not voting in large numbers. As I have gone around the communities, it seems that the broad numbers in those communities are much more concerned with fundamental issues of day-to-day survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about whether ATSIC is the appropriate structure for the majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Particularly in recent times, it seems that that body has been giving more open partisan support to the government and that a number of Aboriginal leaders have increasingly been talking about treaties and sovereignty, when those communities I mentioned are really talking about health, housing, education and jobs for their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I called into voting places during the elections. At one place I introduced myself to one of the officials from the Electoral Commission who called herself a `liaison officer'. When I asked her what her job was, her lack of training and understanding of what was required were quite apparent. I was worried that the election was not conducted properly. There are concerns about whether all the votes were properly recorded in some places. We will have to give much more care to that area in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern is the delay in counting the vote. In many areas this will take weeks and, in some cases, months. Frankly, although some of those electorates are very remote and dispersed, it is beyond my comprehension why counting should take months. ATSIC has contributed $4 million to the Electoral Commission to run that election. Even if everybody who is eligible voted, the number of actual voters is still only the equivalent of three federal electorates however dispersed. If we talk about the number of people who actually voted it would represent only one federal electorate. As we all know in this place, those votes can be counted in one night. Even in dispersed electorates the votes can be counted in a lot less time than several months. So, for the sake of Aboriginal people themselves, we must do better in future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the amendments made to this bill by the government and the Australian Democrats in the Senate. In the previous amendment bill No. 2, we amended the number of commissioners of ATSIC from the present appointed chairperson, two other appointed commissioners and 17 elected commissioners to two appointed and 17 elected, from which the minister would appoint the chair. The Democrats abandoned their principle on that particular matter&mdash;they voted with us on the last occasion. They have changed their mind, presumably under pressure, and voted with the government, so that we now have an amendment which means we only have 17 elected members, with the chairperson being elected from those 17. And, because the chairperson is required to come and live in Canberra, it means that one of those regions will effectively be left unrepresented. The reasons for the original amendment are still valid&mdash;we are only talking about a couple of months ago, for goodness sake&mdash;and I must record the coalition's disappointment at the Democrats' lack of resolve and consistency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the other amendment made in the Senate, which inserts a preamble of six paragraphs. I agree with much that is there. Amongst other things, it talks about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people being the original inhabitants; the desire of Australian people to rectify the problems of the past; making sure there is a maximum participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the formulation and implementation of policies. Nobody would support that more than the coalition. The preamble also talks about the need to improve economic status, promote social wellbeing and improve the provision of community services. Certainly, that would be consistent with trying to break the welfare mentality, and we would be supportive of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I urge caution with respect to the final paragraph introduced, where it talks about the Australian government acting to protect the rights of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders by recognising international standards, and what follows in that vein. The principle of that paragraph is fine but, as expressed, it needs some caution lest we are seen to be ceding some of our national sovereignty, which indeed would be dangerous ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not oppose this legislation. We are disappointed that the government would not deal with us on the amendments we put forward. The government indicated its preparedness to discuss amendments and we put them forward, but there was no discussion&mdash;they were rejected willy-nilly. It seems that that is becoming a trend on the part of the minister and his government. This is not the first time that we have gone to this minister and sought a bipartisan approach&mdash;an approach which he frequently espouses&mdash;only to be rejected. We seem to be establishing something of a pattern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we certainly welcome the measures in the bill relating to the Office of Evaluation and Audit, the devolution of responsibility to regional councils, increased accountability, the establishment of the electoral review panel&mdash;undoubtedly, there is room for substantial improvements in that area&mdash;and the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned about the government's inability to control problems in non-ATSIC funded organisations, such as the NLC, for the sorts of reasons that I talked about earlier. We register our cautious attitude to the final part of that preamble and object to the changes affecting the make-up of the commission and the appointment of the chairperson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final message is that we will be watching to see whether these measures actually make a difference in improving the health, prosperity and quality of life of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. If not, we will certainly seek changes&mdash;because that is the bottom line of what this legislation should be about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 3) is of great personal interest to me and, more importantly, to my constituents of Leichhardt who reside in the Torres Strait. The bill provides for major changes to arrangements for the Torres Strait, including the establishment of a Torres Strait Regional Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be confining my comments to this aspect of the bill, which also deals with other matters relating to the functions of ATSIC. In establishing the regional authority to exercise ATSIC powers with respect to Islanders and Aboriginal residents in the Torres Strait, this bill is responding directly to calls from the Torres Strait Islanders who are resident in the Strait and the island communities of the northern peninsula area of Bamaga and Seisia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Torres Strait, it is very trite to say but true, is a long way from Canberra. There was a feeling in the Torres Strait that its best interests would be served if ATSIC funding decisions were made on Thursday Island&mdash;not Canberra, and certainly not Brisbane or even Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A function of the new authority will be to recognise and maintain the special and unique `Ailan Kastom' of the Torres Strait Islanders, as well as the customs and traditions of Aboriginal people in the area. Ailan Kastom is defined in the legislation as the body of customs, traditions, observances and beliefs of some or all of the Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait. The strength of this Ailan Kastom is evident to anyone who has had the privilege of visiting the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Torres Strait Regional Council had asked that a new Torres Strait regional authority be established separate from ATSIC. While the commission endorsed the creation of the authority as the legitimate aspiration of Torres Strait Islanders in the Strait, I am happy to see that the regional council has agreed to ATSIC's proposal to keep the new authority within the framework of the ATSIC Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to commend the regional council for the manner in which it has approached all aspects of the negotiations that have taken place in the process of establishing the new authority. Particular commendation should go to the chairperson, Mr Getano Lui Junior. Mr Lui and all regional councillors are committed to the future of the Torres Strait. I think this vision was most clearly articulated by Getano Lui Junior during his recent Boyer Lecture which was delivered to the ABC. I would like to quote extensively from Mr Lui's Boyer Lecture. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Torres Strait Islanders are not trying to abandon Australia. When I hear people accuse us of that I cannot help but think of how, in the 1970s, the Australian Government wanted to give away some of our people and islands to a foreign country. I don't think Australians have anything to teach us about loyalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fact is, today Australia tries to manage our affairs through the representatives of nearly 40 official agencies and departments, none of whose officials are accountable to our region or our people. To participate in Australia as citizens we must change this status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to prejudge the exact relationship which may develop. Perhaps we will negotiate over the next years some new status&mdash;in time for the 2001 anniversary of the Constitution. Whether we and our Australian negotiating partners find that a specific island territory constitution serves us best, or a new Australian Constitution big enough to embrace Islander and Aboriginal peoples, I cannot tell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at a range of options. None of these options calls into question our continued association with Australia in culture, spirit or law. We need reforms and improvements&mdash;not a separation and certainly not a divorce.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that this ATSIC Amendment Bill honours the spirit of Mr Lui's Boyer Lecture. It provides for the appropriation of funds from the government to the Torres Strait Regional Authority as a single line allocation in the ATSIC budget following negotiations between the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), the chairperson of ATSIC, the chairperson of the Torres Strait regional authority and the commissioner for the Torres Strait. The funds to be provided to the Torres Strait Regional Authority are to be those presently allocated by ATSIC to the Torres Strait Regional Council and those currently allocated by ATSIC on a national basis in respect of the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this bill does more than provide for the flow of funds from the government to the Torres Strait. Getano Lui Junior in his Boyer Lecture referred to the need for the development of the economic base of the Torres Strait. No region can enjoy a degree of political autonomy without a degree of economic autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides that the Torres Strait regional authority must formulate and revise from time to time a template of the economic future of the Strait to be called the Torres Strait economic development plan. The aim of the plan as stated is to improve the economic, social and cultural status of Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people resident in the Torres Strait. It is intended that the plan will include a marine strategy to ensure that the Torres Strait's most important natural resource is managed in the best possible way to ensure sustainable development alongside economic advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government has accepted ATSIC's advice in regard to the creation of the authority, it has also listened to other concerns coming from the Torres Strait. In response to these calls, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs set up a review of the constitution of the Torres Strait Regional Council and recommendations for the constitution and electoral process for the new Torres Strait regional authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review was conducted recently by a Torres Strait community leader and member of the National Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, Mr Alan Mosby&mdash;who I am sure is known to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) at the table&mdash;and anthropologist Professor Jeremy Beckett. May I commend both Mr Mosby and Professor Beckett for the diligent manner in which the review was conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meetings were held in every community throughout the Torres Strait. The whole of the Torres Strait was aware of the presence of the review team, and its presence in the Torres Strait was welcomed and seen as indicative that this government wants to give the Torres Strait the form of regional authority that residents want and that will work best for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no other issue in this part of my electorate that has created so much community interest and involvement. When one comes down to Canberra and hears debates about industrial relations, the balance of payments, perhaps even sporting grants&mdash;or even the native title legislation, I might say&mdash;it is another world from the Torres Strait. This is the burning issue in this part of my electorate: the nature of the Torres Strait authority in the short term, and the issue of possible regional autonomy in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the enthusiasm for this issue is indicative of the commitment of the Torres Strait people to self-determination as expressed so articulately by Mr Lui. That same enthusiasm and commitment to the future was made clear when Mr Alan Mosby called a public meeting on Thursday Island in October. It was an important meeting attended by many residents of the Strait, and it was addressed by Mr Mosby, Mr Lui, Mr Jim Akee and others. Opinions on the future of the Torres Strait may differ amongst these individuals, but Alan Mosby summed it up when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We live in a glorious country, Australia, where each person has the right to speak up for his own rights.</PARA>
<PARA>I have been very encouraged by the readiness of the people of the Torres Strait to speak up and say what they want and by the active way they have pursued their vision for a Torres Strait Regional Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Torres Strait has an extremely diverse and multicultural population. People have settled there over a long period of time from many countries of the Pacific and Asia&mdash;from Malaysia, Japan, Papua New Guinea, the Solomons, other islands of the Pacific&mdash;and, of course, Europe. The very multicultural nature of the Torres Strait&mdash;especially Thursday Island, Horn Island and Prince of Wales Island&mdash;provides a real challenge for the electoral structure of any possible form of future self-government in the Torres Strait. Obviously the Queensland government, the new authority and the Torres Shire Council will need to work together in negotiating any further steps towards regional autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, amongst those non-indigenous communities there has been some confusion about what the new Torres Strait Regional Authority will mean to them. May I assure those members of the multicultural Torres Strait community that these changes that are currently before the House will affect only those programs and activities funded by ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, it will mean that the CDEP can be managed locally and loans to local businesses can be made at the local level. As well as the establishment of the development fund, the Torres Strait Regional Authority will establish a fund to be known as the Torres Strait housing fund. Anyone who has visited the Torres Strait will know that, although some improvements have taken place in recent years&mdash;especially since the election of the Goss government in 1989&mdash;there is a desperate need for affordable housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in the Torres Strait last month with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, we had a series of quite constructive meetings with a broad cross-section of the community on this very issue. Meetings were held with representatives from the Torres Shire Council, the Tamwoy Development Association, the Mura Kosker Sorority, the Port Kennedy Association, the ATSIC regional council, the Horn Island Residents and Ratepayers Association, and other groups and individuals. I take this opportunity to thank all of those groups for taking the time to talk to both the minister and me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year I had talks on this issue with representative groups in the Torres Strait and, in September, the then Acting Prime Minister, and current Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), visited the Torres Strait.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister Tickner, and I, as the local member, sympathise with expressions of the need for greater autonomy in the Torres Strait region.

But, importantly&mdash;and I say this in answer to the comments of the honourable member for Aston&mdash;this will occur only after consultation with all people in the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people do not seem to understand that the government believes in self-determination. That does not mean imposing some model that the honourable member for Aston, the honourable member for Leichhardt, any other member of this House or any bureaucrat in Canberra thinks might be appropriate for the Torres Strait. It means talking to the people of the Torres Strait. As I have indicated, it is a multicultural society. It is not an easy question for the government or the opposition to answer. I see that the honourable member for Aston agrees with me on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is that, from now on, there has to be continual consultation. As I said earlier, it cannot be just consultation with the government of Queensland or the local councils&mdash;which are obviously important&mdash;but consultation with all the people of the Torres Strait.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make a few brief comments about my observations in recent months. The separationist movement, if I can call it that, has been of some concern. It is encouraging to hear both sides of politics talking about it tonight in a reasonably sensible way. I think it is essential that Aboriginal communities remain part of this nation&mdash;and may that always be so.

On this occasion&mdash;I will not go into it in any great detail&mdash;it was a matter of substance abuse. It reinforced to me the practical responsibility that this parliament has to the Aboriginal people of Australia.

It has been a privilege to work with him, particularly in working through my electorate in recent months. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By doing away with the racist idea of terra nullius&mdash;the idea that this continent had no owners prior to the settlement of Europeans&mdash;the Mabo judgment laid the foundation for a more just future for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The government's legislative response to the High Court's decision on native title is fundamentally about human rights and correcting over 200 years of injustice suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The government, in preparing its legislative response, embarked on a lengthy process of consultations with many groups, including representatives of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. Those representatives who were involved in these discussions participated in a constructive way and showed a willingness to compromise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people showed by their leadership that they are able to rise to the occasion created by the Mabo decision. The way in which the consultation surrounded the drafting of the government's native title legislation demonstrates clearly that the government's approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs is effective. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is the cornerstone of this approach, which is fundamentally about empowering Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to take control of their own destiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation contains the third amendment in a series of amendments to the act under which ATSIC operates. The legislation comes as a result of a review carried out by the commission into the effectiveness of the act. It resulted in a report to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) in February of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main changes contained in this legislation include the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority to replace the existing regional councils in the Torres Strait; the simplification of the financial provisions of the act and the decentralisation of some financial functions to the regional councils; a strengthening of the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit; and the establishment of an electoral review panel. The overall effect of these amendments is to increase the input of local communities in the decision making process within an even more effective and accountable organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the financial aspects of this bill. One of the great myths which unfortunately are believed by a significant section of the population is that ATSIC has a huge budget, a large portion of which is wasted. This fable has no basis in reality. The facts are that the budget of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission in the last financial year was around $788 million. Out of this budget, around 60 per cent is spent on the community development employment program and on the provision of housing and other infrastructure for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This false perception of large amounts of funds being available to ATSIC leads to the mistaken conclusion that there is a lack of accountability in relation to how the money is actually spent. The reality is that, in addition to being subject to the user requirements of public accountability, including examination by Senate estimates committees, by the Auditor-General and by the parliamentary committee system, ATSIC is also subject to scrutiny by the Office of Evaluation and Audit. This body reports directly to the minister and the Chairperson of ATSIC on matters relating to accountability. In addition the budget related paper produced by ATSIC each year contains details of every cent of federal government expenditure in the area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, which as I have said comes as a result of the review of ATSIC by the commissioners themselves, will increase the ability of the Office of Evaluation and Audit to examine the finances of ATSIC funded organisations. Under the changes, the OEA will have the power to evaluate and audit the Commercial Development Corporation and Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, in addition to the proposed Torres Strait Regional Authority and ATSIC itself. The commission and the minister will have the power to direct the OEA to investigate regional councils as well as the recipients of ATSIC, and TSRA grant and loan recipients in some instances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the increased role for the Office of Evaluation and Audit contained in this legislation, it also includes administrative changes that will clear up some anomalies in the act relating to the appointment and conditions of service of the Director of the Office of Evaluation and Audit. Taken together, these amendments will increase the confidence of the broader community in the accountability of ATSIC and related organisations, and will build on the excellent work which is already being done by the commission in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial provisions of this legislation will also result in a decentralisation of power to regional councils. Under the bill ATSIC will be empowered to delegate its powers to a regional council to approve funds and issue guarantees. The commission will have the power to limit these powers through written directions, and any abuse will be subject to sanctions, including suspension of delegates to regional councils by the Chairperson of ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This devolution of power to regional councils is an effective way of increasing the input of local communities, which are in the best position to judge what the needs of the particular community concerned are. It is also in the spirit of the amendments made to the act earlier this year, which are designed to increase the role of regional councils within the structure of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment in this bill which will increase the ability of the indigenous people of Australia to have control over their own destiny is the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. This was referred to at length by the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd). Part 28 of the legislation contains the functions of the new authority, which will be substantially similar to those of ATSIC. An additional requirement will be to recognise and maintain the special and unique Ailan Kastom of Torres Strait Islander life. Ailan Kastom is defined in the bill as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the body of customs, traditions, observances and beliefs of some or all of the Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait area, and includes any such customs, traditions, observances and beliefs relating to particular persons, areas, objects or relationships;</PARA>
<PARA>The establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority is an important step forward in recognising the unique history and separate cultural identity of Torres Strait Islanders. They will have the opportunity to elect representatives to their own separate authority, giving them a say in how government funds are distributed in their communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for ATSIC and the Torres Strait Regional Authority to remain truly accountable to the wishes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to ensure that the electoral system under which these bodies are elected remains effective. To ensure that this occurs, this bill establishes an independent electoral review process which will review and determine the boundaries of regions and awards and the grouping of regions into zones, as well as reviewing and reporting back to the minister on the electoral system by which regional councils are elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When determining the boundaries of regions, the independent review panel will call for submissions and make draft boundary recommendations with an expanded panel which will then hear objections to proposed boundaries. The process will operate on a similar basis to that which operates under the Australian Electoral Act for the determination of boundaries for the House of Representatives. This process will ensure that the regional councils of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission continue to be representative of the communities that they represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will ensure that the process of empowerment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to make decisions to take control of their lives will continue. It is a process that I am sure has been welcomed by many. The bill will ensure improvement in the accountability measures existing for the commission while ensuring that the commission continues to effectively represent the aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to support the amendments in this bill. </PARA>

I think the provisions that are brought forward in this bill are very significant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people&mdash;and, indeed, to all Australians. I believe very strongly that, even though we have to have legislation specifically directed to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, their future cannot be considered in isolation from the future of other Australians. I believe very strongly that Australians have one future together in brotherhood, and we certainly should not take any separate path.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do welcome the bill, which has as its principal functions major changes to the arrangements involving the Torres Strait, including the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. Streamlining the financial divisions of the act is also of great importance. One of the effects of that will be to facilitate the further devolution of authority to regional councils. Strengthening and enlarging the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit is very important. The final provision of the bill is to establish an independent electoral review panel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Torres Strait area is concerned, I welcome the introduction of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. I have visited the Torres Strait on three separate occasions&mdash;first in 1977, then in 1986 and most recently this year when I went there as part of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs inquiry into access and equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have tremendous admiration for the people of the Torres Strait. They are wonderful people. They are intelligent, they are proud and they are good Australians. They have proved that over decades. As the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) said in his speech, it is a pity that more Australians do not have the opportunity of visiting the Torres Strait and experiencing first-hand the warmth, the friendship and the tremendous community spirit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot think of the Torres Strait without thinking of people like George Mye from Darnley Island, whose contribution to Australia has been enormous and whose contribution to the Torres Strait has been very significant indeed. The honourable member for Leichhardt made mention of Mr Getano Lui Jr&mdash;I certainly recall meeting him&mdash;and Getano Lui Sr, who was a great Australian who made a wonderful contribution to the Torres Strait. The honourable member also mentioned Mr Alan Mosby. I have memories of meeting many of the Mosby family&mdash;particularly on York Island and elsewhere&mdash;in the past. I cannot talk about friends and acquaintances in the Torres Strait without mentioning a wonderful woman and a good friend, Mrs Flo Kennedy, who I think is very largely mother to the whole of the Torres Strait. She is one of those great, wonderful, warm, loving human beings who are the epitome of caring and compassion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity of listening to or even reading&mdash;I will make the effort to do so&mdash;the Boyer lecture of Getano Lui Jr. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Leichhardt quote from it. I was particularly pleased that he emphasised the fact that Mr Lui mentioned that his people were part of Australia and were happy to be part of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I believe that among our population of 17.6 million people there is a great deal of misunderstanding. To some extent, this has been fostered and fomented by some people within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community who have a political agenda of their own and who are seeking to put forward the proposition of a country within a country. I have spoken about this in the House before. It is a concept that I reject very strongly. I do not believe it is in the best interests of any Australian, whatever his or her racial origin, to embrace the separatist fantasy of creating a country within a country. I totally reject that concept and I am delighted that Getano Lui Jr made that point in his Boyer lecture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the vast majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are certainly conscious of their own aspirations, their own culture and their own history&mdash;which is a very long one&mdash;can see them evolving, developing and growing within the context of Australian society. I think that is the way we have to go. I think we have to be very careful of the way we use words like `self-determination' and `autonomy' because they are capable of various interpretations. This continues to cause some confusion for some people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the Torres Strait Regional Authority. It is going to be a step in the right direction. Whether it is the Torres Strait Regional Authority or the Coffs Harbour City Council in my electorate, it is the right of Australian citizens to elect their own representatives to get on with the job of running their own local affairs. I see no difficulty in the Torres Strait Regional Authority doing that, and doing it particularly well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note also that part of the legislation provides that the authority must formulate and revise from time to time a plan to be known as the Torres Strait development plan. That is certainly very necessary. The aim of the plan is to improve the economic, social and cultural status of Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal persons living in the Torres Strait area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Torres Strait Islanders are of a mainly Catholic background, with people coming from the Solomons bringing the light&mdash;the introduction of Christianity to Darnley Island. I have had the experience&mdash;I was about to say pleasure, but I changed my mind&mdash;of stalking across that rocky foreshore, which I will not even call a beach, to the point where there is a memorial to the first landing of the missionaries from the Solomons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plan also has to incorporate a marine strategy for improving the economic, social and cultural status of Torres Strait Islanders. I applaud that. I think it is perhaps a pity that here we are in 1993 just now getting to the point of establishing the authority. But, more than that, we are only now at the point of saying, `Okay, the authority is going to be established and it has got to develop this plan'. I think it is a reflection on governments of both sides of politics that only now that we are at this point are we starting to talk about a plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first visited a number of Aboriginal communities in the Torres Strait in 1977, I was struck by the fact that all too often some of the projects appeared to be designed to fail. I say that in a very critical way. I think part of the problem for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians is that they are cast in stereotypes. I think what has happened in the past has been designed to create that system of failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned that before in this House. I have spoken about the number of Aboriginal children from the Macleay Valley in my own electorate who suffer from otitis media. Something like 94 per cent of Aboriginal kids between the ages of three and six suffer from this disease&mdash;glue ear. I will not bore the House by repeating the full details of it. But it is significant in that when these kids start school they are already three years behind, on average, in terms of language development and socialisation. When they get to school they cannot hear, they cannot learn and so they are cast in this role of being dumb. And it is not true. I will not go on with this topic, because it is one of my pet hobby horses. But it does lead me to another area which I will talk about in the time available to me: the provision of health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think back to my visit to Lockhart River in 1977. The federal government of the day, which was of the same political cast as I am, had very generously provided two really good diesel fishing dories to enable the people to establish a fishing industry. Of course, the venture was doomed to failure. The sad thing about it is that this is just one example of what has happened time and time again right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We collectively, as a government, provided these beaut boats but we did not provide any money for nets. We did not provide any money for fuel. If they did get fuel and nets and if they did catch fish, where were they going to market the fish? The only market that one could poke a stick at was at Cairns. The only way of getting to Cairns was by air by bushies&mdash;bush pilots&mdash;in the old DC3s. In order to get the alleged fish that they would catch&mdash;if they ever got the fuel and the nets&mdash;to that market they would have had to freeze them, and then send them to Cairns on the plane which came in two or three times a week. But there was no freezer either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use that as an example of how, right around Australia in past decades, governments of all persuasions have supported a situation that was doomed to failure. That is part of the problem that we have in terms of the lack of role models for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the way that the broader community tends to regard them. This bill provides a framework so that they can succeed and they can be&mdash;I use the words carefully&mdash;involved in regional autonomy. They can do their own thing and they can be responsible for themselves. That is what we are all entitled to, and that is what we all want to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal briefly with the Office of Evaluation and Audit. It is quite important that the powers of this office should be strengthened. It will have the obligation to undertake regular evaluation and audit of the operations of ATSIC, Aboriginal Hostels Ltd and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation. It is a sad fact of life that, because of public perceptions, the expenditure of Commonwealth money by Aboriginal organisations has to be like Caesar's wife&mdash;absolutely above suspicion.

Whilst the Auditor-General's authority and responsibility certainly apply, I think it is excellent that the Office of Evaluation and Audit is going to be strengthened and given more power, because it is very important in terms of public perception that federal and state government money should be seen to be spent properly and not wasted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude by making a point that is always of concern to me. If we are going to consider the future of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, it cannot be done in isolation from the rest of the community. They are Australians first and foremost. As a caring and compassionate society we have to provide for those of our fellow countrymen who are in need; whether they are in need in terms of health, employment or education. It is perhaps not so vital for Torres Strait Islander Australians as it is for Aboriginal Australians. Health is the key. In Torres Strait we have this widespread problem of diabetes that has to be conquered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health strategy for Torres Strait is another item that has been lagging for some time and needs to be addressed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education is the key to success for any individual, whether in this country or anywhere else. We have to pay particular attention to the education services provided for all Australians, but particularly for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who are basically remote. In the report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs that will be submitted on Thursday we are concerned with the question of access and equity for all Australians.

According to the newspapers in Queensland, almost all of the councils in Torres Strait had qualified audit reports last year. One of the ladies who care very greatly and dearly about the Aboriginal councils told me, amongst some fairly copious tears, that the government was going to undermine self-management, was going to undermine the councils and was going to destroy them. When I laid up my shoes as minister for Aboriginal affairs in Queensland only six of the 28 councils had qualified&mdash;that means bad&mdash;reports, or unacceptable reports as far as the Auditor-General was concerned. Four of those were very tiny councils in the Torres Strait. They were not a great deal of worry to us or to the public purse. But now we have only six of the 28 councils not getting qualified reports.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite seriously, I think it would do everyone in this House a great deal of good in understanding the first Australians to listen to the honourable member for Cowper. What he is saying about the undermining of the councils is something that I could see continuously with the do-gooders. Trying to be a practising Christian, I deeply regret having to say this about the missionaries, but a lot of them fit into the same category. I am sure that the little carpenter in Nazareth had no idea that the interpretations of his teachings were going to be such that little children would be taken from their parents. I do not think that this is a matter for jest. Two generations of Australians&mdash;two generations of human beings&mdash;on Cape York Peninsula were taken from their parents. To have done that under the guise of Christianity is unbelievable to me, but that is what happened. I will not pursue that subject any further because I do not have the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the undermining of the councils, the statements of the honourable member for Cowper were very prescient observations and judgments. I cannot mention names because of the vicious vindictiveness of the Queensland government, but that government sacked almost every single one of the senior operators in the field of Aboriginal affairs. Some courageous people have fought to get them back again, because they were the only decent people that they had in the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) earlier referred to the lovely meetings that they had in the Torres Strait. I wonder whether the honourable member for Leichhardt referred to the fact that the Queensland government, which he was lauding and praising here, has taken control of all the people's houses. This is very much at the heart of this particular bill. In my day some $30 million or $40 million&mdash;it might even have been $46 million in one year&mdash;was given to the Queensland government to expend on Aboriginal housing. Be it good judgment or not, we decided to instruct our officers to work at the behest and the direction of the local federal government housing cooperatives. It was handled under an Aboriginal affairs department and the officers took their directions from the elected housing cooperatives. It was not a good system but I could not find any better. This way the black people had control of the housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, the Queensland government has simply shifted in a most improper manner all of the money for that housing away from the black people themselves&mdash;the decisions were taken by the ACC and ICC council as far as the community areas in Queensland were concerned, which was about two-thirds of the housing in those days&mdash;and handed it over to what was called the Housing Commission but which is now called Q-Build. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members think that the black people will get a fair go out of that arrangement, all I can say is that I have had black people from, I think, seven out of the 12 major areas in my electorate come to me and complain bitterly about the disastrous consequences that will follow for these houses. They will not be repaired; they will not be maintained; and the people will be brutalised about the collection of rent. I do not mean that rents do not have to be collected. I think we had about three per cent of delinquent debts, if my memory serves me correctly, in Queensland. People paid so long as they knew that they had to pay. We found that there was not a problem with the payment of rents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, one cannot help but think that these councils and the people's ability to run their own affairs are being undermined by the race of do-gooders who are threatened because not only they will have no jobs if the black people stand on their own two feet, but also their very identity and the way they define themselves will vanish. That is far more serious to them. Some say that they are simply worried about losing their jobs. As was explained to me by Eric Law, there is a lot more to it than just a fear of losing their jobs. They are worried about losing their identity. They feel threatened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time I saw black people stand on their own two feet, show initiative and start to make decisions, I could physically see the do-gooders tighten with tension because they were seriously threatened. All I can say is that the observations made by the honourable member for Cowper in this chamber are deadly accurate. That is at the very heart of the failure of this government and other governments to be able to come to grips with the successful management of the affairs in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving on to the specifics&mdash;I think I should move on to the specifics here&mdash;one of the reasons that we did not have any audit problems was because we were deadly determined to ensure that we did not have any audit problems. </PARA>

I am quite proud to repeat the statement, which he laughed at, that we were quite determined to see that the audits were successful.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of the cheques had to be signed by two people. Not only were the cheques to be signed, but I laid down a memo&mdash;which I must admit was not carried out; if it had been, I do not think a single council would have been out of line in that final year&mdash;that there was to be a reference number on every single cheque so that when a cheque was written a box had to be filled in with a number. That number referred to an account file. If someone did not have an account and had to pay money out, a memo was notated that was referred to a council meeting. That particular disbursement had to be agreed to by the council itself at a subsequent meeting so that every single writing of a cheque by that council and disbursement of moneys would have to be justified in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down by the auditor. I think that that was almost a foolproof system because we had only four tiny councils in the Torres Strait&mdash;one of which, Stephens Island, had only 25 people on it, so we can dismiss that and say only three councils&mdash;out of 27 that were out of order, and two of them were island councils. </PARA>

But I, like so many of the first Australians, have my suspicions that deep in the dark heart of the so-called do-gooders there is a subliminal or at least a subconscious desire to see the people fail on the issue of  private ownership and self-management, as it has been called so often. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quote just how well the Torres Strait Islanders can run when the shackles that have been imposed upon them over the years have been removed. The Badu freezer was in two feet of water when I first visited Badu and I was shown the freezer. It had gone broke three times under a communal ownership arrangement foisted upon the community by the do-gooders and the federal government&mdash;which had been of both political persuasions, so I am not making a political point here. There it lay, in two feet of mud. Richard Bowie approached me and Getano Lui and said he wanted to take over the freezer. After much argument and fighting over a period of two or three months, I said, `All right, we will buy the freezer. We will give it to them on the basis of a loan from the federal government'. On that basis the federal government decided it was prepared to give the freezer to this partnership of Richard Bowie, Joe Nona and Jacky Ahmat. At that stage I think there were six fishing boats working out of Badu and the total income from fishing from the Torres Strait Islands was about $350,000. </PARA>

It had been paid $3.5 million, if my memory serves me correctly, in the previous 12 months. Give the blokes a fair go, give them the opportunity to run, give them the carrot and stick of private ownership, the same as every other Australian enjoys&mdash;the machinery that will work, instead of stupid communal ownership which has failed everywhere it has been tried in the entire world&mdash;and see what these people can achieve.

We put fishing freezers in each of the communities because the banks would not loan money. There was no other way for them to be funded and each of the communities had their own fishing freezer so that the community could go fishing and have somewhere to store their fish until the mother ships came in and picked it up. One day on Coconut Island one of the dinghies had just come in and its catch for the morning, after being out for two or three hours, was about $500 or $600 worth of fish.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus bill which makes wide ranging amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Privacy Act 1988 and the High Court of Australia Act 1979. I do not intend addressing all of the amendments proposed by this bill. My principal comments will relate to the significant amendments proposed to the Privacy Act in respect of representative complaints.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several clauses in this bill are directed at correcting drafting errors or omissions. The second reading speech euphemistically refers to these amendments as `merely technical or made as a result of other legislative amendments'. In fact, they have been necessitated by sloppy drafting resulting in this parliament's time being taken up with amendments that should never have been necessary. Drafting errors and unconstitutional legislation take up an inordinate amount of parliamentary time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 36 of the Racial Discrimination Act provides that the minister may appoint an acting race discrimination commissioner when the commissioner is absent from duty, absent from Australia or during a vacancy in that office. At present, the acting commissioner cannot continue so to act for more than 12 months. The bill removes this restriction, which is referred to in the explanatory memorandum as a `drafting error'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is referred to as a `drafting omission' in the explanatory memorandum is that which was contained in the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1992. That legislation substituted new provisions in the Sex Discrimination Act with respect to sexual harassment in connection with the workplace. It was always intended that these amendments would not affect the exemption contained in the act in relation to acts of workplace sexual harassment by an employee of a state or of an instrumentality of a state. However, the relevant section refers to section 28, which was repealed by the 1992 act. Thus, since the commencement of that act on 13 January 1993, the intended exemption has been totally inoperative and there has not been the intended exemption from workplace sexual harassment provisions for employees of a state or a state instrumentality. This bill restores that exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment has been made retrospective and will thus be taken to have commenced on the date on which the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1992 commenced. I do not know whether any complaints of workplace sexual harassment have been made against state employees since the commencement of the 1992 act. If such complaints have been lodged, the retrospective nature of this amendment will render them groundless. Citizens may have incurred expense in pursuing them because of this `drafting error'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further `drafting error' in the Sex Discrimination Act is amended by this bill with the renumbering of a subsection. New subsections were inserted in the Sex Discrimination Act by the Sex Discrimination Amendment Act 1991. Subsequently, a further subsection with the same number was inserted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Act 1992. These botched amendments have resulted in the reprinted Sex Discrimination Act presently containing two subsections 14(4). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the errors in drafting which this bill seeks to amend, it also proposes amending what amounts to an error in judgment on the part of the government in relation to exemptions in the Sex Discrimination Act with respect to particular insurance policies and superannuation funds. The Sex Discrimination Amendment Act 1991 removed from the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 the exemption for superannuation and insurance policies and replaced them with more limited exemptions. These provisions were to have commenced on 25 June 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the second reading speech, the delay in the commencement of these provisions was in order to give superannuation funds time to develop options to allow members to transfer to non-discriminatory schemes. However, the guidelines which were to be formulated by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to assist funds to develop non-discriminatory options were not finalised in sufficient time. As a result, clause 24 of this bill provides that these new provisions shall be taken to have commenced on 1 July 1994 to allow time for the funds to be in a position to comply with the new regime. Clearly, the introduction of these provisions was premature and without adequate consultation with the parties concerned. We will await with bated breath the extension of the date to 1 July 1994 to see whether that also introduces a premature arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst critical of the fact that sloppy drafting and inadequate consultation on the part of the government have necessitated the amendments just described, the opposition does not oppose those provisions in this bill. Nor does it oppose the other amendments contained in the bill in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Disability Discrimination Act and the High Court of Australia Act. The opposition also does not oppose the proposed amendments to the Privacy Act which provide for the registration of determinations made under that act in the Federal Court, their review and enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is noted that these provisions, and similar provisions already contained in the Disability Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act may fall foul of the constitution with respect to the separation of judicial and non-judicial power. However, the opposition recognises that these procedures provide a more straightforward method of enforcement and review than those presently contained in the Privacy Act. Consistent with its position with respect to the other legislation mentioned, the opposition will not oppose these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now come to the amendments proposed by this bill which the opposition does oppose. Amendments have been circulated in my name, which I will move. Under the Privacy Act, where an act or practice may interfere with the privacy of two or more individuals, any one of those individuals may make a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner. This is presently defined as a `representative complaint'. This bill proposes modifying the definitions and procedures relating to representative or class complaints in the Privacy Act along the lines of corresponding provisions relating to representative actions under the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976. Similar amendments were made to the Disability Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act by the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section 39 of the Privacy Act, nothing in the provisions relating to representative complaints prevents a person from making a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner about an act or practice about which a representative complaint has been made. The proposed amendment will provide that a person who is a class member in a representative action is prevented from lodging an individual complaint unless that person withdraws from the representative complaint. Thus, the bill seeks to incorporate an `opt out' rather than an `opt in' system with respect to representative actions. In other words, unless a member of the class which is covered by the representative complaint withdraws from the action, his or her rights are determined by that action without his or her voice ever having been heard. Such a scheme has never been supported by the opposition and it is not supported in relation to this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of a person being included in a class on the description of a complainant and thereby having his or her rights determined in that action, unless he or she specifically withdraws from it, is offensive to the notion of justice. In this regard, I refer to the submission made to the government by the Law Council of Australia when similar amendments were proposed to the Federal Court of Australia Act. As stated in the Law Council's letter to the then Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Michael Tate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a person should be bound by the outcome of a representative action only if he or she gives express consent to be bound. A procedure which places the onus on the individual to opt out of a proceeding does not provide appropriate or adequate protection to individuals who may not wish to be bound by the outcome of a representative action. </PARA>
<PARA>The Law Council also pointed out that there is a risk that a representative action taken in a new field will fail, leaving all members of the group unable to take their own separate action if they wish to do so. I concur with the comment of the Law Council that members of that group should not have to run that risk unless they agree to accept it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this bill was debated in the Senate last month, Senator Bolkus's response to the opposition's concerns about the representative complaint amendments was simply to say that the debate as to whether there should be opt-in or opt-out provisions had been debated in the past and that the debate had `lost its vitality'. Whilst the debate may have lost its vitality for Senator Bolkus, it has not for the opposition. The fact that the government was successful in amending other legislation to incorporate similar provisions does not render the present amendments either correct or desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus also used a quite illogical piece of reasoning to justify the provisions. He said that legal access to redress of rights, particularly for those who are disadvantaged and less educated, was more likely to come through an opt-out proposal which, at the same time, according to the senator, would enhance the access to justice of many. In fact, it is precisely those disadvantaged and less educated people who will be adversely affected by the proposed amendments&mdash;those who will not be aware that their rights may finally be determined in a representative action unless they opt out of it. The fundamental point is that, with opt-in provisions, individual rights are not lost if an individual is unaware of or takes no action with respect to a representative action. It is essentially irrelevant whether those rights are exercised or not. In contrast with opt-out provisions, an individual must be aware of and take steps to withdraw from a representative complaint to prevent his or her rights being lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of access to justice is one which must be addressed separately and does not, in any way, mitigate the  fact that opt-out provisions can result in individual rights being lost without those individuals ever being aware of those rights in the first place. The fact is that the provisions proposed by this bill with respect to representative complaints are unjust. The amendments I have proposed will result in the omission of the amending provisions. I commend the amendments. The bill is otherwise not opposed by the opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill, but I am not in a position to support the amendments proposed by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). It is the government's view that providing an opt-out provision allows for greater access to justice for people&mdash;it will certainly not take away their rights&mdash;and it has been incorporated in other legislation in this area, including state legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the bill more generally. As the shadow Attorney-General indicated, this is a portfolio bill which provides a number of technical amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Racial Discrimination Act. These acts were amended late last year under the Sex Discrimination and other Legislation Amendment Act 1992 which provided for the enforcement of determinations by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission via their registration in the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous amendment required that the respondent receive written notification within seven days and that the respondent be allowed 28 days from the registration to appeal  the commission's decision in the Federal Court. Absence of an application to review the decision within that time span would automatically result in the determination becoming an order of the court at the expiration of the 28-day period. Subsequently, concern was expressed by the Chief Justice of the Federal Court that this time limit could lead to injustice in certain circumstances. Therefore, the amendments in the bill under consideration this evening allow the court to review a determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission after the 28-day period has elapsed if the court considers that there are exceptional circumstances. The Federal Court has approved these amendments as drafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The onus will be on the respondent to demonstrate that exceptional circumstances have occurred. The possibility of a review outside the 28-day period will not prevent the complainant from taking action to enforce the determination after the 28 days from the registration of that determination. In this way, both the original complainant and the respondent are not denied access to due process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Privacy Act include, firstly, the amendment to the determination provisions of the Privacy Act. The amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act were part of the government's response to the recommendations made by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Halfway to equal</EMPHASIS>, but did not incorporate the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in its review of decisions of the human rights and equal opportunities commissioners and the Privacy Commissioner. Consequently, the amendments to the Privacy Act will make it consistent with the enforcement of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission determinations, including the extension of time for review in exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect is the clarification of the power of the Privacy Commissioner to copy and retain documents. Amendments will provide the Privacy Commissioner with specific authority to copy and retain documents relevant to an inquiry, as is the case for the Ombudsman and the human rights commissioners. The third aspect relates to compensation for humiliation and injury to feelings. The Crimes Act 1914&mdash;in relation to spent convictions&mdash;the Privacy Act, the SDA, the RDA and the DDA give the authority investigating complaints the power to make determinations on those complaints. This amendment will allow for the inclusion of injury to the complainant's feelings or humiliation suffered by the complainant to be specifically compensated for under the Privacy Act which, once again, brings this act into line with other discrimination acts under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The technical amendment simply amends the reference to the Joint Intelligence Organisation updating it to the Defence Intelligence Organisation. A further amendment also provides for disclosures of credit information to state and territory government housing assistance schemes. This amendment will assist state and territory mortgage assistance schemes to be supervised and managed adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to the Racial Discrimination Act is an  amendment of a technical error identified by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in section 36 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Amendment Act. In referring to these technical drafting errors, I note that the shadow Attorney-General made much out of these technical problems. I dare say that, in a perfect world, these things would not happen. But this is far from a perfect world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent conduct of legislation due to the pressure put on the parliamentary draftspeople by the requirement to have bills in the other place by a certain date has caused several more technical drafting errors. So the shadow Attorney-General is being a little precious in taking the high moral ground on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act, the shadow Attorney-General also referred to the exemption of employees of state governments and state instrumentalities. It should be noted that all states, with the exception of Tasmania, have complementary legislation. Although the shadow Attorney-General expressed concern about what has happened, as far as I am aware, the cases he alludes to have not made the headlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Attorney-General also referred to the superannuation amendments in the Sex Discrimination Act. The time allotted for the changeover to a new regime for non-discrimination in superannuation as provided for in the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1991 is to be extended. Originally, as indicated by my colleague opposite, it was planned that this would be in place by June of this year but, due to administrative difficulties, has been delayed until 1 July 1994. Unless the Sex Discrimination Act is amended to allow fund administrators to continue to offer existing members time to join non-discriminatory schemes prior to the removal of the blanket exemption, superannuation funds will find themselves in violation of the Sex Discrimination Act. Such matters are required in a world that is far from perfect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to the High Court of Australia Act is obviously technical, to amalgamate the office and responsibilities of the clerk of the court and the registrar into the chief executive and principal registrar. All of these amendments are designed to make these various acts work effectively together and to provide security and access to important areas of discrimination and equal rights legislation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spend some time reminding the House why these amendments are so necessary. It is a great tribute to the Labor governments in this country that we are dealing with such legislation. It is important that honourable members remind themselves that these amendments are important because every day in Australia people suffer discrimination. The legislation provides for conciliation and processes to enforce determinations, thus sending a strong signal to individuals, employers and groups in the community that discrimination on the grounds of race, sex or disability is no longer acceptable in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to give the House some illustrations of discrimination from my own professional experience. I recall attending a dinner with management and executives of a state government instrumentality&mdash;people whose managerial competence I had a great deal of admiration for. At that dinner they criticised the sex discrimination legislation, suggesting that it really was no longer necessary because there was no sex discrimination in the workplace&mdash;not on their behalf anyway! A lively discussion ensued and, being the only woman&mdash;the first woman on the board of this statutory authority&mdash;I lobbed shots across the dinner table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember that every day in most workplaces women have to deal with discriminatory practices. I have been in the work force since I was 12, so I have had a few discriminatory experiences. The stories I have heard from women in the work force indicate the real importance of this legislation. These experiences have impacted not only on the way people did their work but on their life experiences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the young girl who was subjected to continual harassment at her workplace, which culminated in her employer demanding oral sex from her. This young girl was very vulnerable, having already experienced other forms of sexual abuse away from the workplace in her family of origin. That experience led her to leave that job in which she was gaining confidence, and affected her choice of partner. It was not until she had counselling to deal with the trauma of those experiences that she began to make more effective choices in other aspects of her life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the very competently qualified female engineer who was put in a position of authority over a number of male colleagues and had to work away from the city. In the course of that work, following a period of socialising, she was drugged, violently attacked and, effectively, raped. When she attempted to seek redress through her senior people, the boys closed ranks and she was made to feel the guilty party. She was unable to obtain redress, which caused her to leave the field of work in which she was extremely competent. She had to carry that burden completely unresolved until further situations in her work brought her into contact with counselling, where she was able to deal with these kinds of experiences. As a counsellor who spent a lot of time dealing with clients who suffered just about every form of sexual harassment and abuse, I felt extremely angry about that girl's situation because her career was completely destroyed by that experience. We have to remind ourselves that, even with legislation in place, it is not always easy for people to seek redress in law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can think of another example of a young woman at university. I was told this story by a nephew of this young woman who attended the same engineering course. This goes back 10 years when there were not so many young women doing a first year engineering degree at a well-known university in my state. One day this young woman walked into the lecture theatre, and written on the board by her male peers was the line, `Would Joan Smith'&mdash;not her real name&mdash;`please wear a bra and shave her legs'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This incident was related to me with much mirth but it resulted in that young student withdrawing from that engineering course. I do not know what she is doing now, but we have probably lost a very competent engineering professional because the boys could not handle the fact that she was a female who did not conform to their stereotype of what a female engineering student should be like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to tell honourable members about women who are out of the work force who find, even today, when they breastfeed their babies in public, that they are subject to threats, hostility and harassment. I thought that only happened years ago, at a time when I was breastfeeding my babies in public and was subjected to that kind of thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent incident occurred in Western Australia when a young mother was ordered off a bus for doing the most natural thing in the world&mdash;in fact, the activity which has nurtured the human race. Being mammals we suckle our young, and that has probably got most of us&mdash;including the shadow Attorney-General&mdash;where we are today. The fact that such things still happen in our community indicates that we have a great deal more to do. Not only must we have this legislation, but we must educate people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was recently at a mine site for a professional meeting with senior management regarding a person who had been injured at work. Prior to the meeting being opened, one of my male colleagues indicated the calendar on the wall and said, `Well, where is the bottom half of it?'. This comment was addressed to a senior management person at a major coal production facility in the Bowen Basin. When I tentatively expressed my concern about calendars on the work site which were inappropriate in these days, I was accosted with the comment, `Well, this is the way it is. You can't do anything any more. You can't put your hand on a woman. You</PARA>
<PARA>can't call them "love" or anything'. This sort of response when women challenge sexist material in a workplace is still very widespread. The fact that young male students are still being `greased' on work experience and accept that it is okay, and the fact that they are still unaware that they are harassing their peers in high school until it is drawn to their attention, indicates that we have a very long way to go when it comes to dealing with discrimination in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not have the sort of excellent legislation that is the proud record of this government, and if we do not continue to make the important technical amendments that will allow access to effective justice in these areas, we will continue to have discrimination on the basis of sex, race and disability. That is not acceptable in 1993, and we must continue to work very hard to deal with this issue. I commend the legislation to the House and oppose the amendment from the opposition. </PARA>

There is not an adequate opportunity to consider individual items. The imposition of the guillotine has often meant that we do not have an adequate committee stage; consequently, various clauses are not subjected to the scrutiny they should be.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does concern me that in Australia we have a situation where the High Court has decided, through judicial interpretation, that the federal government can now enter into a treaty with virtually any nation anywhere in the world and thereby acquire the domestic competence to legislate, even though under our Australian federal constitution the matter which is the subject of such legislation would normally be a matter of state responsibility. So the High Court judges, I suppose, have torn up the constitution as we knew it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an ongoing problem, and it will probably remain so until we have a constitutional amendment in relation to the external affairs power. However, given the difficulty that governments of both political persuasions have had in changing the constitution through this mechanism, it is a problem that will probably endure. The Disability Discrimination Act was brought into being partly because of Australia's obligations under a number of UN instruments, including the ILO convention on discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. That is one of the bills which became law through the fairly generous interpretation of the provisions in the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular act puts certain procedures in place, but unfortunately those procedures could well be flawed constitutionally. The 1992 legislation created difficulties which unfortunately have not yet been resolved, and are not resolved by this legislation. The 1992 legislation effectively allowed the commission's determinations to have the same effect as a Federal Court order. Therefore, the commission is allowed to make binding judicial orders, and this provision is believed to breach the constitutional separation of powers. Under the earlier legislation, while the commission was able to make orders, the orders were not binding. As such, that was not seen to be a breach of the constitutional separation of powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government really stands condemned for failing to take the opportunity to rectify this particular matter by this omnibus bill. Generally speaking, I am opposed to the sorts of omnibus bills we have had but, if we are to have them, we really should take the opportunity to rectify matters which clearly require rectification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we do not oppose the extension of the time limit&mdash;currently 28 days; in effect, 21 days&mdash;during which a respondent is able to appeal to the Federal Court to review a determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I think it is only reasonable that this discretion should be given to the Federal Court in exceptional circumstances to enable a person aggrieved by a decision of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to apply for a review. I might add that this omnibus bill includes similar provisions for the extension of the time limit of 28 days pursuant to the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also say that I have some concerns about the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Those of us who read the newspapers&mdash;members of parliament probably read more newspapers than most people&mdash;have found that many people have been upset by decisions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. At times that commission has appeared to be a kangaroo court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personally, I think that if a person is alleged to have breached a law of this country that person ought to have access to the ordinary courts of the land. In this I am consistent with my approach to industrial relations where I believe that industrial relations and the question of damages flowing from unlawful industrial action should be dealt with in the ordinary courts of the land rather than in special courts&mdash;which of course is the government's policy. Special courts lead one to the suspicion that there are special rules for special people and that there are deals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Privacy Act there are some new provisions, clauses 10 to 13, which include new procedures for the making of and dealing with representative complaints similar to those available under the Disability Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act. Clause 11 sets out the conditions to be satisfied before a representative complaint may be lodged. These conditions include the fact that class members must have a complaint against the same person, all complaints must arise out of the same, similar or related circumstances and that all complaints give rise to a substantial common issue of law or fact. Proposed subsection 38(3) provides that a representative complaint may be lodged without the consent of a class member, and the system of representative actions proposed by the bill is an opt-out system. We on this side of the House believe that an opt-in system would be much better, because it is quite wrong that a person could be deemed to be involved. A person really should make the decision to be part of the action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). Mention has been made by my colleague the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) of the Sex Discrimination Act. In any reasonable society, no honourable member in this parliament would support discrimination on the basis of gender or on any other basis. However, while the cases outlined by the honourable member were in some instances very unsavoury and very unsatisfactory, at times I think that people can go a little overboard. After all, the honourable member for Capricornia is here in this place performing an equal role with her male and female colleagues, and that is exactly the way it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been opposed to affirmative action legislation because quite often I think it can be demeaning to women if the token woman is put in. We need the right people for the job, whether people happen to be male or female. The paramount consideration for appointment to any position must be that of merit and not of gender. I stress that I am totally in favour of equal opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that we are discussing changes the date for the application of provisions relating to making superannuation funds non-discriminatory. The provisions in the bill to that effect are fairly unexceptional. The reason for the extension to the time given under the original legislation was that the superannuation funds needed a longer period to put options before members so that the non-discriminatory intention of the original act could be brought in in an orderly way, and one would not oppose that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a grab-bag of provisions. It is almost as though someone in the minister's department sat down and said, `We found this mistake and we found that fault, and we found that a particular draftsman did not possibly dot his or her i's and cross his or her t's as would be required', with the result that we have legislation that is ineffective or somewhat flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read the speech made by my colleague Senator Vanstone who, I thought, was extraordinarily generous to public servants. She, quite reasonably, put most of the blame in the direction of the government for mistakes in drafting because of the way the government runs the program of the parliament. She said that the government does not give adequate time to draftsmen to enable them to bring forward legislation of the sort that we really need without the faults and defects that unfortunately are now so common. But I think it is not unreasonable for the government to approach the drafting agency and say that the mistakes that have been creeping into the legislation are not acceptable, and I think those officers ought to look at their own practices. The government should be coming forward with some definitive answers for us as parliamentarians as to why these mistakes are occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is not opposing the substance of most of the provisions of the bill. The honourable member for Tangney has proposed certain amendments and I support them. I certainly hope that the government will consider adopting them because I feel that, unless the government is more reasonable in this place and seriously considers amendments that we seek to make to its legislation, we will have more omnibus bills having to correct more mistakes. If we have a reasonable opportunity for debate, if the government allows the parliament to look at its legislation clause by clause, then a lot of the mistakes which now have to be rectified would not be made in the first place. </PARA>

Before doing so, I thank all members that have contributed to this debate, particularly, in his usual thoughtful way, the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). I also want to say how pleased I was to listen to the contribution of the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) who, in his reincarnated guise, is certainly a calmer parliamentary animal than the one we used to see some little time ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset I want to deal with the point that the honourable member for Fisher made before he concluded because I thought it was somewhat disingenuous. The amendments that have been proposed by the honourable member for Tangney contain what I call a philosophical position. They are in no way related to mistakes or omissions or any other problems with legislation that has gone through this parliament. So to suggest that the reason that these amendments have to be moved is that at some time in the past mistakes have been made because legislation has been rushed through the parliament, or some other such suggestion, is completely false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general thrust of some of the comments that were made by opposition speakers on this omnibus bill was that it repairs either mistakes that have been made or drafting errors which have been ascertained because of legal advice or possibly in some cases because of court decisions. It is a bit disingenuous of the opposition to be crying crocodile tears about these sorts of matters. I can say from my long experience in this place and in the South Australian parliament, both in opposition and in government&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am particularly delighted, if I can respond to that, that I am not there now. The point is that these mistakes do happen. At one time members actually used to draft their own pieces of legislation. I do not think that we need to be any great students of history to know that it got to the stage where some of the pieces of legislation were so dreadfully drafted that they did not achieve anything like what was desirable or intended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little time later we then had the period where members relied heavily on the good offices of the clerks of the parliament for drafting advice. Again, it was found after some time that that was not entirely appropriate. The position that was originally called parliamentary draftsman&mdash;now known, in this place anyway, as parliamentary counsel&mdash;came to the fore. For many years now legislation has been specially drafted by such people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But these experts in this area of parliamentary or legislative drafting are not perfectionists. They are not absolutely perfect, of course. They are human like the rest of us. With the best will, intention and care, inevitably mistakes will be made. Sometimes they are not mistakes of the parliamentary counsel's office. Not infrequently mistakes which need to be corrected are made in the printing and production processes as well. Then of course there are changes which are necessary as a result of statutory interpretation by the courts. These things are perfectly normal. They are not out of the ordinary. Each and every one of us know that that is the case. As long as there is a parliament&mdash;I hope that will be for a very long time&mdash;there will be situations where an omnibus bill, as it is so called, is needed to correct and adjust in a minor way statutory instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the brief few minutes available to me, I want to deal with the main issues which were raised. Firstly, I refer to the issue of so-called separation of powers. I noticed that this was raised by some senators and was raised again tonight by the honourable member for Fisher. I want to make the point that nothing in this bill before the parliament will be struck down as being in breach of the separation of powers doctrine. Upon review, the Federal Court could review all issues of fact and law. The respondent would be able to adduce new evidence but only with the leave of the court. The court would have full control of the disposition of the matter where a respondent had chosen to contest the determination of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme is basically analogous to the procedures concerning judgments in default of appearance or defence in an ordinary civil court. In principle, there is no relevant distinction between these procedures and the main features of the proposed provisions. In other words, although a determination will be made by the tribunal, its determination cannot be enforced therein. It must be registered in the Federal Court. As I said a couple of moments ago, that will then enable the Federal Court, after reviewing the determination, to enforce it once the Federal Court has adopted it. So I reject the suggestion that there is a breach in any way of the doctrine of the separation of powers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, I believe that this legislation does not affect any breach of the separation of powers doctrine. We are dealing with this particular piece of legislation and, as such, I do not think the points that were made in the Senate or here tonight are valid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to deal with the so-called issue of opting in or opting out. I think it can be said that this is an important philosophical issue between the opposition and the government. We believe that, if there is to be class actions&mdash;over a period class actions have become more and more available in this country; personally, I think that is a step in the right direction and that class actions should have been made more readily available in this country long ago&mdash;we must choose to have either what is known as an opting-in or an opting-out procedure. In other words, where an action is to be taken by a person on behalf of a class of persons, there should either be a procedure whereby the person taking the action ropes in as many persons of the class with their knowledge and consent as he or she could contact or, alternatively, we should have a procedure where the person taking the action does so on behalf of all the people in the class&mdash;known or otherwise&mdash;and those people then, by various procedures, are able to opt out should they want to and take their own proceedings if they choose to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of those choices that one often has to make in law or legislation which is superficially difficult because of arguments in favour of each side. But, overwhelmingly, the strength of the arguments is in favour of the arrangements which are known as opting out because that procedure is the best option to ensure that the rights of the class are not abrogated, are not extinguished and are assisted. That option is particularly useful in terms of equity because there are many people in classes. When we are dealing with the privacy laws, quite clearly it would be very unfair if there were, for example, to be an unlawful disclosure of a list of names and only some of those people were able to be included in the class simply because they were too poor to take action on their own or were not able to take action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allegations of interferences with privacy may lead to the conclusion that not only the complainant but all members of the class have been affected by the act or practice. All of those people ought to be able to be part of that action unless they specifically wish to opt out. I say to the House that I believe that the government is wholly right on this matter. As I have said, the government believes that it is right on the grounds of both equity and efficiency. In my view, opting out will allow more Australians to assert their rights and that should be the principle by which this parliament approaches this sort of question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I think that opting-in procedures are not a practical alternative because they are obviously unworkable where there are large numbers of complainants. Opting-in procedures disadvantage the poor and the less well educated. As a policy we ought to try to assist the poor and those less able to look after themselves. That is certainly what an opt-out procedure allows to happen. An opt-out inquiry will inevitably be simpler and cheaper to run than cases involving large numbers of named and identified complainants. This system basically works in the United States at the federal level. It has worked there for a long period and has been found to be effective. I think the efficacy of it is now beyond question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of court proceedings, the manifest inadequacies of an opt-in approach have already been recognised by the courts through the development of the representative actions procedure, which I think now exists in most of the supreme courts around the nation.

There has been very serious violence on the picket line both yesterday and, to a lesser extent, today. I am extremely disturbed at the fact that this is occurring in my electorate and that the approach now being taken by the police resembles that which was taken in demonstrations back in perhaps the late 1960s and early 1970s, but which, under both Liberal and Labor governments since then, had become much more moderate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I refer to the use of batons by the police yesterday. They were lining up and chanting at demonstrators and attacking them with batons. Fortunately, that behaviour seems to have moderated a bit today, but I am still extremely disturbed by the developments. I am particularly worried that we are now seeing a return to a much more confrontationist approach by police in their dealings with picket lines and demonstrators. As I indicated, it is a return to the sort of approach that led to very serious violence in demonstrations in the early 1970s&mdash;for example, the Springbok tour demonstrations. </PARA>

In fact, I was intending to refer not to individuals with respect to charges but to the fact that the state government has made a political attack, indicating that there is something wrong with the cause involved because of individuals who happen to have associated themselves with that cause. I am very aware of the fact that reflecting on particular matters likely to come before the judicial system is not appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What worries me is that in some way the state government seeks to discredit the cause, which is a very worthwhile cause&mdash;that is, maintaining co-educational public education in the suburb of Richmond.

Until recently, she was a councillor with the Richmond City Council and has been active in the Richmond area for a good number of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Richmond City Council, which recently indicated that it felt that the protesters should give way to the decision of the state government, has now passed a resolution condemning the violence that has occurred.

The time frame of the operation of the courts in effect denies justice and, given the number of acquittals, either many guilty persons go free or the authorities charge many innocent people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is no greater condemnation of our legal system than the struggle for justice over 13 years by Leszek Rajski. This notorious litigation began in 1980 with a breach of contract action brought by a company called Tectran against Rajski and his company Raybos, leading to a number of subsequent actions. Rajski has sued a number of associated companies: Tectran, Scitec and Gavemer Properties. He is also suing their directors and solicitors on the grounds of conspiracy and abuse of process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The web of intrigue and manoeuvres since 1980 has not only brought into question the integrity of legal firms such as Allen Allen and Hemsley and Blake Dawson Waldron, but also the effectiveness of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, the Australian Stock Exchange and the Australian Securities Commission. These huge and powerful legal firms have for years manipulated the processes of the Supreme Court and have prevented the fair resolution of the Tectran v Raybos litigation. Their manipulation has prevented justice being done between the weak and powerful and prevented the exposure of those law firms' perversion of the justice process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also brought into disrepute the court which has allowed it to happen. The failure of the court to deal expeditiously with this case is having national ramifications. Encouraged by that failure, one of the parties has been emboldened to engage in a persistent and dangerous deception affecting the investing public and the integrity of the institutions supposed to protect the investing public&mdash;the Australian Stock Exchange and the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July 1993, the New South Wales Court of Appeal finally made clear that Rajski's conspiracy and abuse of process allegations should be heard at the same time as the Tectran v Raybos breach of contract action. This action, he alleges, was a fraudulent concoction by Tectran and its original lawyers, Allen Allen and Hemsley, and maintained by its later lawyers, Blake Dawson Waldron. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no accident that, since the judgment of the court of appeal opened the way to a proper hearing of Rajski's allegations, Allen Allen and Hemsley have moved to negotiate a settlement of Rajski's claim&mdash;after 13 years. However, ultimately Rajski's claim is against the Tectran interests. Tectran and the old Scitec are now nothing more than a shell. To secure his position, in 1987 Rajski began proceedings in the Supreme Court against their successors. These proceedings are very much alive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has this got to do with the Australian Stock Exchange and the Australian Securities Commission? Scitec Communication Systems Ltd is listed on the Stock Exchange, and under Stock Exchange rules potential liability should be disclosed in annual reports. It should do that in its latest prospectus by which it is currently seeking to raise large sums from the investing public, particularly as the potential liability runs into millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the manoeuvres and delays have kept Rajski and Scitec out of court, he does have a judgment that a prima facie case exists against the Tectran interest and its lawyers. Scitec either does not acknowledge the existence of this potential liability, or denies that it is `material' within the meaning of the Companies Code. The somewhat vague and commercial provision of the Companies Code is being used as a loophole to refuse to disclose information which investors need if they are to be properly informed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless the Australian Securities Commission has queried Scitec's failure to disclose in its annual returns the serious contingency liability it carries because of its involvement in this litigation. In response, Scitec has told the commission that it has legal advice that the contingency liability litigation is not `material' and therefore need not be reported in its annual report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But can there really be any public confidence in the commission giving a dispassionate judgment when its chairman is a senior partner in one of the legal firms being sued? This case highlights the question of the appropriateness of appointing practising professionals to the Australian Securities Commission from areas which the commission is supposed to supervise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, tonight I would like to bring to the attention of the House, and also put on record my support for, a local export project that looks likely to make a significant impact on local industry on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. The project I refer to was undertaken by the New South Wales Forest Products Association and is titled `Market Opportunities on the West Coast of the USA for Flooring Milled from NSW Hardwoods'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I attended the launch of this project at Cassegrains winery at Port Macquarie, and I was pleased to see the widespread support from the community that this project received. It was also pleasing to see the honourable member for Patterson (Mr Horne) attending the opening and putting his support behind this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project has been principally funded by the mid-north coast Office of Labour Market Adjustment, and I congratulate  that office for its contribution to the project. It is more projects such as this that will generate truly practical solutions to the employment problems on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. It should be pointed out that these projects have been successfully running for some time without any jobs levy of any kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three representatives of the New South Wales hardwood sawmilling industry played an integral role in the formation of the report. These people were Doug Head of Kempsey Timbers, David Prestwidge from the New South Wales Forest Products Association, and Richard Sims, manager of Upper Hunter River Timbers. These three people deserve congratulations for their practical and realistic initiatives towards the export of hardwoods to the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have examined the report and it is very well compiled. It provides a comprehensive overview of the US hardwood flooring market, including an analysis of its size, growth, structure and value. The report also covers issues such as distribution regulation, environmental considerations, technical requirements, and promotion and marketing, and relates all of these elements back to the potential for the New South Wales manufactured product. The report includes recommendations pertaining to manufacturing guidelines, packaging, labelling, documentation, transportation and distribution of exported hardwood to satisfy US regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main issue to come from the report is that US hardwood markets are immediately viable, and that other markets such as Europe and Asia are at least as effective. The research has revealed a market worth a massive $A750 million per annum in the US for solid strip hardwood flooring, forecast to grow to possibly twice this size by the turn of the century. This is a great opportunity for hardwood millers on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. As the report itself concludes, there are genuine and viable opportunities for New South Wales hardwood millers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the project team's visit to several US east coast sawmilling and manufacturing operations, it became clear that they are faced with many of the same problems that are experienced in New South Wales hardwood mills. For example, maximising recovery of saleable product from low-grade logs and the profitable utilisation of short length and/or low-grade material poses the same challenges to the US as it does here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to these problems, the US has developed and educated markets to suit the material. As a consequence, US sawmillers are engaging in a high level of further processing to add value to a traditionally low value product. Australian sawmillers could significantly benefit from such a strategy, given the current underutilisation of short length material on the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of comparison, in the US, lumber will not leave the local town until all possible dollars have been squeezed out of it. In Australia, the timber is cut down and more often than not sent in its raw form, and that is the last we see of it. From an employment point of view the comparison is startling. For the same volume of timber in both countries, the US employs 10 times as many people as Australia. This includes a diverse cross-section of jobs including quality assurance, grading and classifying, exporting, design and marketing, and trade, as well as the traditional labouring jobs. In Australia, this cross-section of industry employment is not nearly as well developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a lesson not only for the timber industry, but for the rural community in general. There needs to be an increase in the level of local manufacturing and processing of our raw materials, together with further development of local value-adding facilities. This will not only increase rural and regional employment prospects, but will also improve the economic outlook of regional New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome this project as an extremely thorough and practical insight into the opportunities available for exports to the USA. Too often we on this side of the House are critical. However, this evening I congratulate all involved in this project, and I look forward to seeing more products of a similar nature that will help industry on the mid north coast develop to its full potential. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The birds of carrion are flying around the skies of North Queensland. The vultures are circling. Jaquita closes in on the banana industry, Tate and Lyle closes in on the sugar industry and Conagra closes in on the giant beef industry of Australia. Each of these companies is an international commodities broker of giant size and has predatory practices as part of its modus operandi in all of its operations throughout the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bundaberg Sugar Company, a subsidiary of Tate and Lyle, through its subsidiary BNQ, has contemptuously made a takeover bid for both Tully and South Johnstone mills. This intention was made known on 18 October. The bid is most unwelcome and completely undervalues the shares in both milling organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It behoves me to put on the record this evening the rather brilliant front cover of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tully Times</EMPHASIS> in which an assessment of this bid is made. I do not have the time to read out that article this evening, although I do pay tribute to the editor of the newspaper, Bruce Dickson, for the intense work that he has done in most successfully exposing the undervaluation of these shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tate and Lyle took over the Bundaberg Sugar Company in 1991. Since that time the performance of the six sugar mills&mdash;three of which are in Bundaberg, one in Nambour, one in Innisfail and one in Babinda&mdash;has deteriorated markedly to the extent where the mills have been subject to continuous breakdowns and delays to crushing operations, thus incurring losses to the growers supplying those mills. The dismal problems have put at risk the crushing of all of the cane at Babinda, Nambour and the Bundaberg mills. There has been some wet weather effect in these areas, but of higher importance are the delays from breakdown and processing problems. I must emphasise that I am not in any way criticising the workers in any of these mills. This is just a failure to outlay the necessary funds and bring in the maintenance people who need to be brought in on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, Babinda and Mourilyan mills have had serious accidents which have caused Division of Workplace Health and Safety representatives to closely examine safety operations of the two mills under the terms of the Workplace Health and Safety Act. In a recent case, it is tragic to report that an employee of Babinda mill who was cleaning in the area of the milling unit fell through an open walkway and his leg was drawn into the crushing rollers of the milling unit. He, of course, lost his leg. This sort of accident is almost without precedence in sugar mills; they were until recently extremely safe places of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a similar unreported incident at Babinda which could have resulted in similar circumstances. The week prior to the unfortunate incident with the man's leg, Queensland Rail's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunlander</EMPHASIS> ran into a cane train crossing the Queensland railway into Babinda mill. Fortunately, nobody was injured in this incident, but once again this highlights the manner in which panic, induced by poor management of crushing operations to complete the 1993 crushing by this mill, has caused the failure of application of normal safety procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within two to three days of the unfortunate incident at Babinda where a man lost his leg, two employees of Mourilyan mill were burnt with hot juice flowing from a conduit in the factory. This clearly demonstrates again that workplace health and safety matters need to be very closely examined in mills owned by Tate and Lyle. The delays to the crushing at Babinda mill will cause significant losses to Babinda growers, and the fact that approximately 100,000 tonnes of cane will be left to rot in the fields supplying the Moreton mill at Nambour must be of grave concern to the cane growing community. The Bundaberg area is currently being subjected to industrial action over the failure of an enterprise bargaining agreement, which will cause further delays to the termination of the crushing season and possibly cause cane to be left in the fields there as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that the performance of all Tate and Lyle mills in Australia has deteriorated significantly since that company took over Bundaberg Sugar. To this effect, five of the seven mills still crushing cane in Queensland belong to Bundaberg Sugar. Other mills with larger quantities of cane crushed have completed their crushing seasons over the last three weeks and have been subject to similar lost time through wet weather. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these mills are grower owned and crushed record tonnages of cane. Two of these mills are South Johnstone and Tully, the subject of the current takeover bids. In 1993 Tully mill crushed a record of almost 1.6 million tonnes and South Johnstone crushed a record of almost 1.1 million tonnes, in periods which are proven to be economic crushing season lengths for cane growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both South Johnstone and Tully are extremely well managed, highly efficient mills and are essentially free of industrial troubles. Their operations are controlled by boards of directors who are themselves cane farmers. The high level of operating efficiency of these two mills has been the result of balanced fiscal decisions relating to allocation of maintenance and capital expenditure. Both mills are producing high quality sugar which is sought after in world markets. Both mills are modern, high capacity units incorporating modern technology and operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of concern that Tate and Lyle now wishes to take over two mills, and growers in these areas run the risk of having the current highly efficient units being progressively reduced to the standard of operations of the six Bundaberg mills. Surely a move which will reduce two top performing mills to a mediocre organisation must be a detriment to Australia. It is quite apparent that, whilst Tate and Lyle executives may be experts in other areas of the sugar world, their expertise and management and ability to operate raw sugar mills is grossly deficient. Why should this purchase continue which will ultimately result in a further two mills being reduced in efficiency?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tate and Lyle's intention to extend its sugar industry in Australia means that other mills which are also operating efficiently will fall into the low performance category. South Johnstone mill, for instance, has spent $30 million in capital expenditure over the last 14 years and increased its crushing rate from approximately 380 tonnes per hour to a capability which will allow 500 tonnes per hour. This capital expenditure was used to improve milling capacity, sugar quality and recovery aspects and additionally reduce lost crushing time to the extent where in 1993 South Johnstone mill achieved lost time, excluding weather, of 3.3 per cent. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. Under the new sales tax law, vehicles purchased or supplied for community policing work can still qualify for exemption provided the use of the vehicles is for at least two years or 40,000 kilometres of running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old sales tax law did not specify how long goods had to be used in order to qualify for exemption. The administrative arrangement in operation, however, specified that vehicles had to be used for the exempt purpose for a period of two years or 40 000 kilometres of running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the law did not specify any period of use for motor vehicles, it was difficult to enforce the administrative arrangement and exemption was sometimes conceded where the use of the vehicle was for less than a period of two years or 40 000 kilometres of running. This was the case with vehicles supplied for community policing work in Western Australia, where the vehicles were used for only twelve months for the exempt purpose before being returned to the dealer. Most exempt users, however, observed the two year/40 000 kilometres running test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new sales tax law remains in line with the administrative arrangements under the old law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Whether the two years/40,000 kilometres requirement will result in fewer vehicles being made available for community policing activities is a matter between the motor vehicle dealers who provide the vehicles and the WA Police Department. The requirement is the same as that which generally applied under the old law, and which most other exempt users observed and continue to observe. Where the use test is satisfied, the vehicles will be exempt from sales tax, in which case the increase in the sales tax rate will not have an effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Commissioner of Taxation has a discretion to determine a use time other than two years in special circumstances. However, this discretion has to be exercised within the general intent of the law. It would be inappropriate for the Commissioner to exercise the discretion in a way which had the effect of lowering the statutory period of use required in the law. That would amount to the Commissioner making law rather than administering it.</PARA>

<PARA>Question (1).</PARA>
<PARA>  What direct monetary assistance or Full Time Professional Study Grants and Aboriginal Professional Study Award schemes benefit is available on an individual basis to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders under programs operating within the Minister's portfolio?</PARA>
<PARA>Question (2).</PARA>
<PARA>  Which forms of assistance or benefits are not means tested?</PARA>
<PARA>Question (3).</PARA>
<PARA>  How many persons received each form of assistance or benefit in 1992-93?</PARA>
<PARA>Answer (1).</PARA>
<PARA>  In 1992-93 the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) provided money to organisations which then supported individual employees through these schemes. The commitments under the Aboriginal Professional Study Award scheme were transferred to ATSIC as part of the Training for Aboriginals Program (TAP) transferred from the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) on 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>Answer (2).</PARA>
<PARA>  A formal means test is not applied to either scheme. However in awarding the Full Time Professional Study Grants the value of the study to the future development of both the sponsoring organisation and the employee is considered.</PARA>
<PARA>Answer (3).</PARA>
<PARA>  22 organisations received support on behalf of 23 employees under the Full Time Professional Study Grants Scheme. This scheme is administered from Central Office.</PARA>
<PARA>  A Programmed Grants and Loans (PGL) report indicates that 16 Aboriginal Professional Study Awards  which were previously administered by DEET were supported in 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA>  Business Funding Scheme</PARA>
<PARA>Answer (1).</PARA>
<PARA>  The Business Funding Scheme offers low interest business loans to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals to engage in or acquire business enterprises that are assessed as likely to become, or continue to be, commercially successful.</PARA>
<PARA>  The maximum level of funding for individuals per application is $500,000.</PARA>
<PARA>  Interest rates at 1 July 1993 are:</PARA>
<PARA>1.5% for loans up to $50,000</PARA>
<PARA>3% for loans over $50,000 and up to $100,000</PARA>
<PARA>6.5% for loans over $100,000 and up to $500,000.</PARA>
<PARA>  Applicants are required to contribute a minimum of 20% equity to the business and must be able to provide adequate security for the loan.</PARA>
<PARA>Answer (2).</PARA>
<PARA>  Assistance under the Scheme is not means tested. It is a commercial loan program.</PARA>
<PARA>Answer (3).</PARA>
<PARA>  In the 1992-93 financial year $12.479m was allocated to the Business Funding Scheme. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations received $12.151m and 13 individuals successfully obtained loan funding totalling $328,000.</PARA>
<PARA>  Home Ownership Program</PARA>
<PARA>Answer (1).</PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC operates a  Home Ownership Program. The scheme is targeted generally at those Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders who, because of their low income levels, often cannot obtain help from such places as banks and building societies. The interest rate for home loans begins at 5% and rises by half a per cent each year thereafter until it is 1% below the Commonwealth Bank's housing loan interest rate.</PARA>
<PARA>Answer (2).</PARA>
<PARA>  This program is means tested.</PARA>
<PARA>Answer (3).</PARA>
<PARA>  A total of 441 loans were made in 1992-93 which benefited 1,635 people.</PARA>
<PARA>  Sport and Recreation Program, Regional Council budget</PARA>
<PARA>Answer (1).</PARA>
<PARA> This program provides grants to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community organisations to support the sporting and recreational aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This includes funds to enable participation by individuals in sporting carnivals or to assist in purchasing sporting equipment.</PARA>
<PARA>Answer (2).</PARA>
<PARA>  This program is not means tested.</PARA>
<PARA>Answer (3).</PARA>
<PARA>  In respect of Sport and Recreation, information on individuals is not required for funding purposes at the Regional Level where acquittal procedures require information on the number and types of grants rather than information on individuals.</PARA>
<PARA>  Enterprise Employment Assistance Scheme</PARA>
<PARA>Answer (1).</PARA>
<PARA>  The Enterprise Employment Assistance Scheme (EEA), which involves wage subsidy grants to enterprises to enable them to offer jobs to unemployed Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, was amongst those elements transferred to ATSIC as part of the TAP transfer from DEET on 1 July 1992. Many of the wage subsidy grants made by DEET under the EEA Scheme were to individual employers. ATSIC accepted responsibility for all outstanding payments in respect of those grants. Since assuming responsibility for the TAP community elements, ATSIC has not approved any new EEA wage subsidy grants to individuals.</PARA>
<PARA>Answer (2).</PARA>
<PARA>  There is no means test associated with the EEA Scheme. Employers are required to demonstrate that they are able to pay award wages to EEA subsidised employees as well as all wage related costs. They are also expected to retain the employee after the wage subsidy ceases. Answer (3).</PARA>
<PARA>  104 people (ie. sole trade businesses) received EEA wage subsidy grants in 1992-93.</PARA>
