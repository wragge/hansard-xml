<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a matter of privilege arising out of a communication sent by the Communication Workers Union to a number of members of this House and action taken by that union consequent upon that communication. The effect of it is to place an indefinite ban on the delivery&mdash;and I understand in many cases the dispatch&mdash;of mail articles in and out of members' offices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This seems to me to be a very clear breach of privilege. I have been able to establish that questions of privilege have been raised in this House on two previous occasions: once in 1978 by the former member for Maranoa relating to a general ban, and on a second occasion in May 1985 the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) raised a question of privilege in relation to the banning of express <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier Mail</EMPHASIS> articles to Queensland. On that occasion Madam Speaker Childs declined to grant the matter priority on the grounds that the ban affected members of the public generally and was not specifically directed towards members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion the ban clearly falls into the latter category. Members of parliament are being singled out for the purposes of the ban and it does seem that it is a breach of the privileges of members of both sides of this House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Special Minister of State. Is it a fact that at the weekend the chief executives of 15 major Australian mining companies described the Mabo legislation as `extraordinarily complex' and `unworkable' and said that the continuing uncertainty generated by it would `jeopardise development, diminish and delay investment and reduce economic growth and employment opportunities'. Why is the government trying to railroad this legislation through parliament this year when so many Australians have such deep concerns about its impact?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9T4">Mr WALKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that such advertisements did appear in the national press. There is nothing new about that, of course; there have been campaigns in the past by the mining industry with respect to land rights and Aboriginal affairs, and this is yet another one of them. This argument that somehow the native title legislation can be simple&mdash;a one-page bill that some people have proposed&mdash;is absolutely ridiculous. Native title affects land management in this country. There is a wide raft of legislation across the states and the federal arena dealing with land management, from real property acts, conveyancing acts, mining legislation, crown land legislation, the law of trusts&mdash;endless provisions. In New South Wales alone, some 4,000 pages of legislation deal with land management. We cannot pass an act relating to a new title that impacts upon all aspects of land management without drafting fairly long and complex legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why the Commonwealth reached this decision was that, in the many negotiations we had with state governments, it was the state governments that put high on the agenda many of the provisions that now appear in our legislation. A great deal of the length and complexity of the legislation is based on agreements we reached with state governments because they felt that this sort of legislation was necessary.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who take a simplistic attitude about this and say that it can be pushed away in a document of a page, 10 pages or even 47 pages are completely wrong. They have no understanding whatsoever about what land management is in this country. It is a very complex area of the law. No more detailed area of the law exists than land management, and native title impacts upon that.</PARA>

The fact of the matter is that no issue in the history of politics of the Commonwealth government has been given more ministerial time and more time for debate&mdash;we have spent more than a year debating this at great length&mdash;and the time has come for the uncertainty that relates to mining titles in this country to be cleared up and for justice to be given to Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has his attention been drawn to recent employment statistics for the Australian economy?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since we last met, we have had further confirmation that the Australian economy is strengthening and that employment and output are increasing in a well-balanced way. Last week we had confirmation that over the last three months to November there has been the creation of 100,000 jobs in the economy. We saw last week GDP for the year recorded at 3.4 per cent&mdash;a rise of 0.4 per cent in the September quarter&mdash;with contributions to growth coming from the private sector, including a strong performance from business investment in plant and equipment. In fact, business investment grew by 3.4 per cent in the September quarter and nearly 11 per cent over the year. If we disaggregate that for plant and equipment, we find that plant and equipment rose by 14.4 per cent over the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at exports, the current account numbers for October show continuing gains in exports and, in fact, the current account deficit this year is actually running lower than the current account deficit for the same period in the last financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to profits. In the corporate sector, profits rose strongly in the September quarter to levels not seen since the late 1980s. You might remember, Mr Speaker, that the levels in the late 1980s were above any historical experience for Australia&mdash;above the so-called golden years of the 1960s to levels which were unprecedented. The profit levels in the economy today are at levels not seen since the late 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also add that private sector surveys confirm the trend. The BCA survey reported today, and the ACCI survey into investor confidence and the Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index tell the same stories. We see it reflected in this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine. Its poll of forecasters in Europe, the United States and Japan shows Australia at the top of the growth table in 1993 among 13 OECD economies surveyed. It predicts we will grow even faster next year and it shows we are doing it with one of the lowest inflation rates in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing a stronger expansion in the economy and one that is flowing right into employment and jobs. I think the moral of the tale is simply this: if the Australian community wishes to keep the expansion going it does so by sticking with the policies of this government, which have been vehemently attacked at every step along the way by the federal opposition. I remind the House that back in February of this year&mdash;not that long ago in economic forecasting terms&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition was warning of a double dip recession:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The Australian economy may double dip' warns Hewson.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for his judgments or his frighteners about the economy. Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we get a quick recovery as a result of some stimulatory package&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this was in One Nation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it will be a disaster for this country because we will go back to the old boom-bust cycle and have an exchange rate crisis before the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA>That was, of course, 1992. There was no boom-bust; no exchange rate crisis before the end of the year. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One Nation spends about $23 billion, which is unfunded. It will blow this country out of the water if it is successful in the sense of actually stimulating economic activity. It will precipitate both an exchange rate crisis and acceleration of inflation. I find it hard to believe that inflation will not again accelerate to at least the five per cent level that Chris Murphy has identified.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The qualification at the end of the statement by the Leader of the Opposition was his own, not mine or my department's. I have said in this place and elsewhere that proposals have been put forward in the context of preparing the green paper on employment opportunities that extra revenue should be raised in order to fund some of the initiatives proposed in those submissions. The green paper is to be released this week. The reason that the government has proceeded on the basis of a green paper preparatory to determining its own policy is precisely to allow for public debate about these questions. I do not intend to pre-empt the debate which may ensue following the release of that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I have made is that those people who propose that additional revenue should be imposed in order to fund additional expenditure initiatives need to persuade the community of the efficacy of those initiatives and, therefore, the desirability of raising revenue. That is something which stands before those who make these propositions. But beyond that, I think it would be a contradiction of the approach the government has taken, that is, to have a wide-ranging debate involving the community about this central issue of employment, for me to pre-empt that debate now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I should make the point that it rings a little hollow for the Leader of the Opposition to be making statements like this about the plight of the unemployed. Of course, he has never been concerned about these people. He has never been concerned about the need to address the issue of those people who have been affected by change within the Australian community. I mentioned in a speech last week that it was necessary for us, as we proceed with the necessary structural change in Australia, to take account of the consequences for ordinary people and to have sensitive policy approaches to take into account their particular circumstances. This, of course, is something which the Leader of the Opposition pays no attention to and takes no heed of whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government is on about is focusing attention on unemployment as being a major issue, a major policy challenge, one which needs to be addressed in the context of an economy which is growing and becoming daily more competitive and more productive. In that context we have to ensure that the circumstances of those people who have been affected by change and by the recent period of inadequate growth in the economy&mdash;the recent recession, if you like&mdash;should be taken into account in terms of the policy response which the government makes. I think the government has perfect credentials to address the wide scope of this debate about improving employment opportunities, both from the point of view of improving the performance of the economy and in responding to the very real social dimension of this question. We have the credentials to deal with that issue; frankly, the Leader of the Opposition does not.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also direct my question to the Treasurer. He will be aware that the New South Wales government announced on 25 November that it would sell the State Bank of New South Wales via a `public trade sale'. Can the Treasurer explain to the House what requirements this public trade sale will need to meet in order for the Commonwealth government to approve the transfer of ownership of the State Bank?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3788" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question, in which he noted the fact that the New South Wales government has announced its intention to sell the State Bank of New South Wales and asked what we would do in that context. We will, of course, apply the same principles in the case of the State Bank of New South Wales as we would apply in the case of any proposed change of ownership of an Australian bank. These principles rest on two fundamental concerns: firstly, the need for the maintenance of confidence in the banking system; and, secondly, the need to maintain effective competition within the banking system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a policy statement on 18 June, I set out the major elements which would underpin the way in which we would try to achieve those two joint objectives. I do not intend to repeat those, except to mention some of them which are relevant to this consideration. In the first instance, the trade sale approach, which is being taken by the New South Wales government, implies that the prospective new owner or owners would seek to have shareholdings above 10 per cent each. That means that an application would need to be made under the Banks (Shareholdings) Act. Applications under this act will continue to be considered on a case by case basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While each case is considered on its merit, the following broad comments should be made. Mergers between regional and smaller banks, including state banks, are in general likely to be permitted subject to the considerations spelled out in my statement. While reducing the number of players, such mergers can potentially increase competition, as a newly merged entity may well provide more effective competition against the major players. Mergers between a major bank and a state, regional or smaller bank might be permitted if this did not detract significantly from local competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with previously announced policy, mergers between any of the four major banks or a major life company will not be permitted. A merger between two of the major players is likely to detract more from effective competition than would be in the national interest. This is particularly the case given that such a merger would result in an institution that was far larger than the other key players and so might be expected to prompt calls for further mergers or acquisitions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That said, the government is not opposed in principle to a non-mutual life office owning a bank, provided that the life office can demonstrate sufficient financial strength, has a diverse share register consistent with the provisions of the Banks (Shareholdings) Act and accepts supervision by the Reserve Bank of itself to the extent necessary to ensure the integrity of its subsidiary or associated bank and the stability in the overall financial system. Legislative changes may be necessary to achieve this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mergers in the banking industry require the approval of the Treasurer and are also subject to the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act. From a competitive point of view, the government will not limit merger possibilities to domestic bidders. As indicated in the One Nation statement, bids by foreign banks will be considered on a case by case basis for banks other than the four big Australian banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is concerned to monitor and regulate these transfers of bank ownership. Where it is a bank that is currently under state government ownership, the relevant state government may wish to impose additional requirements of its own. That is a matter for the state government and for its parliament. As far as the proposal is concerned, we are happy to work with the government of New South Wales to ensure that the proposed change of ownership of the State Bank of New South Wales occurs in a way which is supportive of the continuing confidence in the banking system in Australia and which also maintains effective competition within the system.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should have thought that the opposition might have learned something from the last election: that trying to shift a great dose of national income across to doctors got it a very strong rebuke in the election. Trying to pull away at the entrails of Medicare got the opposition precisely the kind of response that we believed it would get in putting those policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is about to consider the totality of that part of the health scheme, particularly as it relates to private health, and I am not, for the purposes of this question, going to disturb cabinet debate on that. I have made clear my general position on the notion that people should have to pay for private insurance and that people on high incomes cannot avail themselves of the public health system. If the argument were true, it would be just as true of education or anything else, and that would mean that high income earners could not send their kids to a public school. I do not think very many people in the House would argue that case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond that, we will be looking at the health scheme in a comprehensive way to see how we can improve it. But the fundamental point is that the basic system works. Medicare is working so well that people are leaving the private health system and joining the public health system. In fact, if anything, Medicare has been very successful in taking clientele from the private health system to the public health system. Those are the core facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a health system which has lasted just on a decade, which has held the national costs of health at about half those of the United States, which has a fee-for-service private practice system of health and which has a uniform health insurance system across the country by which people can avail themselves of health care. There is not a health system for the well-off and a philanthropic health system for the poor; there is one health system which has two characteristics&mdash;public and private. We want to see those two characteristics of the system work in harmony. That is what the review is about, and obviously that is what we will be looking at in our cabinet discussion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister made mention of one policy jurisdiction for which the opposition deservedly copped a massive rebuke from the people at the last election. The automotive industry is another example of a whole suite of areas where the opposition copped something similar. By comparison with the government's approach to this important industry&mdash;a phased reduction in tariff protection to 15 per cent by the year 2000; a comprehensive export facilitation scheme; and a commitment to maintaining the industry, as evidenced by a whole range of government programs&mdash;the opposition walked away from the industry at the last election campaign. That is a policy position that has not been forgotten by anyone remotely associated with the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent figures are cause for considerable optimism in relation to this important sector. Car sales have improved. The sales component of Australian produced cars has increased&mdash;quite dramatically increased&mdash;at a rate faster than that for the market as a whole. Indeed, in 1993 it is up almost eight per cent on last year's figures. Of the mainstream Australian produced motor vehicles, Camry is up 17 per cent; Falcon, 14 per cent; Magna, 13 per cent; and Commodore, eight per cent. This means that in 1993 the automotive sector should produce vehicles and automotive components worth $1 billion more than for the corresponding period last year. It is also worth pointing out that automotive exports, as a direct function of government policy, have also continued to supplement that market growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exports are projected to increase by 15 to 20 per cent in 1993. That will take the export figures to over $1.4 billion from almost zilch when Labor came to power. One company, General Motors, has announced an accumulative profit of $303 million over the last four years.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3793" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HOTHAM" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. Recently I had the opportunity to be in the electorate of the honourable member for Herbert to announce a very important set of proposals under our infrastructure package. The infrastructure package for the sugar industry was part of the general sugar industry package that this government announced at the end of last year. It was a package that was designed to ensure that expansion and growth occurred in this important industry but recognised the fact that, if we were to get expansion and get the freeing up of some of the state regulatory environment, there needed to be infrastructure to underpin that expansion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this package we were able to get the state government to cooperate in some important changes to the sugar industry under its purview&mdash;namely, the narrowing of the margin in the pooling prices for sugar as well as the allocation systems for land. It was only because we were prepared to sit down with the industry and the state government that could have influence in these particular areas that we were able to develop a package that made sense to the industry. The infrastructure package involved the commitment by this government of some $19 million to the Queensland industry, which was to be matched in the first instance dollar for dollar by the state government. But the $38 million that the two governments put in has seen a total expenditure on infrastructure committed by local government, by stakeholders and by the governments of some $117 million. So the $38 million, including our initial $19 million, has significantly leveraged commitment to infrastructure expansion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immediate impact of this infrastructure expansion will be the creation of 1,900 jobs in Queensland for the construction phase, a beneficial impact to a third of the growers in that state, an ability to increase the production of this industry by 1 1/2 million tonnes and a commitment to expand our export earnings from this industry by $60 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals benefit both existing development, where they go to drainage and technology initiatives to improve the yield, and new expansion areas, where the money will fund irrigation and railway infrastructure. In recent months, the sugar industry has received some very welcome news: returns to growers in that industry have gone up 13 per cent over the last year; export earnings are up by 10 per cent and will move past the $1 billion mark in the next year. There will be added benefit from any breakthroughs we get through the GATT negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This infrastructure will underpin the expansion. It comes about because of a commitment by this government to work with the industry in the development of a pro-active strategy. Those on the other side argue that they had a package for the sugar industry, but they would not even have thought about it if we had not announced ours. We are committed to working with industry to develop the growth strategy and secure the growth path. This is another very important example of our not only undertaking the activity of identifying opportunity, but also delivering on it.</PARA>

The country has every reason to be pleased by these trends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth in employment is expected to continue, given the four-digit indicators provided by a number of job vacancy series.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his statement on Saturday welcoming me back to my position as parliamentary secretary. I also wish to thank all my colleagues on both sides of the House for their expressions of goodwill and support over this very difficult period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all honourable members would be aware that, less than 72 hours after I voluntarily stood down from my position, the person alleged to have made the statements totally disowned the newspaper article and categorically denied any impropriety on my part. In addition, the entire executive of the Chinese students human rights organisation swore statutory declarations confirming no impropriety existed and declaring their support for me. Despite this, I insisted that the Federal Police inquiry be completed, and I am delighted that it has cleared me of any wrongdoing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I believe that this episode raises serious issues about the vulnerability of members of parliament to scurrilous and unfounded attacks. This is especially the case when such attacks occur not in the mainstream national media but in small journals which do not take seriously their responsibilities with respect to the laws of defamation. I believe that honourable members need protection from this kind of attack on their character and reputation. I shall be writing to you, Mr Speaker, and the Chairman of the Privileges Committee to ask for an examination of this general issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I have been very heartened by the hundreds of letters and phone calls that I have received from Chinese students. I believe their cause is a just one, and I shall continue to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) clearly alleged that certain statements were made by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) which had not been made. A careful examination of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the following day clearly demonstrated that the Leader of the House had falsely attributed quite detrimental remarks to the honourable member for Higgins. Those detrimental remarks allegedly made by the honourable member for Higgins were given quite wide publicity the following day in the press. That caused a great deal of concern, not only to the honourable member for Higgins, but to others on this side the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing to falsely allege something about an opposite number, for that to be denied and the matter to pass without reporting; but the claim by the Leader of the House that the honourable member for Higgins had made a sexist remark got a lot of press. It strikes us as particularly unreasonable and unfair that somebody can get up, make a statement alleging something that was not said, or not even remotely alluded to, get a big run out of it and then just sit there in a satisfied Pontius Pilate fashion as though nothing has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again invite the Leader of the House to withdraw even at this belated stage. I have said in the past that he is a man who is not without honour and decency. I hope that he would match that high regard I have for him and withdraw those remarks. They were unworthy of him as the statement was not uttered. He deliberately misrepresented what the honourable member for Higgins had said, and that is beyond argument when one looks at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance is about health or, more correctly, the government's response to the health of Australia. Its confusion and division on health policy are going to reach their climax this week when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) meet each other in a battle of will over the future of Medicare, private health insurance and Australia's health care system. The crisis in Medicare has at long last been recognised by the man the Prime Minister chose to be the Minister for Health. Last week, he is quoted as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're going to reach crisis point, I think, in health care fairly soon. We are not going to be able to sustain things.</PARA>
<PARA>That crisis involves long public hospital waiting lists&mdash;estimated by some to be around 100,000 Australians&mdash;a massive imbalance between public and private health systems, and a continuing decline in the number of Australians with private health care cover. The Prime Minister seems to be the lone figure who recognises the magnitude of the health problem facing this country and in his usual arrogant fashion has pitted himself against his own health minister. We heard this in question time today. The Prime Minister commented that the system works well; it works so well that in fact people are leaving the private health insurance system. I will comment on that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is no newcomer to the politicising of health at the expense of needy Australians. He turned the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe), who is at the table, into a lame duck health minister by thwarting his moves to fix Medicare with a co-payment system. In those days that was his ticket to the prime ministership. Today it is political self-interest and an insatiable need to get his own way, even at the expense of the community at large. Whatever the merits or otherwise of Senator Richardson's proposal, it seems that the Prime Minister will put his own self-interest first. It will be that self-interest that will undoubtedly torpedo any move to restructure the system so that it can provide for the health needs of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a worrying set of problems in health in Australia. The first is that we have an ageing population. A hundred years ago we had a million people, with an average age of 20 years. Today it is 17,000,000 people, with an average age of 31 years. In 10 years it will be 20,000,000 people, with an average age of 36 years. By the year 2000 it is estimated that two in every seven Australians will be over 50 years of age. For the year I turn 65, in 2021, the aged population in Australia will peak. Two-thirds of our health care dollars are spent on people over 60 years of age. One-quarter of all our health care is spent on less than four per cent of the population over 75 years of age. Even without changes that have been mooted by Senator Richardson, health care costs of Australians are going to rise dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where we are with health today in Australia. There has been static expenditure on health for the last 13 years. Australia failed to keep pace on national health care compared to other OECD countries. We once had a system that it could realistically be said was second to none. With ceilings put on it for over 13 years, it is straining. We have a greater number of people requiring health care services and  the standards very much depend on finance available. The greatest con is that the Medicare levy covers the health system&mdash;it covers about one-quarter of it. The result is that public health is under-funded, overcrowded and private hospital resources are under-utilised. We have waiting lists. Privately insured patients use public hospital beds. In 1989, a quarter of all acute bed days were private patients in public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of private health insurance has gone up 72 per cent over the last three years. The Prime Minister would not know this, of course, because he does not have it. The numbers have fallen from 60 per cent to under 40 per cent over the last 10 years. The paradox for us is that, for every one per cent which opts out of private health insurance, it costs the public sector an extra $80 million a year. Recent reports warn that, unless there is a substantial increase in private health insurance by the year 2000, Australia's health care bill will increase by $2 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are we in this situation? It is fairly simple and it can all be traced back directly to decisions made by the Labor Party, the first of which was the reinsurance pool. This was introduced in the late 1970s to share the cost of elderly Australians and of chronically ill Australians. It was over $100 million in 1983 and it kept the cost of private health insurance down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was easy money. It was targeted. It was abolished, and so the community rating principle could not survive when there was no equalisation of the costs of elderly Australians or those who were chronically ill. That means that today for every dollar put into private health care by people over 65 years of age, they take out something like $1.50. That is not a bad bet. But for every dollar put into private health care by people aged 25 years, they take out about 12c. Young Australians are leaving private insurance in droves and why would they not? They would be stupid to do anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what is Senator Richardson trying to do? He is trying to introduce a two tier system of Medicare with an additional levy for the rich to force them to take out private health insurance. We have nothing against an extra levy per se provided it is used to render low and middle income earners able to take out private health insurance. If the government does not do that&mdash;if it just slugs the rich an extra tax&mdash;it means there will be one system for the rich and one for the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson has two other proposals: making funds more viable by amalgamating them, which seems curious; and making doctors employees of hospitals, which seems even more curious. Yet Senator Richardson is at least trying to do something, even if we do not fundamentally agree with what he is doing.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of November in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think my plan will stand up to analysis and I'll still be trying to get up at the end.</PARA>
<PARA>That was very interesting because the Prime Minister's response to that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> had been:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, he's going to need a lot of . . . courage.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister thinks about health insurance this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm now paying much more, say, than someone on a low income and that's been the principle of Medicare. Now I think the government would need a lot of convincing to move away from that.</PARA>
<PARA>Richardson's reply was made to the Australian Health Insurance Association when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While you may not believe that I am an expert at any of this, I am a world expert on power.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what this is all about. It is about power; it is about two big egos in one cabinet room full of a lot of big egos, and it will be interesting to see the result. The criticisms of Senator Richardson's proposals are basically these: there is no incentive whatsoever for low to middle income earners to get into private health insurance. They are currently virtually denied access to it and neither the Minister for Health nor the Prime Minister acknowledge or care to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirteen per cent of pensioners choose to take out private health insurance. That is a struggle. A million Australians earning $40,000 or less are choosing to be privately insured. That is not much of a choice when the price has gone up 72 per cent in the last three years. If the government leaves these people out in the cold, public hospital waiting lists will continue to grow. Senator Richardson understands this. In recent times he has made the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view, we cannot continue to have private health insurance bleed in the way that it has in the past years because this does increase the strains on the public system.</PARA>
<PARA>Absolutely. He is also quoted as saying recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trouble is that when people on higher incomes drop out of private insurance, they do elbow the old pensioner out of the queue because if you are on one hundred grand ($100,000) a year, you do know how to work the systems.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the essence of our problem. In fact, there are three fundamental problems. The first is: Medicare simply does not have the capacity to provide what it claims to provide. I remember very well that in 1984 when Medicare came in the then Special Minister of State, Mr Mick Young, had a headline article in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun</EMPHASIS> entitled `Medicare is all you need'. Today Mick Young might have a look at the public hospital system and how it is attempting to transfer costs from state governments to the federal government to cope with its under financing and over demand. This has been going on for years and no minister on the other side has had the guts to do anything about it. We have only to talk to any doctor at the coalface in the public hospital system to realise that there is a massive shift of funds from state to federal in an attempt to cope&mdash;even in spite of the fact that it is distinctly against the Commonwealth-State health agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is done in three areas. The first is pharmacy. Ten years ago patients could go home from a public hospital with an adequate supply of pharmaceuticals. Today they are lucky to get away with two to three days before they have to send someone down to the pharmacy to get a script paid for by the federal government. Another area is procedures, particularly gastroenterology. I remember as a junior doctor being surprised to find that there were no gastroscopes being done in a certain hospital in Melbourne. They had all been shuffled off to one of the private clinics nearby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember asking the registrar, `How on earth do they get the referrals?'. He was surprised and said, `Gee, I don't know'. After a couple of seconds he looked shocked and said, `Yes, I do know where they get the referrals from. It is actually from me. That is what I've been signing in recent times'. It is cost shifting. It is taking those procedures out of the public hospital system, whacking the cost on to the federal government and, again, the federal government has been powerless to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most recently, we have had the farce of so-called privatisation of outpatient clinics. This is really a complete misnomer. I rang a GP in Melbourne today when we put forward this MPI to ask him how he was faring with so-called privatised outpatient services. He told me a story of one of his patients last week who needed a neurology referral and who had to go to a so-called privatised clinic. In fact, that patient was waiting for just as long as would have been the case in the old public hospital outpatients department. The fact is the costs are being shifted across to the feds and the feds are incapable of doing anything about it. That person could have a referral within 48 hours if he or she were a private patient. This is acknowledged by the head of the Victorian Department of Health and Community Services, John Paterson. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"We all work away quietly doing a bit of cost shifting in our own favour if we can get away with it, while the Commonwealth automatically tries to play the states off against each other, partly for financial reasons but substantially for hegemonic ones" he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"All this would be fine if the sole objective was to keep politicians and officials entertained. The long suffering public remains deluded that their wellbeing is central. If that were really so we would immediately play a different and much simpler game.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Medicare was a "major element of Australia's tragic farce of a national health and welfare financing system". . .</PARA>
<PARA>That was said by one of the guys who has been doing it. The government has been incapable of addressing it for a decade. We are also seeing an increase in services. That is why it is costing so much. That is where the pressure is coming from. It is increasing by seven to nine per cent a year. A co-payment would have done something about that, but that was not allowed to happen. Anyone who works in the system knows about it. I know about it. I have a very active medical practice in this House for which I am paid absolutely nothing. About 60 per cent of the members of the House come to see me&mdash;that is, 60 per cent who sit on one side of the House&mdash;because I think I am now the only medico in the House of Representatives. I am always delighted to see them. But in the majority of cases they whip out their Medicare card in order to pay me. I am absolutely entitled to take that. I choose not to because I cannot see why, on a full-time salary, I should hit the government for another expense. But a lot of doctors do; they are entitled to do it and it pushes up the cost of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing waiting lists. I phoned a neurosurgeon in Melbourne this morning to ask him whether any, or many, of his patients had to pay for their own treatment. In the last 12 months six people waiting for spinal surgery, waiting in pain, waiting terrified about what the future might hold, took out bank loans and paid for their own services&mdash;and that was from this one doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that if none of these proposals which are going to cabinet gains any acceptance, the government has to ask what it is going to do to ensure an accessible and affordable quality health care system. I can predict what the minister who is at the table is going to say. He is going to talk about two million Australians being uninsured before Medicare. This is the Goebbels principle; this is the big lie. This is a case of thinking that if one repeats something often enough, people will believe it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have looked at the ABS survey on private health insurance. The majority of those two million people came from Queensland where they got free health care. A lot of others were pensioners who had access to health care and others were veterans who had access to health care. So the figure is a complete lie; it is a complete fabrication. In the end, the government is going to be faced with either a massive infusion of money to stop the haemorrhaging or it is going to have to face up to the real question: how are we going to pay for the health care of the nation? We should be looking at these issues, not the farcical issue of who is more powerful: the Prime Minister or the Minister for Health. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regard it as rather extraordinary that the coalition should schedule an MPI on the topic of confusion and division on health policy. It is extraordinary because there is simply no area of coalition policy that has been so unsuccessful and divisive over the past decade. The coalition has had seven spokespeople on health since 1983. Five have left the parliament, or are leaving, as in the case of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton). Only the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) remains in this chamber and the present incumbent, Senator Newman, remains in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition seems to have had a self-destruct button when it comes to health policy. Who can forget the sad saga of Peter Shack and his disastrous attempt to introduce a new health policy in 1989? By his own account, he prepared a comprehensive plan, which he described as simple and easy to understand. Yet the coalition went to the 1990 election without a health policy. It was one of the great mysteries of that March 24 election: where was the opposition's much vaunted health policy? The hapless Mr Shack was left to carry the blame when it was clear that the Liberal leadership group itself abandoned the package because it feared it would harm its vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the 1990 election, a member of that leadership group and then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), described his party's health scheme as a political disaster. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were not many people reading them and not many people understanding them. I think we are also being pretty honest to say some of our policies we need to take back to the drawing board.</PARA>
<PARA>So back to the drawing board the coalition went, and Dr Bob Woods came on board as the health spokesperson. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) clearly could not repeat the mistake of 1990 and not have a health policy. So in the preparation of Fightback he went for a radical option which he claimed would strengthen Medicare. That plan, put simply, was to abolish bulkbilling for 13 million Australians; to make Australians pay $32 up front for each GP visit; to slash the Medicare rebate by 10 per cent; and to cut $1.3 billion a year in funding for public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia have considerable regard for Medicare. It has a higher approval rating now than it has ever had. It entitles everyone universally to health care. It allows Australians to choose whether they want to be treated in the public system or in the private system. Medicare, then, is about certainty. It is also about being able to afford to go to the doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, the recipe of the Leader of the Opposition was for uncertainty and more expensive health. The people of Australia understood the threat to Medicare represented by the coalition. When they voted for this Labor government, they were voting for Medicare and for a health system they could rely on. So strong was the feeling that the coalition's health spokesman Dr Woods lost his seat of Lowe. Quite simply, he had been given the task of defending the indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 13 March the coalition went through another of the soul-searching exercises that it has become so accustomed to after five successive losses. It is interesting to note that once again health was seen as an Achilles heel. The new health spokesperson, Senator Newman, admitted in an interview with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 10 April that the coalition's health policy had harmed its poll chances. She claimed that the Australian people did not understand the policy. She wished that the policy had been different because it had left the coalition open to what she described as a damaging scare campaign. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To that extent, well I would have wished it was different. I didn't say the policy was wrong. It just simply left us open to a fear campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>The people of Australia know that they cannot trust the coalition with Medicare. Senator Newman has not ruled out the worst aspects of the policy the coalition took to the election with the abolition of bulkbilling for 13 million Australians. The coalition spokesperson on social security, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), admitted as recently as last month that the coalition had no real idea about where it was going with its social security and welfare policy. He said in a speech that, although eight months had passed since the election, it was not timely for him to outline any new initiatives. If there is any confusion or any division, it is not on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor introduced Medicare in 1984 to provide every Australian with access to health care. We will continue to develop and build on that policy because it has been very successful. It has been successful because, unlike the scheme in the United States, it has enabled us to control health costs and to sustain expenditure in health at around eight per cent of GDP throughout the decade that has been operating. Medicare has been a sound policy because, effectively, in visiting primary general practitioners, the question of cost does not arise; people are able to make that decision on health grounds. Medicare means that people have access to the primary point of the health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard comments from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) to the effect that the public hospital system in this country has not been able to cope. When we look at the facts of the case, we know that that is not true; that throughout the 1980s the health system has coped with an increased number of hospital visits and an increased number of procedures&mdash;and coped very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outstanding characteristic of the public hospital system in this country, and also perhaps the larger private hospitals, has been the dramatic increases in productivity. Each year there has been growth in the number of patients treated. Essentially, that has occurred because of improvements in technology and quality of care. Those improvements have meant reduced stays for people in public hospitals, with the result that the hospital system has been able to cope with more patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1980s, we also saw the introduction of day surgery on a much wider scale. Day surgery has meant that more and more patients have been able to receive top treatment with stays in hospital of only a few hours. It is those improvements in technology and in the organisation and productivity of the health system that have enabled us to sustain higher levels of in-hospital treatment than almost any other country in the developed world. At the same time, the overall level of expenditure has been around eight per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that quite recently we ensured funding for the public hospital system for the next five years through the negotiation of Medicare agreements. Part of those agreements related to the question of waiting times. For the first time, through the Institute of Health and Welfare, we will be getting a feeling for waiting lists and waiting times on a national basis. We will also establish a state charter of patients rights which will give patients access to much better information about the way that waiting lists are managed. We will then move to the situation where waiting lists are managed more by hospitals and hospital administrators than by individual doctors who often have a pecuniary interest in how patients are classified and when and how they are treated. Reform in those areas will be extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member opposite has referred to the question of trends in relation to private health insurance. It would have been extraordinary had there not been some change in that area, given the reintroduction of Medicare in 1984. That change occurred and, as a result of universal health insurance, after a sharp initial decline, there has been a gradual decline in private health insurance. Where private health insurance is likely to settle is a matter for question and debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the government's policy is that people should have a choice between public and private health insurance, it would be surprising if there were not sustainable levels of private health insurance in this country in the longer term. That choice is open. In the long run, one would expect, just as increasing numbers of patients are being treated in private hospitals, there to continue to be an increase in the supplementary insurance levels. So Medicare clearly means a shift in the balance between public and private funding&mdash;between those who are covered through Medicare and those who choose to be covered by private insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the best indicator of whether or not people have private insurance is clearly not people's age but effectively people's income. Private health insurance has always been carried by those on very high incomes. Only a small proportion of those on incomes over $50,000 do not take out private health insurance. So private health insurance has been an option for those on higher incomes and an option that the vast majority of them have chosen to take up. Private health insurance clearly has a place, just as the private hospital system has a place within the overall health system in Australia. The private hospital system has in fact been expanding throughout the 1980s and, of course, has been increasing in that patients are being treated more rapidly than in the public sector. So the government is committed to that dual system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the negotiations on Medicare, there has been experimentation with a new approach to pricing within the health system, particularly the public hospital system. That experimentation centres around the concept of DRGs&mdash;diagnostic related groups&mdash;or casemix. Over the next five years, under the current Medicare agreements, casemix will be introduced universally within the public hospital system in Australia. The Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) recognises the applicability and relevance of casemix to the private hospital sector and is looking at options to introduce casemix more rapidly to the private hospital system and the implications of that move in terms of the costs and availability of private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to the opposition, which has been so divided and has failed to develop over a long period policies that were sufficiently sustainable even to get it through an election period or to enable it to defend its policies publicly during that time, the government goes on quietly developing policy. That policy is being developed on a basis that will allow consultation with those who are most affected and that will allow us to think through the issues that are involved. This will ensure in the longer term that we have a health system in this country that continues to be sustainable, that continues to use the best technology available, that continues to be affordable in price, that continues to be based on principles of universality as we have had in the Medicare system and that ensures people have a choice between the public and private sector. We will go on debating with the coalition for as long as it wants to abolish bulk-billing, for as long as it wants to rip the heart out of Medicare, for as long as it wants to defend the interests of doctors over and against other interests and for as long as it does not put the health of Australians as its prime consideration. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Minister for Health is very open about the problem. He puts on record quite regularly the figures that contrast strongly to the story that the minister for community services tried to give us when he tried yet again to return to the lying propaganda against the opposition's medical and health policies of the last election campaign. I will not take up time on that today because that election campaign has been won and lost and there will be another election campaign. Clearly, government members think that, by repeating the lying propaganda of the last election campaign that was directed by the Australian Labor Party towards the coalition, they might win some votes for the next election. Like so many things, that is only a smokescreen to take people's attention away from the present problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the present problems are in no small measure due to the previous Minister for Health, the one who spoke to us here just a minute ago. It is rather ironic that he was the minister when the 1991 budget attempted to introduce a co-payment into the health system. That attempted introduction of the co-payment was a major factor in the downfall of the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, which certainly led to Senator Crowley's becoming very vocal in her support of the present incumbent's bid for the prime ministership&mdash;a huge irony, because it is now the choice of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of Senator Richardson as the Minister for Health, who is trying to rewrite the health story in Australia. This week we will see how successful he is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Health has made it very clear that he is very patient: he knows how to talk and he knows how to do numbers. He said that he will not go into cabinet and have a confrontation with the Prime Minister; he will make sure he has the numbers before he gets that far. He said that he will go into cabinet having persuaded a sufficient number of people of the rightness of his proposed policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last election, the Prime Minister had a lot to say about the health system that is now in such desperate need of repair. Only last February, in a press release, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a simple, affordable system of universal health care. It means no-one is denied medical treatment because they can't afford to pay.</PARA>
<PARA>Daily, that is denied by his present Minister for Health. On 25 February, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've got half a percentage problem in hospital admittance for elective surgery, therefore we should wreck Medicare and put in basically a private health insurance system.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, he was being sarcastic. The Prime Minister continued:</PARA>

<PARA>The then Minister for Health&mdash;now the minister for community services&mdash;also spent a lot of time during the election campaign saying that all this talk about waiting lists was just so much propaganda put out by enemies of the government. So, pre-election, there was a denial of the problem, but now there is an admission of the crisis. For example, only last week at the Harkness Health Conference here in Canberra, the Minister for Health said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a lot of people in Australia who wait in pain and discomfort for procedures that they need. To them the definition `elective' means nothing. Now when I look at them I don't want to go to the lady that waits three years for a hip in Perth and tell her it was all part of the plan. I want a better plan than that, much better.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the plan he is now trying to bring in which is causing the great crisis and division within the party. Also, on that occasion, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And it is going to come to a crunch point for those low income people who are in private health insurance very soon. It just isn't far away. We can all sit back and let it happen and say it doesn't matter. The argument I've heard proffered is, it doesn't really matter if private medicine is not there, we've still got a public system.</PARA>
<PARA>Presumably, this is the argument the minister is hearing in caucus. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when you add millions of people into a public system which is already showing some strain in some places, you'll get problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister's words have been well documented on what will happen to low income and non-insured people if large numbers of people leave the private insurance system, as indeed they are&mdash;it will affect the battler, the person who cannot afford insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time he opens his mouth on the subject, the minister acknowledges the importance of private insurance. Under the previous Minister for Health, the simple story of private insurance was that the percentage of the population that had private health insurance decreased by more than 20 per cent in the three-year period. Within the last week the figures from Senator Richardson's own lips were that, in September 1990, 61.5 per cent of the Australian population had some private health insurance, but it is now less than 39 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the March-June 1993 quarter, the last quarter for which we have figures, 57,000 Australians dropped their private health insurance. It is this desertion of the private system in such numbers that has the minister so worried. The Labor propaganda no longer holds up. Those opposite cannot say that the Medicare system is adequate for Australians or does the job. They can only say that if there are enough Australians privately insured who are not using the public system. But when people can no longer afford insurance because costs are going up in the private sector and because no incentives are given to people to take out private insurance&mdash;people such as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), on an income of more than $200,000 a year, will not pay the couple of grand it would cost to get the very best private insurance, and some people would say that people like him bludge on the system&mdash;that is what is putting the pressure on. This is what the minister knows must be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has been very public on the importance of the private system. On 26 October, he said in the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view, we cannot continue to have private health insurance bleed in the way that it has in the past years because this does increase the strains on the public system.</PARA>
<PARA>That does sound to me suspiciously like the present Minister for Health disowning the previous Minister for Health. Senator Richardson has been one who has also recognised that it is not just high income earners for whom private health insurance has an attraction. There is enough disincentive in the public health system for even low income earners to have made the sacrifice to pay those high, unsubsidised fees to private insurance. He said in his speech to the conference last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we must remember is that there are a lot of people in private health insurance who don't have much money. Not everyone who is privately insured is a rich guy, in fact there are a million families that earn less than $40,000 a year who have got private health insurance. Depending on who you believe somewhere being 13-20% are pensioners. . . 30% of those who have got private health insurance earn less than average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the ones who struggle as premiums go up because people leave. People leave because in hard times (and we've had hard economic times here for some time) they find those premiums more difficult to meet, they find that discretionary expenditure more difficult to justify.</PARA>
<PARA>With every word that comes from this minister's lips he disowns the nonsense we were told a few minutes ago by the previous Minister for Health. The plan that the minister has been very up front in putting forward is a three-point plan: an increased Medicare levy for higher income earners, a single bill for in-hospital care for insured patients, and the amalgamation of insurance funds. That is the story he is trying to sell to his divided and confused back bench. The simple fact is that he has some entrenched opposition, and he has described it himself. He has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So I think we, as a party, ought to go back over our resolute opposition to the question of gap insurance. This always brings about shrieks of horror from those who authored the proposal and from those who defended them.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the ones who are making it difficult in caucus at the moment. But the minister has gone on to give this warning about his plan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it is rejected by the government, by the AMA, or by the people then we will all be accepting the private medicine will die, perhaps not so slowly, but an inevitable death over the course of the next decade. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the minister's prediction for the private health system, which is the only thing that enables the public health system to survive at all&mdash;a strong, healthy private system&mdash;if his plan is not accepted. He points out that there is some entrenched opposition, and that entrenched opposition is the ACTU&mdash;he has referred to that publicly, too&mdash;and the Australian Nurses Federation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) is a very nice fellow and, obviously, one of the moderates trying to achieve some changes in the Liberal Party. Nevertheless, the government is very puzzled by the fact that this matter of public importance is before us today. It is strange because it is well known that the proposals of the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) will go to cabinet probably later this week. The opposition is trying to make a political point on this matter by alleging division within the Labor Party before the proposals are presented to cabinet and caucus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first point is that the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) said that our support for Medicare is somehow changed by these proposals. Senator Richardson has made it very clear, time and again, that these proposals will not weaken Medicare; they will strengthen it. The suggestion that these proposals are somehow a move away from Medicare is nonsense. As the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) pointed out in his contribution to this debate, the opposition is the group that has tried to chop away at and undermine the basis of Medicare. The Labor Party has never done that, and Senator Richardson is not doing that. We are very united in our support for Medicare, so let me put that furphy out of the way to start with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that needs to be made is that, contrary to what the honourable member for Moncrieff said, we have recognised the issue of waiting lists in public hospitals.

We were aware of the problem; we made an election promise and we will keep it. So much for that furphy from the honourable member for Moncrieff and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we left with? The opposition has moved a motion against the government even before it knows what will be going forward.

If there is any discussion, it will concern only one part. The other two parts of the proposals are very important and sensible. They will be key proposals for the balance of our health system. Why do I refer to `the balance of our health system'? The honourable member for Moncrieff suggested that the reduction in the number of people with private health insurance had something to do with Medicare. That is not so; it has to do with the way the private health system has been operating, particularly the private health insurance system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has been raised with me by people throughout Australia. Last Friday I was talking to a conference of independent retirees, most of whom have private health insurance. The fundamental problem is that people go into private health insurance and then, when they have to enter a private hospital, think that all their costs will be covered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What are we talking about? We are talking about reform, are we not? The reform that will come in will be directed towards the diagnostic related groups. The health insurance companies will negotiate packages for dealing with specific types of diagnostic related group situations, which will mean that there will be some capping of doctors' fees&mdash;not huge reductions in doctors' fees. There will be some capping in the cases where there are extraordinary charges; that is, where the charges are more than 100 per cent or so above the schedule fee and, in some cases, they are well over 100 per cent above the schedule fee, which is a disgraceful situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast majority of specialists and doctors will not have much to worry about in terms of their income. But there is a small minority who think that, because they are operating in a private hospital, they can charge whatever they like; therefore, health costs are increased. That matter will be dealt with and will be one of the major reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless this matter is dealt with, private health system costs will explode. People might ask: why should the government worry about an explosion in private health system</PARA>
<PARA>costs? The reason is that there is an interrelationship between an explosion in costs in the private health system and the impact on public hospitals and on Medicare. The government simply cannot say, `That is the private system', and ignore the increased costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health package put forward by the opposition before the last election would have been a bonanza for doctors. It would have encouraged them to charge much more than the schedule fee. It would have made the situation much worse and health costs in Australia would have been blown out in an enormous way. Contrary to what the honourable member for Moncrieff said, there is no doubt that the opposition has never come up with any scheme which would in any way cap doctors' fees. Because of that, the opposition has failed. The Richardson scheme is completely different from proposals that the opposition is putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another key issue is the reduction in the number of private health insurance organisations. What is wrong with that? There is no problem with that. A reduction in the number of those organisations will lead to more efficiencies and administrative costs will be reduced. This will mean that the cost of private health insurance will be reduced or will not be increasing.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With people dropping out of the private health insurance system, one of the concerns is that there will be increased costs for those who can least afford it. Those two aspects of the Richardson scheme are clearly very important and very useful and should be supported by the majority of Australians. We expect some opposition from some vested interests, from some doctors, but we do not expect opposition from most Australians who understand these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Richardson has said, he will not ram through government the issue of the additional levy. He said that there will be a full-scale debate in the caucus on this issue and there will probably be a committee to examine it. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), other members of the government, as well as the caucus, will fully participate in this debate, as is the usual process within the Labor Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Chairman, when this bill was debated in this House last month the minister accepted certain coalition amendments to it. Those amendments related to the need for a warrant for telecommunications interceptions in cases of emergency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the normal course of events, the act requires that a warrant be obtained before a signal may be intercepted. The bill sought to waive the warrant requirement in the case of participant monitoring in certain emergency situations. The coalition's amendments required that, where a warrant was not obtained in respect of the initiation of an interception, a warrant should be obtained as soon as practicable afterwards for the interception to be permitted to be continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments resulted in protection of privacy rights and an increase in accountability on the part of law enforcement officers, while recognising the need for law enforcement officers to act swiftly in some cases. The amendments were passed by this House and also by the Senate. However, the Senate has made a small further amendment relating to the coalition amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The normal warrant provisions under the act apply to what are defined as class 1 and class 2 offences. A law enforcement officer cannot apply for a warrant unless the suspected offence would constitute a class 1 or class 2 offence. These are the more serious categories of offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty perceived by the government with the coalition's amendments was the possibility that certain of the emergency situations in which a warrant would not initially be required might not constitute a class 1 or class 2 offence. The government has provided only two examples in this respect. The first is a situation in which a person threatens to kill another or others. In some jurisdictions this would constitute an offence, but would not carry a penalty of as much as seven years imprisonment or more, and would therefore not constitute a class 1 or class 2 offence. The second example is the threat to commit suicide. Attempted suicide is generally no longer an offence in Australian jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was concerned that there may be difficulty in obtaining the warrant to continue the interception as required by the opposition's amendments because the possible offence would not of itself justify the obtaining of a warrant under the normal or non-emergency warrant provisions of the act. In the limited situations where the emergency does not constitute a class 1 or class 2 offence, the government amendments deem the possible offence to constitute such an offence, but for the purpose of the retrospective warrant provisions only. Although there are alternative ways of dealing with these situations, the opposition will not oppose the further amendment. It does not vary the circumstances which constitute an emergency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill seeks to re-enact provisions of the Copyright Amendment Act 1989 in the Copyright Act 1968. The amending bill purported to impose royalties on blank recording tapes in order to recompense copyright holders for home audio taping. In addition, the amending bill introduced a number of other amendments, namely: (a) providing for statutory licence schemes for educational and other institutions to copy respectively television and radio broadcasts and print copyright works; (b) providing a range of performers' rights; (c) clarifying the relationship between the Copyright Act 1968 and the Designs Act 1906 regarding industrially applied artistic works; and (d) streamlining the statutory licence for recording musical works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we heard in the second reading speech on this bill, the imposition of a royalty on blank tapes was challenged in the High Court in the 1993 case of Australian Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd v. the Commonwealth. The challenge was upheld. The court decided, by majority, that the royalty was a tax. Thus, portions of the act were directly invalidated by the court pursuant to section 55 of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chief General Counsel of Australia has advised the government that the invalid provisions are so inextricably linked with the valid provisions that the whole act is invalid. The effect of this bill will be to re-enact all the amendments to the Copyright Act 1968 made by the amending act, except those imposing and relating to the imposition of the blank tape royalty. The validation is retrospective, operating from the respective dates on which the various provisions of the amending act were proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the High Court decision, there has been particular concern amongst those in industry and commerce who are affected by copyright matters that the legal and commercial arrangements put in place as a result of the 1989 amendments may now be in jeopardy. For that reason, the coalition does not oppose this bill. It is important that certainty attach to those arrangements. Those who relied upon the validity of the amending act should be protected from significant disruption to their arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to comment, however, on certain amendments that were proposed by the opposition in relation to the amending act of 1988. Some of those proposals are still of relevance. When the amending bill was introduced in 1988, it was generally supported by the opposition. However, the opposition did move several amendments&mdash;some of which were adopted. Of the two bundles of proposed amendments which were not adopted, one related to the blank tape royalty provisions and is therefore no longer relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other bundle of proposed amendments related to the provisions clarifying the relationship between the Copyright Act 1968 and the Designs Act 1906. The problem these amendments sought to address was that it was thought that a number of industrial designs would slip between the Copyright Act and the Designs Act and they would not be protected. Prior to 1989, claims of copyright and manufactured three dimensional goods were commonly made. Such goods could also generally be protected under the Designs Act. In 1987 the government published a discussion paper that canvassed various options for reform and received submissions from copyright owners and industry. It was determined that copyright protection for three dimensional industrial products would be removed. It was considered that these products should be protected only under the designs legislation or other appropriate law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Designs Law Review Committee report on the law relating to designs had also reached this conclusion in 1973. The 1989 amendments had the general effect that artistic works are not protected by copyright if a design corresponding to the work is the subject of an application for design registration or has been applied to manufactured goods. In other words, a design applied to manufactured goods is not given simultaneous design and copyright protection, subject to certain exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty foreshadowed by the opposition in 1989 concerned the proposed section 77. It provides that where, firstly, copyright subsists in an artistic work, secondly, a corresponding design of that artistic work is applied industrially and articles to which the corresponding design has been applied are sold, and, thirdly, the corresponding design is not registered under the Designs Act, then it is not an infringement of the copyright in the artistic work to reproduce the work on or after the day on which the articles made to the corresponding design are first so sold, let for hire, or offered or exposed for sale or hire. The then shadow Attorney-General, Mr Neil Brown, had advice to the effect that the result of these provisions would be to remove all protection from some industrial designs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now clear that the provision has the greatest potential for injustice where the goods are sold or applied industrially overseas. The loss of Australian intellectual property protection in such a case is noted by the Australian Law Reform Commission in a discussion paper on designs released in April of this year. The commission comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . section 77 in effect denies copyright protection within Australia to the Australian copyright owner in the event of overseas sales or industrialisation by the foreign copyright owner in that jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments proposed by the opposition in 1988 sought to prevent the provisions of that part of the bill from coming into operation until the government reviewed the Designs Act to prevent potential loss of protection. The coalition's concerns over the relationship between the Designs Act and the Copyright Act remain. However, in this instance the coalition has determined that it is necessary to ensure passage of this bill to protect industry and business which relied on the validity of the 1989 amendments. </PARA>

Relevant to the present discussion, it describes questions of overlap between copyright and designs protection as `among the most vexed areas of intellectual property with considerable uncertainty in several key areas'. The opposition looks forward to the Australian Law Reform Commission's report on the Designs Act and a well-considered legislative response by the government. </PARA>

As has been noted by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), the bill's provisions do not effect any change or new initiative. Our normal statement would be that this is much ado about nothing; I suspect this is nothing ado about much. The amendments are directed solely to re-enact all the amendments to the Copyright Act 1968 made by the Copyright Amendments Act 1989 except those imposing and related to the imposition of the blank audiotape royalty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has become necessary because of the decision handed down by the High Court in the case of Australian Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd v. the Commonwealth. This case was concerned with a challenge to the validity of the imposition of a royalty on blank audiotapes. The court held, by majority, that the royalty levied on vendors of blank tapes was a tax. In consequence, it was invalid by reason of non-compliance with section 55 of the constitution. So this means that this bill is purely technical in nature. The invalidity of the provisions of the act is an unexpected and unfortunate result of the High Court challenge to just one part of a raft of significant measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a few comments about the need for copyright laws to keep pace with changes in technology. I know that the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) has turned his attention to these issues. There is a growing importance of intellectual property in the international economy as we move from a commodity based economy to a services based economy. It is a critical time for the copyright community, because technological change will alter the fundamental nature of copyright. We will soon be able to receive films and sound recordings down information highways via cable or satellite. This will mean many changes to the way in which we currently use CDs, videotapes, books, information and entertainment media. The government will continue to work with the copyright community to ensure that the copyright regime is capable of handling these changes, and it is committed to maintaining a copyright regime that is recognised as one of the best in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Copyright Act has already been extensively amended during the life of this government, as the honourable member for Tangney has also mentioned. The amendments reflect the active government attention to the needs of copyright owners and users. The main areas of amendments have included substantially increased piracy penalties; the introduction of performance protection; streamlining of the licences to educational institutions; and explicit extension of copyright protection to computer programs. During this year's election campaign, the government signalled that it would make further considered changes to the Copyright Act, and I understand that my ministerial colleagues have already begun the work on the implementation of those changes. The government will continue to ensure that legislation keeps pace with technological change so that intellectual property is protected. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill seeks to extend the government's One Nation development allowance to benefit the motor vehicle industry and the production side of the print media. Because investments now to qualify for the development allowance were originally excluded, this bill reopens the application period for the allowance which had closed at the end of last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Claimants in these industries seeking to take advantage of the reopened application process for the development allowance will have to meet competitiveness tests set for work practices and input pricing. These tests were waived under the original legislation for projects that could demonstrate a substantial commitment to completion prior to the end of last year, for reasons not unrelated to the timing of the last federal election&mdash;and I will come to that in a moment. The additional allowances provided for in this legislation will otherwise be subject to the provisions of the original development allowance legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition opposed the development allowance from the outset. We will continue to draw attention to its considerable shortcomings as a means of bringing about business investment in this country. In opposing the development allowance, the coalition was particularly concerned about the blatantly political way in which the allowance has been used by Labor to further its re-election prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development allowance was originally featured in the government's One Nation economic statement early last year, which became a large part of the platform on which it contested the most recent federal election. Of course, since the election, that platform has been largely ignored. I refer by way of example to the bulk of the personal income tax cuts that were promised to the Australian people in that statement. All we have left are the dregs of that pseudo-policy, such as the development allowance and the failed pooled development funds and infrastructure bonds initiatives. `Let them eat infrastructure', Labor might well say in the wake of the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the beginning, the development allowance was designed to give the Labor Party a few big ticket investment projects that it could tout during the election as false evidence of a recovery in business investment and a sign of general economic recovery. It was no accident that the deadline for the applications for the development allowance was set at the end of 1992, and that the competitiveness test in the legislation was waived for those projects that were submitted before that magic date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The theory was to entice businesses to get their investment projects out of the top drawer where they had been sitting and into the open where the government could use them for its own short-term, politically expedient ends. Obviously, any prudent business organisation that thought it had a project that might be eligible for the allowance was obliged to rush forward with an application so that it would have the option of taking up the allowance at some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the basis for the government's greatly exaggerated claims of an investment avalanche&mdash;which I am sure you will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;uttered before and during the most recent federal election campaign. Labor touted billion dollar figures as to the supposed sum total of these mythical investment projects. All of this additional investment was supposedly attributable to the actions of the government and a meagre 10 per cent allowance for expenditure on new plant for qualifying projects. No such investment avalanche has taken place and nor would one expect even a trickle to be generated by such a meagre concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that the investment allowance served to do was bring out into the open some of the forward planning of some Australian firms for larger and already conceived investment projects. Most of these projects were well advanced in conception and would have gone ahead anyway. What the development allowance enabled the government to do was take credit for investments that it really had no role in facilitating. That is all that the development allowance has so far contributed to further business investment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The politically motivated nature of the development allowance is amply revealed by the fact that, prior to the last election, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and now Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) was deputised to oversee the administration of the Development Allowance Authority. The man who put his signature on signs all over New South Wales when he was a minister in that state Labor government was an obvious choice for administering Labor's opportunistic development allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was directly involved in the administration of the allowance&mdash;something that one would normally expect to be the purview of what was then the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. Presumably DITAC could not be relied on to give a suitably political focus to the activities of the Development Allowance Authority. Obviously honesty and propriety in DITAC meant it could not be relied on to do Labor's bidding. It is said that the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister had a chart on his wall indicating the progress being made with the various projects that were to be the beneficiaries of the allowance&mdash;perhaps the ultimate example of the process of the government picking winners run amok. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While many of these projects are certainly worthwhile ventures, it must give cause for concern when progress is being individually tracked on the walls of a politician's office. It is hard to believe the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister had such a close personal interest in business investment unless it had some direct benefit to what was then Labor's principal preoccupation: winning the last federal election by hook or by crook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are good reasons for believing the development allowance has not made a significant impact in bringing on additional investment in this country, quite apart from the blatantly political origins of the scheme. At best, it has served to assist projects that would have gone ahead anyway. As already indicated, with the exception of investments provided for in this bill, any applications for the development allowance would have had to have been submitted sometime between February and December 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely unlikely that 10 months is sufficient time to conceive and develop from taws a new $50 million plus investment project&mdash;$50 million being the minimum above which projects were to be considered for the development allowance. Instead, the development allowance promised to merely bring forward projects that would have already been well advanced in conception, if not implementation, before the One Nation statement was handed down some 20 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Labor's point of view, this is exactly what the development allowance was designed to achieve. But if many of these projects were going to go ahead anyway, as we have every reason to believe, then all the government succeeded in doing was giving away revenue to a few select businesses, with no apparent benefit to increased business investment overall. In any event, the benefits to the companies concerned are not particularly great. A once-only tax deduction of 10 per cent of a company's expenditure on qualifying new plant works out at only 3.9c for every dollar spent, under the former company tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hard to believe that such a sum would be decisive in determining the viability of a new project. It would be a serious concern if such a small benefit were to be decisive in the way Labor would have us believe. Projects operating that close to the margin of viability are risky propositions. The government has tried to claim that some projects needed the development allowance to make them viable, which makes one wonder about the quality of the projects that the allowance will support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the features of the development allowance, the $50 million threshold is the aspect that has probably attracted the most criticism. The total capital cost threshold is quite arbitrary and obviously highly distortionary in its effects on investment decisions by firms that might be able to benefit from the allowance. It encourages the vertical integration of production processes for the purpose of claiming the allowance, even though such integration may not be optimal in terms of a particular production process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Highly efficient and productive capital projects which just happen to fall below the $50 million capital cost threshold do not qualify for the allowance. Unfortunately for them, the government is only interested in the big ticket items that pump up the prospective investment statistics and look flash enough for election campaign purposes. The result is a potential misallocation of resources in favour of larger investment projects, at the expense of smaller, potentially more productive projects, and at the cost of overall economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development allowance is in many ways overly restrictive if what one is trying to do is provide a significant measure of support for business investment in this country. Qualifying projects are restricted to those that are deemed by the government to be direct contributors to the traded goods sector. Investment projects in the services or tertiary sector are excluded from any consideration whatsoever. This is part of the cargo cult that has grown up around manufacturing and value adding in the traded goods sector, at the expense of other sectors of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The services sector is in many ways equally productive and it is often in this sector that our comparative advantage as a country lies. But it gets ignored under legislation such as this, largely, one suspects, because of the limited imagination of the people who think up these schemes in the first place. In order for the investment allowance to make any worthwhile contribution to increased business investment in this country, it would need to be much broader in scope, as well as higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme would have to be extended to something like 10 years to really bring about investment projects that otherwise will not see the light of day. That is the planning horizon along which most large investment projects are determined. Most such projects are not put together in the space of 10 months and require certainty and predictability before implementation. `Now you see them, now you don't' tax concessions are not going to have a substantial impact on long-term business investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development allowance would have to be increased to something like 20 per cent to have a significant impact on decisions to proceed with investment projects. If a large number of projects were to be facilitated in such a way, one would need to lower the minimum capital cost threshold to something like $30 million to have a significant impact across the broad spectrum of business investment activity. Such a development allowance, with more liberal eligibility criteria, might have had a worthwhile impact on business investment in Australia. Unfortunately, it would also have been highly distortionary, for reasons I have already indicated, and it would have implicated the government in the process of picking winners to an even greater extent than is already attempted in the relevant legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claims that the development allowance is not about picking winners, yet the legislation has been structured in such a way that it is an inevitable consequence of its operation. The government, by its own admission, is directing investment into certain types of economic activity and into projects of a particular size and being carried out by particular firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development allowance is supposedly designed to benefit projects that pass various competitiveness tests, yet these tests were waived entirely for the first round of applicants, to bring them out into the open ahead of the last election. This begs the question as to why those projects needed special tax breaks if they were already world competitive, as the government would have us believe. Such projects should not require assistance from the Commonwealth in the form of tax breaks that must ultimately be paid for by other taxpayers, who will have to bear a heavier tax burden in consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if these projects are less than world competitive, we should be even less inclined to support them in this way. The then Minister Assisting the Treasurer, in his second reading speech to the Development Allowance Authority Bill last year, said that the development allowance could be used by firms to `negotiate progress against a broad best practice agenda', which suggests that the firms concerned are less than world competitive at the time of the granting of the allowance and still have some way to go before meeting a particular criterion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, this legislation reeks of the now thoroughly discredited practice of Labor attempting to pick winners in industry policy. The government has made it abundantly clear in its own descriptions of the operation of this legislation. In the minister's second reading speech to the original legislation he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Put simply, the development allowance rewards success and represents a conscious rejection of those policies of the past which underwrote loss and failure.</PARA>
<PARA>So this legislation is designed to `reward success'&mdash;the very essence of picking winners. What the minister conveniently forgot is that those policies of the past to which he referred also sought to reward success in much the same way as the development allowance. The fact that those policies of the past ended up underwriting loss and failure was an entirely unintended consequence of those policies. Governments then thought they were backing winners, just as Labor today thinks it is supporting winning projects with these measures. One can only hope that the government is more successful in picking winners this time around than some of its predecessors have been, although its own record in office gives us every reason to be pessimistic on that score. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, taxpayers have no duty, at the insistence of Labor, to underwrite successful or unsuccessful businesses and projects. Successful projects and businesses simply do not need support. Unsuccessful businesses do not deserve such support and should be allowed to fail if that is to be their ultimate fate. The government cannot help attempting to pick winners through legislation such as this. The government is inevitably involved in making decisions as to exactly which projects and firms will become beneficiaries of the development allowance. In so doing, Labor's preferences and judgments will inevitably intrude into the process, so the government cannot help falling into the trap of attempting to pick winners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister said as much last year when speaking to a Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill in this place. He said of the legislation then:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is assistance not about picking winners but about rewarding and encouraging the proven winners, the people who create wealth for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But who decides according to the legislation? Who are the proven winners to be encouraged and rewarded with the likes of the development allowance? It is the government that decides. Hence the chart on the wall of the then parliamentary secretary tracking the winners, but with no apparent regard to the opportunity cost of the benefits bestowed on those so-called winners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor is very fond of selective industry assistance. It is, no doubt, a belief in the effectiveness of such assistance that is partly motivating the government with the development allowance and some of the other One Nation initiatives, such as the pooled development funds and the infrastructure bonds, both of which have been something of a flop. The Industry Commission has made some important criticisms of such assistance in its 1989-90 annual report, criticisms based on the experience of east Asian countries with such assistance, including directed investment. The government could do well to take some of those criticisms into account and embrace some of the more important micro-economic reform proposals that could make a real contribution to increasing the level of business investment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wants to promote investment in Australia, the way to do it is not through the selective conferral of benefits on the particular projects of particular firms. Any such benefits should be general in nature so that all potential investment projects in this country stand to benefit. In this way, there are no distortionary effects on economic activity and everyone is treated equally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that the government could do is get serious about taking some of the costs off business. In particular, our businesses need to be relieved of some of the burdens of government at all levels. When Australian industry is relieved of paying for the special privileges of the few industries and firms favoured by government, Australia will have that much more investment and will be that much more competitive as a result. Unfortunately, the government's most recent budget not only fails to take costs off business but also adds a few new ones just for good measure. That will be the principal legacy of its most recent budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite need to come to the realisation that it is not within the capacity of government to identify investments, businesses or industries that are successful, or likely to remain that way in the future. It is, therefore, not within its capacity to selectively provide assistance to such investments which is in any way going to be helpful to the Australian economy. To the extent that the government gets it wrong, as it is bound to, it will be downright unhelpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering these matters, governments and their bureaucrats have no special insights that are not available to the investors themselves. More commonly, governments are thoroughly ignorant of the marketplace and the legislated demands placed on industry. If governments have no special knowledge in these matters, they have nothing to contribute to the judgments that entrepreneurs already make in a market context on a daily basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the most part, private investors themselves are unsure of the future success of a project with which they may be involved. The knowledge required to make such judgments is dispersed in the marketplace and becomes available to the investor only after the investment has been made and the product or service is marketed. Even then there is no accounting for what shifts will take place in the market, which will completely change the viability of the underlying investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government has no business in underwriting or otherwise selectively contributing to investments made by the private sector. However, there are many things a government can do to help investment in this country. They largely consist of getting out of the way of business and letting it get on with the job of investing and producing. Government should feel free to grant tax concessions to investment projects, businesses and industries. But these benefits must be available across the board so that everyone is treated equally and so that the government does not become involved in directing investment into preferred areas or, even worse, to selected individual firms. The judgments government makes in this context will inevitably prove to be misplaced and will be made at great cost to the people who ultimately have to pay for those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the government is persisting with its development allowance and marginally expanding it after the election campaign is over may suggest that the government is really conducting something more than just a purely political exercise of the type that I have already described. Nevertheless, Labor is still beholden to the nostrums of selective industry assistance that have misled so many governments in the past, both here and abroad. It has not learned the lessons of the past and seems determined to repeat mistakes that have been made by this government and many of its predecessors. Unfortunately, the real costs of this legislation and measures like it will be borne only long after this government is dead and buried. </PARA>

As the law currently stands, these tests could be waived where the project sponsor is able to show that, prior to 1 January 1993, there was substantial commitment to completion of the project.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to listen to the debate and to hear speakers from the opposition talking about governments keeping out of industry and not trying to pick winners. This government has, since 1983 with the float of the dollar, moved this economy from a very inward looking economy based behind tariff walls to one which is now looking out nationally and internationally to the world markets, an economy which for many years was dominated by the conservative parties of Australia who consistently attempted to pick winners and to develop industry and keep industry behind tariff walls. We are paying the price for that today because the restructuring of the Australian economy has certainly been a very grave issue. It has been one that has tested the abilities of the work force in this nation.

That is because the policies of this government have been worked out in conjunction with the ACTU and the working people of Australia, and certainly it is not an easy job. It is certainly a very trying operation for both the government and the bureaucrats&mdash;and for the union leaders to try to explain to their members what the total packages are that are being put into place and why it is that on many occasions we are seeing thousands of jobs disappearing in one sector and slowly being developed in another sector. </PARA>

Our competitors in South-East Asia are attracting investment from large industries and will continue to do so because they are offering great incentives for those companies to go into those areas. Malaysia is one country which is booming because of the investment flowing into that country. </PARA>

One of the reasons we have not attracted investment is that the economy there is based on the old idea that we will go on forever behind tariff walls. We are now facing up to reality, and the reality is that, while we live in that region, we are still paying the market price for telecommunications. No industry operating in the Latrobe Valley can send a fax for the cost of a local call; we have to pay distance rates because of our distance from Melbourne. Likewise, the transport industry is affected by fuel prices, with the market reflecting the price of fuel. Cartage rates to my electorate also reflect the price of fuel. However, when we look at the reverse situation, nothing reflects. The cost of electricity to a company in my region is exactly the same as it is for a company in a National Party area in Mildura or in Portland in the western district. </PARA>

There are half a dozen areas of Australia with the sort of magnificent natural resources that can match it with South-East Asia in attracting investment. We need to remove any impediments that would stop industries from assessing an area as having the economic and structural facilities necessary to attract their investment. And what sort of things are they looking at? Firstly, as the companies themselves tell us, gas, fuel and electricity prices are three of the major inputs to any very large manufacturing operation. Very large operators use a lot of power and energy and&mdash;in the case of the paper industry&mdash;a lot of gas. In our region, where we are only hundreds of yards from a natural resource&mdash;in fact, we have a power station sitting right on top of the natural resource&mdash;we are expected to pay for transmission costs to other parts of the nation. There is no competitive advantage with which our region can approach these large companies. When they do, they say, `Well, the problem is that there is no advantage in going to your area because you are still asking us to pay the same prices for your fuel'. </PARA>

That difference will be the gas prices, petrol prices and labour costs that are available to industry in those regions. The federal government, through its OLMA committee, recently funded a detailed study by the Symes Business College of Monash University College Gippsland. It surveyed a large number of companies as to what they regarded as the main impediments to investing in our region, and the results were very interesting. </PARA>

That was the last time we had a dispute which cost any time in labour, but we have to get out and sell that message. </PARA>

That paper study is running into some problems with the conservative government in New South Wales. There are also some bad signals coming from Victoria to the effect that the very people who want to hide behind tariff walls&mdash;in this case it is not so much a tariff wall as a subsidy to another part of the state&mdash;are the same people who are starting to buck and kick. In other words, the National Party rump of the conservatives are saying to the Liberals, `You need our vote, so do not touch our subsidies'. That is a very detrimental policy for Australia today when we are in direct competition with some of the biggest investment areas of South-East Asia. </PARA>

We need to work hard to remove them.

Those are not the sorts of costs that these industries can afford to carry. They are not the sorts of costs that we can afford to impose upon them if we want to attract investment into this nation because our competitors for this type of investment are not Australian, they are South-East Asian competitors.

The last thing that I want to say&mdash;I impress this upon everybody&mdash;is that I have seen the 5,000 people in my area who have suffered from the restructure&mdash;I have seen them pay the price to this point in time&mdash;but I still have not seen industry coming in to replace the 5,000 jobs that were lost.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1993 is flawed legislation. This is the second set of amendments in just 12 months to what has been, arguably, another One Nation idea that did not make the grade. It is estimated that this set of amendments will cost $9 million in 1994-95, $11 million in 1995-96 and $14 million in 1996-97. While the coalition is not opposing this bill, there is little evidence that the development allowance has lifted the amount of private investment, although it may act to bring forward some expenditure. There was also no evidence that manufacturing employment has been boosted by the development allowance or by any other government promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the One Nation statement should really have been called the One Job statement. The development allowance was really aimed at trying to make the Prime  Minister (Mr Keating) and his party look good in the lead-up to the March election. Sadly, that is one of the aims which the development allowance did apparently help to achieve. Who can forget the Prime Minister's boast?  He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So we have got the growth, we have got the investment sitting there, 130 billion, enormous, an absolute avalanche, and once it starts to go, the economy starts to move. That's what it's all about.</PARA>
<PARA>In the same extraordinary bout of campaign fever at a 4 March doorstop, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . even if a modest proportion of them goes, it is going to be a huge avalanche of investment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) was a bit close to the truth when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well I think I said earlier it won't be only a trickle, it will be a steady stream.</PARA>
<PARA>The investment we had sitting there, in reality, was $27 billion in capital value and nearly $22.5 billion in plant at the time of the DAA's fifth quarterly report. While that is a healthy figure, it is only a fraction of the amount that the Prime Minister was touting as a fait accompli in March. Honourable members should also note the view of the Australian Mining Industry Council Executive Director, Lauchlan McIntosh. He said that his industry was already investing $5 billion or $6 billion a year, which should add up to, in the long term, about the same amount likely to be spent on mining under the development allowance. In other words, the development allowance has done little to create investment that would not, under normal circumstances, have gone ahead in the mining industry anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development allowance has largely failed to stimulate private investment. Business investment this financial year is forecast to be only just above its 1989-90 level, after three years in the doldrums. The forecast for business investment growth for one-quarter of one per cent is not what we would call a robust recovery. It also means that the government's pump-priming attempt in February 1992 has had little effect. The Prime Minister's claim that Australia will benefit from an avalanche of investment looks very dubious when we consider that virtually every big Australian company with an eye for the commercial opportunity would have registered every possible project before the development allowance deadline. That means that at least some of the projects which are the subject of the DAA applications will never see the light of day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process involved in claiming the development allowance has basically been three steps. The first step is an application for registration. In the case of this amendment, application for the development allowance on certain projects in the motor vehicle and print media industries will be accepted until the 29th day after this bill has received royal assent. Step two of the process is for the Development Allowance Authority to satisfy itself that the projects meet the development allowance criteria and grant registration. Up to 30 September, some 121 projects had been registered&mdash;up to half of them on a conditional basis for reasons the DAA has not given. A total of 16 applications have been rejected for reasons including failure to meet the $50 million investment threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That $50 million threshold seems strangely at odds with the feel-good exercise conducted by the government in the wake of the McKinsey report into emerging exporters. That report has been waved around by everyone in government&mdash;from the Prime Minister down&mdash;as if it were the saviour of Australian exporting. What the report actually found was that there were 700 small- to medium-sized firms emerging as exporters and that 6,200 similar firms did not export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not knocking the achievement of the 10 per cent of firms which have succeeded in becoming exporters or knocking those among the 90 per cent which were working towards import replacement. What I am saying is that with all the opportunities that Australia has had over the last 10 years or so, it is a damning indictment of the government policies that there are not more than 700 small- to medium-sized firms succeeding in exporting. Even though the small- to medium-sized enterprises have been touted by the government as the future direction for Australian exporting, policies such as the development allowance do absolutely nothing for these businesses. The $50 million investment threshold was relaxed a little in the first round of amendments to the development allowance when changes were made to allow applicants to aggregate two or more joint venture projects or specified projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to recap, the first thing that is wrong with the development allowance is that it is expected to cost Australian taxpayers approximately $40 million in 1994-95 and $70 million in 1995-96. However, there is little evidence that this has been spent on investment which would not otherwise have taken place. The second thing that is wrong with the development allowance is the fact that it is directed solely at big business. It not only discriminates against the very businesses which are supposed to be providing Australia with the way out of the economic quagmire, but it also discriminates against particular industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument in the original, flawed Development Allowance Authority Act was that the allowance would apply to only those industries where there was an effective rate of assistance of 10 per cent or less. Yet we had the Prime Minister apparently suffering a rush of blood to the head during the election campaign and deciding that the allowance should be extended to the motor vehicle industry. Quite clearly, this industry has an effective rate of assistance of more than 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not arguing that the motor vehicle industry should not be included in the development allowance. I am saying that, if an exception is to be made for one industry, why not for all industries? This selective discrimination makes the Development Allowance Authority Act look more and more like it was thrown together at a pre-election brainstorming session than carefully constructed as a focused piece of industry policy. Another flaw in the government's approach to business investment is that it largely fails to achieve one of the supposed aims of the One Nation policy, which is jobs growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I earlier discussed the first two steps that projects must go through to obtain the 10 per cent deduction under the development allowance. The third step is for registered projects to obtain pre-qualifying certificates, which the businesses concerned can then present to the Australian Taxation Office as proof that they have satisfied the criteria for the development allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its September quarterly report, the Development Allowance Authority stated that it had issued four pre-qualifying certificates. Under the original terms of the DAA Act, projects must have begun by 30 June 1996. So either these projects are slow getting going and we will see the Prime Minister's avalanche of activity which should by then be a well established recovery or many of them will never take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is undoubtedly hoping there is a wave of activity in late 1995 and the first half of 1996, accompanied by a surge in employment. After all, the next federal election is due by March 1996. The result of this apparently very long lead-time is that, like other government promises, the development allowance has failed to make a dent in our unacceptably high unemployment levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, since the `One Nation, One Job' statement was launched in February 1992, employment in manufacturing has fallen. What is more, business expectations published recently by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that manufacturers expect to continue shedding jobs in both the short term and medium term. Australia's investment and jobless situation are catastrophes for the people this government has forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we do not oppose these amendments, it is patently clear that, if we ever see any benefit from the development allowance, it will be too late to save thousands of Australians from the pain and indignity of joining the growing queue of long-term unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the beginning of the development assistance scheme. On 26 February 1992, in its One Nation statement, the government came forward with a plan to supplement the accelerated depreciation allowance for plant and equipment. In its One Nation statement, the government said that the development assistance would be at the rate of 10 per cent and allowed when plant is first installed ready for use. It would be modelled broadly on the investment allowance that operated between 1976 and 1985; and to be eligible for this allowance projects must involve a total capital cost of $50 million or more and must be completed within a tight time frame. The government said that the allowance would be available only on the plant and equipment component of the investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its One Nation policy, the government proposed an extension of the allowance because it felt somewhat threatened by the industry sensitive policies developed by the opposition. In order to stand squarely with industry, the government firstly introduced an acceleration of the appreciation allowance and then the development allowance to supplement what it thought would be increased investment and job opportunities in manufacturing industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government went on in its One Nation statement to indicate that the first criteria intended to identify projects must relate to the absence of any substantial assistance or protection. Looking at the bill, the substantial assistance or protection criteria has been dumped completely. The government has chosen to support one of the highly protected industries in Australia, namely, the automobile industry. So other significant factors came into play during the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second criteria relates to the positive facilitation of projects by state and local governments as a way of locking people in. The third criteria is that employers and employees must be committed to management and industrial relations arrangements which promote the achievement of world best practice. The government has designated some queer criteria for the development allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its One Nation statement, the government said that Mr Bill Scales, chairperson, then Chief Executive, of the Automotive Industry Authority, would report to the government within 30 days, advising on how best to elaborate upon the criteria set out. In other words, the government had an idea which it did not know how to put into action, so it asked somebody else to look at it on its behalf. In the One Nation statement, the government said that Mr Bill Scales would determine the most appropriate institutional arrangements for administering the development allowance. So there was the rush of blood to the head&mdash;`We have a good idea which we do not know how to implement, and these are the industries to which the allowance will apply. Then we will consider the most appropriate institutional arrangements for getting the funds to those eligible businesses'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claimed that the most likely industries to produce results for Australia were those which add value to our rich resource base. These included: the food fibre and mineral processing industries; the waste and environmental management technologies; scientific and medical equipment; health services; pulp and paper; and tourism and education. So the government looked across the spectrum of where it was encouraging industrial research and development and said, `Those are the types of industries that we think should have the advantage of the development allowance'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government devised three criteria, appointed somebody to develop them and said, `These are the industries to which these criteria will apply'. That is a strange way for a government to make decisions&mdash;no investigation and proper designation of the benefits and, ultimately, the cost and advantage to the Australian community. It is wrong to throw money at industries in the hope of obtaining results. It is like the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) throwing money at sporting and community groups, hoping to produce results. It is exactly the same parallel and the purposes are exactly the same, nothing more and nothing less&mdash;to gain a political result. No economic objective and criteria were laid down to produce a measurable result. This bill is a purely political program, like the sports program administered by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now Mr Bill Scales, the Chief Executive of the Automotive Industry Authority, is trying to dress up the development allowance and make it look good. Of course industry will accept this money. For the last three years things have been so desperate in manufacturing industries that those industries will rush for an opportunity for a little relief, for a little succour from this government which has constantly slammed these industries with increasing costs and increasingly anti-competitive decisions, foisted upon the industries in such a way that they have been the big losers of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Australian community has suffered. The government, in foisting bad news on manufacturing industries, has lost jobs in the economy. It now holds out a carrot of three dot points on a poorly enunciated criteria. The government will appoint somebody to elaborate on the criteria and will nominate the industries to which these criteria apply. That is a political program like the one that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories ran. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost to the Australian community of the development allowance is going to be $40 million in 1994-95 and about $70 million in 1995-96. This legislation extends from those original resource based industries with the criteria that there must be an absence of any substantial assistance or protection; that the projects must be facilitated by state and local governments; and employers and employees must be committed to management and industrial relation arrangements which promote the achievement of world best practice. Those criteria seem to have gone out of the window in the current legislation where the government moves to apply the same criteria to the automobile and print industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can look at the recent figures of the Australian automobile manufacturers and component manufacturers and see that there is a fair bit of good news in the community&mdash;at least, that is what the manufacturers are saying. At a time when it appears that the automobile and component manufacturing industries are having a rather good time&mdash;and the November figures indicate that there is an increase in sales&mdash;the government is going to apply this little development incentive. It is just like the things that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has done. We do not know whether people want it or not, but the government is going to give it to them whether or not they deserve it. Maybe it has got more to do with statements over the last 12 or 18 months by people such as Bob Johnston of Toyota, who slammed the coalition's Fightback program. Perhaps that is the real criteria that is being used here to make these decisions. Maybe it has got a lot to do with the CEO of Ford who, at a critical time, made statements about whether or not the coalition's policies on protection and support for industry would actually work. Maybe that is what the government is about, because I notice that Mr Johnston has been appointed to a fairly prestigious position. That could also be part of the process of payback&mdash;</PARA>

The government is in the process of paying out some friends in the automobile and print industries for assistance during the election campaign.

It is the wrong way to make decisions and to produce the results that the government claims it will achieve in Australia. Where does this finish? Those who supported the government before the election are to be bankrolled. Those who opposed the government are abused and attacked by the Prime Minister and get no consideration. That is a strange way of producing the best results for Australian industry. If this legislation were used properly it could be of benefit to all Australian manufacturing industries, but that has not happened; it is selective and poorly thought through. The beneficiaries are going to be those who spoke out in support of the government during the election campaign. On principle, this legislation should be opposed.

Unfortunately, I was not here to listen to all the speakers today, but I was here to listen to the very ungracious speech of the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), and I will pick up some of the points that he made. He talked very disparagingly about Mr Bob Johnston of Toyota. He also mentioned the Ford company but did not name anyone.

In the real world, do those opposite think that people like Mr Bob Johnston would sell out their principles for a couple of dollars for their industry? The fact is it does not happen. The automotive industry, like the people of Australia, made up its mind who it thought was better suited to lead the country for the next three years. I can understand a bit of sour grapes from those opposite. The opposition went into the election campaign with this huge tax slug it was going to put on everybody.

I do not know where he has been for the last three months, but an extra 100,000 jobs have been created, mainly in the private sector. The bad news for him, the Liberal Party and the National Party is that that will accelerate as the recovery gathers strength. The honourable member for Mitchell also talked about the print industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition amendment in the Senate inserted clause 6 into this bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would significantly complicate the task of administering the scheme as a project is defined in part by whether expenditure passes the $50 million threshold test.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition argued that the existing allowance discriminates against small projects in favour of large ones. This is precisely the policy intent. The allowance was introduced as part of the One Nation statement, as a target incentive to encourage large, and internationally competitive, projects to help get the economy moving again. By removing the $50 million threshold for projects in the motor vehicle industry and the print production facilities in the print media, the bias would be moved from large versus small projects to small projects in these two industries as against small projects in other industries. There does not appear to be any good reason why small projects in these sectors should be favoured over small projects in all other sectors. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not many print organisations in Australia can generate a project of $50 million, apart from the big spenders, including Mr Black&mdash;through the vehicle of the Fairfax press&mdash;and Mr Murdoch. They stand to be the big gainers. Whilst it might be true, as the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said, that those papers editorialised in favour of the coalition to some extent during the last election campaign, it can also be said that journalists&mdash;who, Mr Conrad Black is at pains to explain, are not directed by him; and Mr Murdoch says that on occasions also&mdash;were not necessarily quite as generous. The fact that editorials, which only politicians and the more erudite in the community read, might have gone one way means not a thing in the context of an election campaign. The closest that most of the population gets to reading the editorial pages is looking at the cartoons&mdash;political cartoons in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate amendment to this bill seeks to redress the move away from any egalitarianism. It is very selective. It can be of benefit only to the big operators. I would have thought our friends from the loony left on the other side might have been more vociferous in that matter. We hear quite regularly that they are worried about the concentration of media ownership, but they let something like this go.

The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) will not answer that one. What about the other service industries we ought to be encouraging? The government is limiting the industries, but the hurdle which those industries have to jump over to be eligible is $50 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at those industries most likely to be eligible. The applications are in. I understand what the Assistant Treasurer says about that. I know that the applications are in. Over 100 applicants have tried to jump into the queue to say, `We will fit the criteria'. But those that are most likely to fit the criteria are those that have invested over $50 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the print industry a very small number of people are truly eligible to fulfil the criteria. I ask the Assistant Treasurer: who are they run by? The opposition cannot be blamed for being suspicious. The government is prepared to bend the rules to allow a non-Australian, a former Australian&mdash;Rupert Murdoch&mdash;to have favoured treatment that no other person has ever had in the history of the control of Australia's print media. The government is prepared to bend all sorts of rules&mdash;in return for favours, one can only suspect&mdash;for Rupert Murdoch because he was formerly an Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most likely beneficiaries of this process is News Ltd. I do not mind if the rules apply across the board and the $50 million bar is removed so that those who are doing the best can get the money, but this does smack of favoured treatment. The whole nation has been enlightened by the discussions that took place between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Mr Black on whether it was 15 per cent, 25 per cent, 30 per cent or 35 per cent, as Mr Black said. Mr Black said that he had a commitment for 35 per cent, but the Prime Minister said, `No, we just talked about that; it was not a commitment at all, but we had a commitment for 25 per cent'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is prepared to deal with people who are not Australian nationals in this important industry and is prepared to give them all sorts of favoured treatment in the control of their enterprise but at the same time it is throwing taxpayers' dollars after them. I do not understand the way those in the government think. The great upstanding Labor Party is the great upholder of Australian traditions and the rights of the working men, but it does not care about them; all it wants is to see its name in print on the front page. That is the way the Prime Minister operates; he is a front page reader. He looks at the headlines and nothing else. That is the way he runs this nation. If he is winning in the headlines he is winning and that is all he thinks about. I do not think that that way of running the nation is good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really believe that government members have it completely wrong. The firms that will do well out of this process are not owned or managed by Australians. The fact of the matter is that in the print media Murdoch and Black will be the big winners. I will read to the chamber what the Assistant Treasurer said as I would like the community to understand what is implied here. As if it were not enough to apply it to the place of print, the Assistant Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the printing unit would include the facilities that control and operate the airconditioning plant in the building that houses the printing facility. This is a technical requirement of modern printing facilities. Additionally, the printing unit would typically include the system that manages the collection and disposal of waste material, as well as the system that determines the rate of ink flows, the speed of the presses, and the rostering of printing staff.</PARA>
<PARA>How broad do those opposite want to make it? Why do they not include the development allowance for the Harbour Bridge as well, just in case somebody from the printing industry walks over it? The government has made it as broad as it possibly can to include everything that opens and shuts. I think this is wrong. I have mentioned the fact that the government is prepared to favour non-Australians. I do not mind that. I do not mind competition. I like competition. But we should make it fair for everybody to have a go&mdash;Australians as well as non-Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue that I would like to look at is the automobile industry. I would like the Assistant Treasurer to answer this question because he knows about the applications or could gain access to them. It is widely spoken about in Australian manufacturing industries that, as a result of the huge, recent investment by the Toyota company in plant and equipment, it is likely to benefit by $20 million.

For them to come to Australia and throw an iron into the fire of Australian politics and to have the Prime Minister, as an Australian leader, pick up comfort from a visiting Japanese businessman and say, `This is the way we need to go because this man says so; we do not need to follow our national ideas in this industry' is somewhat distasteful. </PARA>

We want to encourage the process of meeting targets. Why can those component manufacturers not join that process? If they are good, why can they not participate as well?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) picked up the point that firms with proposals under $50 million a year cannot participate in this scheme. The simple fact is that they can participate because this bill allows aggregation. So a number of related industries&mdash;it might be the automotive industry; it might be the print industry&mdash;can put forward a joint venture that can exceed $50 million and be eligible for the allowance. The honourable member for Mitchell also spoke about limited application. This bill does not give the development allowance to two industries but rather adds two industries to the mining, manufacturing and energy sectors, which are already covered by the original bill&mdash;in actual fact, the traded goods sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member went back to the print issue and was ungracious enough to say that Conrad Black and Mr Murdoch may have advantaged the Labor Party in the last federal election. All I can say is that the headlines and editorials&mdash;for anybody who wants to scan those written during that period&mdash;certainly did not favour the Labor Party. I noticed that he did not mention three papers&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adelaide Advertiser</EMPHASIS> and the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>. They come from the three states where the Labor Party lost seats. During the election campaign, those papers provided some of the worst journalism, some of the worst editorials and some of the worst layouts of papers one would ever come cross, but I notice he did not complain about those. They were absent from this wide, sweeping criticism of the print media being onside. The honourable member for Curtin would understand that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, in the two years leading up to the last election and since, has run a completely anti-government line. It never has a good word to say about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The cartoons and the editorials are always against him and always against the Labor Party. So it does not surprise me that he did not mention the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, which would be eligible for this allowance, or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adelaide Advertiser</EMPHASIS> and the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

Given a whole series of events, including the revelations by Mr Conrad Black to which the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and I referred earlier, it is a reasonable assumption to make.

The government had a holiday from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> for eight years while its colleagues in the state, whom the Assistant Treasurer knows and refuses to acknowledge in this place, bled that state dry under the most reprehensible circumstances and with the connivance of the then Prime Minister. </PARA>

In this session 50 per cent of all legislation has gone through the people's house under the guillotine. The Assistant Treasurer grizzles about the fact that it might be applied in the Western Australian upper house as well as the lower house for two bills only!

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the amount of grant payable in relation to the notional full-year claim were equal to the sum of the grant paid or payable in relation to the first-half claim and the grant paid or payable in relation to the balance-year claim; and . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is clause 25 which relates to proposed new subsection (13)(b) of section 38. It is an example of how complex legislative drafting becomes in order to deliver its purpose. I believe that draftsmen need to be reminded from time to time of the need for as much plain English drafting as possible in the preparation of legislation for consideration by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of these amendments is to introduce three new and welcome amendments. Firstly, the bill will exclude from eligibility for export market development grants claimants with criminal convictions under the Corporations Law or in respect of serious fraud. Secondly, it will exclude from the scheme those businesses the future viability of which is tenuous in terms of their solvency. Thirdly, it will permit businesses to lodge half-yearly claims as a method of assisting cash flows in the early stages of export development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment seems to me to be overdue and, indeed, could well be considered a fault in the earlier drafting of the principal act. That nothing has been done until now to address this issue is almost negligent and one can but speculate on the number of claims paid that ought not to have been paid. For there not to have been a provision of the nature now proposed in my view represents an unacceptable level of risk management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, while accepting that the amendment now before us seeks to address the issue of fraud, I am suggesting that further elaboration and clarification are required. I refer specifically to proposed section 11YA(1)(a) and (b) in respect of the reference to convictions wherein it is implied that a claimant would be disqualified from making a claim if convicted of an offence committed overseas. There is no certainty, however, in the bill as to the mechanisms that will serve to guard against false claims made by claimants convicted of an offence overseas. In my opinion, grant applications should include a requirement for all applicants to declare whether they have corporate or other forms of commercial interests overseas and the nature of that interest. Passport details would also be appropriate so as to permit proper inquiry to be made and to ensure a false statement is not included in the application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the bill deals with claimants convicted of offences here in Australia, but I ask that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay), in summing up, address the question of the mechanisms in the bill relating to those who have committed offences overseas in terms of EMDG eligibility. In my view, protection against fraud should occupy a high profile and measures need to be included consistent with the provisions of privacy legislation to ensure that only fit and proper persons have access to the grant program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the second proposed amendment, that of disallowing insolvent firms from making claims, I have no objection. As with the first proposed amendment, the third is, in my view, a measure that ought to have been incorporated in the principal act from day one. That the government has decided only now to facilitate the entry of new firms into the export market by allowing claims to be made on a six monthly basis instead of annually is a real breakthrough and I welcome that breakthrough. However, after the events of the last week or so over the ineptitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the international arena that saw the potential for and an actual disruption to trade between Australia and Malaysia, a trade mostly conducted by the small business sector, we should hardly be surprised that this legislation has received only cursory attention as it passes its way through the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is guilty on four counts in relation to causing a major breakdown in the relations between Australia and Malaysia: firstly, in making his public outburst in Seattle; secondly, in wearing as a badge of honour that he had gone out on a limb against Prime Minister Mahathir; thirdly, by sending a disastrous letter which did nothing to calm the dispute and lead to a solution; and, fourthly, by delaying providing an affirmation of regret through diplomatic channels to Malaysia until some 16 days after the original event. On all four counts, Prime Minister Keating jeopardised Australian trade with Malaysia&mdash;unnecessarily, in an unacceptable way and in a way which members of the government were severely embarrassed about. However, we perhaps should not have expected much different from a Prime Minister who loses control of his tongue. As I said at the time, the tongue of Keating created the problem and the tongue of Keating should have moved a whole lot more quickly to resolve the specific problem with Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to work a great deal harder on building up a more comprehensive and in-depth bilateral relationship with Malaysia with a better understanding in both directions between Australia and Malaysia and, in the broad, between Australia and modern Asia. Frankly&mdash;not that I choose to dwell on this, but it is in part relevant to the Export Market Development Grants Legislation Amendment Bill&mdash;the Prime Minister is paying a price for not having made working visits more frequently to modern Asia over the years. Yes, he went to Europe, Russia and the Northern Hemisphere a great deal, but it is a matter of public record that he had to be dragged screaming to visit Japan by the then Prime Minister Bob Hawke and that he has made very few working visits to Asia compared to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who has visited just about every ASEAN country and many other Asian countries. I have now been on working visits to some 19 Asian countries, including places beyond the bright lights such as Bhutan, Bangladesh and Burma, all countries which Australia should have some knowledge of and some working relationship with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is apparent to me as well as to the small business community that the government has simply ignored the role that small business plays in the Australian economy to a large extent. It has ignored the centrality of the small business sector to Australia's export culture and, as a result, the small business sector has been dealt with badly by this government. For starters, the last budget hit the cost structure of the small business sector through ill-conceived increases in the fuel tax and sales tax areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Dawson correctly points out, it has been kneecapped in many ways with its cost of transport to port for export of product from Australia, especially from inland Australia. Indeed, the fuel tax hike and sales tax hike are costing small business in all directions. I used to wonder how the government could justify on the one hand making grants to exporters by virtue of the raft of EMDG legislation that seeks to improve export opportunities while, on the other, turning around and contributing to increases in their business overheads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because Australian exporters continue to be constrained by questionable economic policies, the government feels incumbent to expiate the guilt it feels towards exporters through amendments of this kind and improvements with the EMDG scheme. It is, in my view, futile for the government to argue the significance of the act and its amendments over the last 20 years or so. It is futile because in other more relevant, more appropriate policy contexts the grants that are available would be unnecessary simply because the economic policies in place would satisfy many of the prerequisites to export competition. It is unbelievable that this country levies a tax on exports, by virtue of the structure of sales tax, of some $1 billion to $2 billion, placing our exporters at a disadvantage on the very unlevel international playing field even before the first container leaves the Australian port. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Export is about international competitiveness. It is true that the EMDG legislation provides assistance to exporters, but it is not the be-all and end-all. The policies of the former Treasurer, the current Prime Minister, which the present Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) clearly is under pressure to maintain, together with the inflexibility of Australian wages policy, have had an adverse impact on the competitiveness of Australia's export opportunities. The EMDG legislation, by its very existence, seeks to address the effect of these policy shortcomings but, clearly, in the face of current policy, any benefits that accrue to the exporter are submerged in the morass of failed government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another more recent addition to the difficulties of competitiveness. Not only does small business have to confront the government's burdensome economic and infrastructure policies, but it also now has to grapple with the potential damage to overseas markets caused by those remarks of the Prime Minister which I referred to earlier. However, since there is a limited possibility of our witnessing a bolt of lightning on the road to Damascus in terms of innovative economic strategies that might redress these shortcomings, there is, in my view, a need for a major overhaul of this legislation in order to fulfil what it originally sought to accomplish and that is, in the words of Dr Jim Cairns, a former trade minister, to give `particular encouragement to small- and medium-sized firms to become involved in exporting'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose the export market development grant amendments before the House. However, I do seek clarification on the particular question that, where a crime or fraud involving an Australian applicant occurs overseas, there be mechanisms in the bill to apply the same circumstance and criteria as would apply if the fraud or crime for which the person is convicted is committed here in Australia. I look forward to a response on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House is considering this legislation at a very critical time for world trade. There is no such thing as a level playing field; I have said that categorically. The answer to the question of whether the playing field becomes more tilted or less tilted appears to be going right down to the wire as we approach the deadline of 15 December&mdash;which is 48 hours away our time, but on Washington time we have a few more hours on top of that. Yet, in the detailed endgame of the Uruguay Round, there has been a savage twist which will impact heavily on Australian grain growers and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That impact has been detailed in part by me and also in a statement made by the Grains Council of Australia. The statement by the Grains Council refers to the sabotaging of aspects of the Blair House accord to help accommodate an agreement between Europe and the United States&mdash;more particularly between France and the United States. Whilst some would argue that the core of the agreement is still in place, so savage is the adjustment that Australian grain growers face a good deal of agony arising from the outcome of the negotiation as it now stands, although there may be some further last-minute changes. I quote from the statement of the Grains Council of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changing the basis for commencing the volume and value cuts in wheat export subsidies from the original Blair House deal will mean that there will be an extra 8 and 7.5 MT of EC and US subsidised wheat which could be legitimately sold onto the market supported by an extra $US700 M&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly the value cuts which would have commenced under the Blair House deal from 1.783 Bill ECU's and $US531.9 will now `step-off' from  $US850 M and 2.3 Bill ECU's for the US and EC respectively.</PARA>

<PARA>The Grains Council has charted part of the situation arising from the endgame of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. It is chilling news for Australian grain growers that, as we head towards the finish line, they are going to see their markets subjected to more subsidised grain from the Northern Hemisphere&mdash;be it US or Europe&mdash;with disastrous consequences for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the core aspects of Blair House cut in, and they represent welcome reductions in the level of subsidisation. On balance, there are benefits for Australia and Australian agriculture in reaching a proper agreement. Even if the Blair House accord goes forward, it is a great pity that to date the government has not been able to secure much in the way of increased market share to help counterbalance the high cost to Australia of adjustments to the Blair House accord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge certainly rests with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade (Senator Cook) to see that the so-called voluntary quotas and agreements restraining trading arrangements between Australia and the United States&mdash;for example, with beef&mdash;and between Australia and other countries are exposed for what they are: methods of backdoor protection on the edge of GATT. While in one sense they are legal, in another sense they beg the question of how fair dinkum some of the major trading countries in the Northern Hemisphere are about reaching free trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Export Market Development Grants Legislation Amendment Bill is some 19 pages of amendments accompanied by eight pages of blank paper&mdash;the bad luck of the binding. In the broad, it is legislation which heads in the right direction. It is legislation which tightens up certain critical aspects of the export market development grants scheme and which hopefully will eliminate any fraudulent application or any situation where applicants might not be fit and proper persons to succeed with an export market development grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an area of activity which needs to be rigorously monitored to ensure the performance of the program against its objectives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the whole thrust of Australian trade activity and policy we must also remind ourselves of the need for tough fair trade criteria. Not only are we entitled to have an export market development grants scheme which is focused and performs; we should also have absolutely adequate anti-dumping laws and labelling laws, an absolutely adequate system of quarantine inspection, a revamping of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to make sure it works more efficiently, with lower costs&mdash;and without the travel rorts exposed by Senator Brownhill, Senator O'Chee, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) and others referred to in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today&mdash;and a National Food Authority with something more than the two inspectors, which it had up until recently, looking at the quality of food that is coming into Australia. </PARA>

This bill amends the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974, which established the export market development program. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> The purpose of this bill is to amend that act to do three things. It seeks to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) exclude from eligibility persons with criminal convictions under the Corporations Law, or in respect of serious fraud, and certain claimants under schemes of arrangement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) effect a number of "technical" amendments . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to make some comments in respect of the first two areas and then make some general comments in respect of Australia's export success in recent times. As I have said, one aspect of this bill seeks to exclude from eligibility persons with criminal convictions under the Corporations Law, or in respect of serious fraud, and certain claimants under schemes of arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) made the following comment in his second reading speech, which underlies the basis of this aspect of the legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is considered that the integrity of the scheme is at risk where it allows convicted persons access to public funds. The bill does not prevent persons with minor convictions from obtaining grants, only those who have been convicted of more serious offences under the Corporations Law, or in respect of fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is an appropriate basis on which to rest this particular aspect of an export market development regime. I draw the House's attention to the ineligibility period, which is outlined in clause 10 of the bill. That clause defines an ineligibility period and states that a person convicted of an offence is subsequently rendered eligible to apply after a period of five years. The ineligibility period, as defined in the clause, is the period starting when the person was convicted and ending five years after the conviction; or, if the person was sentenced to imprisonment, five years after the person's release from prison. Although not precisely analogous, it is consistent with the spirit of expunging criminal records which we have seen in various state enactments over recent years. It has the effect that a person who has fallen foul of the law is not rendered ineligible to make an application under the development grants program for ever and a day. I think that strikes a sensible balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area of amendment in this bill seeks to assist the cash flow of emerging exporters by providing them with the facility to lodge claims for grant on a half yearly basis. I refer again to the minister's second reading speech, where he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . half yearly claims lodgment is seen as a very practical method of assisting exporters' cash flow in the early stages of overseas market development. The scheme has operated very successfully for 19 years, with the only significant criticism being the delay between incurring expenditure by the exporter, and the payment of the grant. This bill provides for earlier payment of grants based on the provision to lodge half yearly claims in respect of exporters' first three full grant years . . . A great strength of the scheme is the freedom it affords exporters to make judgments as to the activities they wish to pursue, and the markets they wish to target.</PARA>
<PARA>I noticed before the dinner break that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in his comments on this bill indicated the opposition's support for that particular measure. I am very pleased to hear it is supported, and I believe that this aspect of the amendment bill will ensure another government measure for emerging exporters, helping to ensure that our success as an exporting country continues to grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move from those particular points to make some general comments about the way in which this government has given every assistance to our emerging exporters. In conjunction with this year's budget, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) and the Minister for Trade (Senator Cook) provided a budget paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in our emerging exports</EMPHASIS>. The amendment which we have before us today is but one of the measures provided for in the course of that budget to ensure that our emerging exporters are given every assistance to be successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the export market development grants amendments, there is a package of measures worth over $94 million over three years, which is worth drawing the House's attention to. The first initiative states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expanding the National Industry Extension Service to enable it to tailor information and consultancy services more closely to the needs of small and medium-sized firms</PARA>
<PARA>The second initiative states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Building a network of First Stop Shops to give businesses fast and comprehensive access to specialised information and services on government assistance</PARA>
<PARA>Another initiative states:</PARA>

<PARA>A further initiative states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Initiating the Market Australia Campaign to project an image of Australia and key markets as a technologically advanced and sophisticated economy</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, yet another initiative:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasing funding for the Development Import Finance Facility to further assist Australian firms in gaining access to development projects in the Asian region</PARA>
<PARA>All these measures, in their ambition and their scope, help to ensure that we continue to grow as an exporting country and that small- and medium-sized companies are given every assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that budget paper, there are a couple of interesting export growth tables which are worthy of drawing to the House's attention. Many honourable members would be aware of the McKinsey report on emerging exporters. In the course of that study, the McKinsey report predicts that the small- and medium-sized companies' exporting growth potential is from just over $4 billion in 1986-87 to just under $16 billion by 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That export performance potential is, in no small measure, assisted by the measures I referred to. In addition to the growth in exports by the small- and medium-sized companies, there has been growth in the level of Australian manufactured exports. In 1982-83, according to Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade figures, our exports of simply transformed or elaborately transformed manufactures were in the order of $3.8 billion and, by 1991-92, were in the range of $13 billion and, as the McKinsey report makes clear, with every potential for increased growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that paper, budget related paper No. 6 refers to Australia's trade development program. There are a couple of passages in that budget related paper which summarise the government's policy objectives. Under the heading `Australia's future as a trading nation' this comment appears:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia must succeed in the international marketplace if it is to achieve the stronger economic growth that will underpin job creation. Improvement in our export performance is an important way to sustain higher growth in output and employment.</PARA>
<PARA>In that budget related paper, the Minister for Trade makes the point that the key policy objectives in trade are as follows: to accelerate the transition of Australia from an inward-looking to an internationally oriented economy; to encourage the emergence of fully open and fair markets globally and an inte</PARA>
<PARA>grated open market in the Asia-Pacific region; to strengthen Australia's position in existing markets; to deepen and broaden Australia's economic links with east Asian economies; to position Australia to realise emerging market opportunities; and to ensure international awareness of Australia as a technologically and managerially sophisticated economy, a culturally diverse and liberal society, and a producer of leading ideas and quality, high-value goods and services. In short, pursuing all these objectives will ensure that Australia can make its own way in the world as a modern trading and manufacturing country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that budget related paper, we have a summary of merchandise trade by broad category. To see and appreciate the growth in this area, I again refer to the area of elaborately transformed manufactures and simply transformed manufactures. In the calender year 1988 the figures record that the export of elaborately transformed manufactures stood at a value of just over $5.7 billion; in 1992 it was in the order of $10.9 billion. Over the corresponding period the export of simply transformed manufactures rose from $4.4 billion to $5.4 billion. That highlights the great advance in the export of our elaborately transformed manufactures&mdash;an increase from $5.7 billion in 1988 to $10.9 billion in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That increased performance and the potential for even further increase are greatly assisted by the measures in this bill. By assisting exporters to ensure a long-term, stable future we will secure jobs for Australia by increasing trade in our region and turning ourselves into a modern trading exporting country. However, these measures are much more assisted by the macro-economic policies the government has adopted since it came to office in 1983, opening Australia up as an internationally competitive country and ensuring that, through international competitiveness and assistance to exporters&mdash;particularly small- and medium-sized companies&mdash;this country becomes a strong, viable, modern, industrial trading and manufacturing country in this region.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than cover the same ground as the Leader of the National Party, who has already outlined in detail the few minor concerns the coalition has with these amendments, I would like to examine the export market development grants scheme in more general terms. </PARA>

It provides financial incentives in the form of taxable cash grants based on eligible expenditure on a range of overseas marketing activities promoting export sales. Export enhancement measures such as the EMDGS are provided by governments in recognition of the high risks and costs which firms would otherwise have to bear, particularly in the early stages of exporting.,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there has been some past criticism of the scheme, questioning the scheme's impact on export growth and its cost effectiveness, it can be said to have had a role in the context of the government's failure to deal with the structural inefficiencies which harm Australian exports. It is important, however, not to consider the scheme in isolation. It must be examined in the context of the government's overall effort to enhance Australia's export performance and the need to push ahead with micro-economic reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is, in part, a direct response to the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in our emerging exporters</EMPHASIS>, mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), produced recently by McKinsey and Co. for the Australian Manufacturing Council. A landmark report,<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Investing in our emerging exporters</EMPHASIS>, was based on a survey of 700 high value-added manufacturing firms and provided an analysis of the challenges and opportunities Australia and Australian manufacturers face in integrating into a global economy and building an effective export culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report identified a number of impediments to export activity including: the restricted availability of finance for small- to medium-sized enterprises; restricted access to key markets; a lack of management skills amongst those that run Australia's small- to medium-sized enterprises; problems of access to technology; and a lack of appropriate market information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to these impediments, the report made several major policy recommendations, including changes to the scheme, that are covered in this bill. It seems, however, that the government has been slow to act on many of the report's recommendations. For example, it has ignored the report's call for a strategic vision of Australia's economic future, a vision that recognises the importance of exports&mdash;particularly exports based on innovation. And it has been less than comprehensive in addressing the need to streamline the delivery of the numerous government programs available to small- and medium-sized enterprises, access to which was described in the report as `complex and ad hoc'; the need for improved access to finance; and/or the need for comparisons between Australia and our east Asian trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most salient points made in the report is that up to 90 per cent of Australian manufacturers do not export at all. One could have been excused for not realising this sobering fact after attending, as I did, the national export awards held here at Parliament House only recently. Organised each year by Austrade and the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the awards are an occasion for justifiable satisfaction and recognition of the success of Australian companies in the international marketplace. They should, however, be a bipartisan affair, and they should not be highjacked by a government determined to present a biased and misleading view of the nation's export performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `politically correct' version of Australia's export performance&mdash;a version which differs dramatically from the reality&mdash;was pushed relentlessly throughout the awards ceremony, particularly by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Trade (Senator Cook).

That theme was established right at the start of the evening with the singing of the national anthem during which the speaker's face on the video monitors obscured the Union Jack in the Australian flag. We knew where we were heading from that moment&mdash;it was clear that the evening was under tight political direction, and everything that followed simply confirmed that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The official, politically correct version of Australia's export performance is that, as a result of the government's `reforms', Australia's companies are dramatically lifting their export performance&mdash;illustrated by the performance of the magnificent 700, identified by the McKinsey report. In the official version, Australian technology based manufacturing is now off and running and it is only a matter of time before the gap between exports and imports is closed. Government policies, according to this line, have succeeded. No-one would have left the award ceremony with the impression that the government believed that Australia had any significant policy challenges ahead or that a substantial reform agenda still remained to be completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth, however, is very different. Australia's export performance remains far below that which is necessary to correct our mounting foreign debt. As a nation, we are still living beyond our means on a grand scale. The current account deficit of $1.2 billion for October shows that Australia is plunging further into debt and underlines the fact that we are a long way short of exporting enough to pay for imports and to service our foreign debt. It is a sad fact that Australia's ranking amongst world exporters fell from 11th in 1956 to 22nd in 1990. Our relative decline as a world trading nation highlights the fact that under this government we remain uncompetitive in the global marketplace in too many areas. As Warren Haynes of ICI Australia pointed out to the recent Business Council of Australia conference on micro-economic reform, we are actually facing a widening gap on the merchandise balance of trade with imports of manufactured goods increasingly outstripping manufactured exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's manufacturing effort remains one of the poorest in the OECD. The recession has seen manufacturing slump lower in 1991-92 than in 1982-83 or even 1974-75. Between 1985 and 1991, manufacturing output per head increased by an average of 10 per cent across the OECD countries while in Australia it rose by only one per cent&mdash;one of the weakest performances in the industrialised world. Despite all the talk about encouraging research and development and technology based exports, the fact is that Australia's relative ranking in business R&amp;D is 17th out of 24 OECD countries and has not improved in the last decade. The impact of the 150 per cent tax concession in encouraging R&amp;D pales into insignificance, to use the recent words of the Bureau of Industry Economics, when measured against the vast number of Australian enterprises which do not perform research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World class education and training, which must be in the years ahead the foundation of Australia's international comparative advantage, have been driven by confused and inconsistent political agendas at great cost to scientific research and the ability to maintain international quality standards. The latest opinion of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) that Australia has too many universities and too few institutions focused on vocational education and training demonstrates the lack of a coherent strategy behind the upheaval of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) of recent years. To raise these issues in the context of this debate is not to poor mouth Australia, as the government bleats every time uncomfortable facts come to life. Rather, it is to be honest about the dimension of the task that this country faces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, a whopping 90 per cent of Australian manufacturing businesses do not export, and the present policy mix is not encouraging them to do so. Australian enterprise is handicapped by major impediments to innovation which the government refuses to acknowledge. These impediments were well identified at the Business Council of Australia conference that I referred to earlier and in the report released this month <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managing the innovative enterprise</EMPHASIS>, as the outcome of a study commission chaired by Sir Roderick Carnegie. We hear a lot about the McKinsey report, but we have heard precious little so far&mdash;in fact, I wonder whether we have heard anything&mdash;from this government about this very important report of the Business Council of Australia on innovation. The reason we have heard so little about this report from the government can be readily seen when we look at the main recommendations of this report. This report called upon the government to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . hasten the removal of the key regulatory impediments to improved enterprise performance by accelerating changes in the labour market that make it easier to achieve the positive employee relations that underpin the success of leading innovative businesses.</PARA>
<PARA>There was no mention of such a challenge at the export awards. The government's failure in this area strikes at the heart of the capacity of Australian business to undertake the kind of innovation, including innovation in technology, which is absolutely essential to build up our international competitiveness. The derailing of the process of industrial relations reform by the Brereton legislation is a body blow to hopes for an improved environment for business innovation and, therefore, improved exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this morning's press, Mr Ian Salmon, chairman of the economic and finance panel of the Business Council of Australia, in criticising the government's industrial relations reform package, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a tragedy that the Industrial Relations Reform Bill has missed the opportunity to add to private sector recovery. To the contrary, we fear that it will entrench a resistance to changing inefficient and unproductive work organisation and will, consequently, retard investment and international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>The reform which the government and the Prime Minister and his mate promote is seen by the major business enterprises of this country as positively retarding the movement of this country to international competitiveness. What a damning indictment of the government's proposed reforms in this vital area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chairman of the Industry Commission, Mr Bill Scales, has also pointed out in recent weeks that, in addition to genuine progress towards enterprise bargaining, there must be a major effort made to reduce the costs to business from regulatory arrangements at different levels of government and to remove the impediments to the states undertaking reform of their government business enterprises, especially those providing energy and transport. It is not enough to compare the present performance of our electricity, rail, port or telecommunications utilities with their performance in the past. It is the international comparison which counts and, despite improvements, the comparative costs for loading times at Australian ports, for example, are still three times the cost in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent tax increases such as the fuel tax have undermined any benefits flowing from past changes and impact heavily on the mining industry and coastal shipping. The complete absence of any coherent strategy from the government on business taxation further undermines efforts to build up value added enterprise in Australia. At present the evidence is that the overhead costs of government business enterprises not exposed to competition are far too high and that by international benchmarks Australian infrastructure is a significant handicap to enterprise. Government business enterprises contribute some 10 per cent to GDP and their services comprise between 10 and 16 per cent of business costs. Much of the crucial reform in this area must be made by the states, and enhancing international competitiveness requires a major effort of federal-state cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the culture of the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party has ill-equipped it for an effective effort at cooperative federalism. The Prime Minister clearly has no concept of this, as demonstrated by his successful assault on the previous Prime Minister's agenda in this area, because the Prime Minister, as we know, is a centralist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's strategy, exemplified by the way the whole Mabo policy development was handled, is to divide and conquer, not to develop a national strategy and cooperate with the states. If the Hilmer report is to be implemented successfully, cooperation between the Commonwealth and states will be essential. A proper sense of nationhood must be built on such cooperation, not on attempts to increasingly dictate from Canberra what happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In today's global economy, investment capital is highly mobile. We have to recognise that Australia is only one option and that unless the productivity of capital in Australia can be improved significantly by reforms in the key areas to which I have referred, investment will go elsewhere. With it will go the jobs and the hopes of literally millions of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy of the present situation is that Australia is experiencing a massive failure of national leadership. Instead of having a government prepared to tell people the truth about our nation's predicament and rally people to support the necessary change, we have one which is going out of its way to conceal the reality and convince people that all is well. In the end, political correctness will not conceal fundamental policy failure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Export Market Development Grants Legislation Amendment Bill which seeks to amend the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974. The amendments being proposed strike a fairly healthy balance between preserving the integrity of the export market development grants scheme and preserving the flexibility of the scheme. As mentioned by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), the thrust of the amendments is three-fold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it excludes from eligibility persons with criminal convictions under the Corporations Law or in respect of serious fraud, and certain claimants under schemes of arrangement. Secondly, it seeks to assist the cash flow of emerging exporters by providing them with the facility to lodge grants and claims on a half-yearly basis. Thirdly, it will effect a number of technical amendments of an administrative nature, consistent with the tightening of ongoing risk management procedures which clarify the established intention of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of these measures is projected to be about $1 million for administration, there being no expected additional cost for grant payments. The overriding purpose of these amendments is to maintain the integrity of the EMDG scheme. Referring to the exclusion of persons with criminal convictions, the amendment relates to those serious criminal offences under Corporations Law. It does not apply to the more minor offences, but to convicted persons with a penalty of two years imprisonment or greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be some opposition to this provision on the basis that it acts retrospectively in a sense. But we have to accept the basic proposition in this case that non-payment in these circumstances is quite acceptable. If we do not do that, we will not preserve the integrity of the scheme. Once we accept that basic proposition, the action being proposed in this amendment can be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That provision of the act also provides an executive or a partner who is convicted of a serious offence&mdash;in that case the company or partnership claimants&mdash;to be ineligible to lodge a claim for a grant. The logic is that the whole provision is unworkable unless that situation exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as insolvency and schemes of arrangement are concerned, if a claimant is insolvent a grant will not be payable. If a partner becomes insolvent, the partnership is ineligible for grant assistance under this scheme. Once again, given the provisions as they exist in this amendment, it is the only way that we can preserve the integrity of this rather worthwhile scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criticism of the half-yearly claims lodgement procedures has been levelled in the past. There is a delay between firms incurring the expenditure from the exporter and the time they receive grant assistance from the scheme. I suppose this can be understood, given the degree of flexibility of the EMDG scheme and the need to contain the costs of the scheme. That cash flow problem has always been there for emerging exporters. The government has homed in on those exporters and has been quite reasonable in this provision by limiting it to exporters for the first three years, simply because the cash flow is more important to emerging exporters than to experienced exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export market development grants scheme has played a part in the ongoing development of Australia's export performance, not only over the last decade, but certainly in the years since its inception in 1974. It is but one of the components of the activities of Austrade. I will speak very briefly tonight on the performance of that organisation. In industry, some people have sought to avail themselves at times of the benefits of Austrade&mdash;and have not been too pleased with the support they have received. But it is fair to say that evidence suggests overwhelmingly that Austrade has lifted its game substantially and now is a very important support mechanism for Australia achieving in its export performance, as mentioned earlier by the honourable gentlemen opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992-93 annual report of Austrade is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Really making a difference. . . </EMPHASIS>I suggest that all members of this House read the document. It suggests that Austrade has assisted exporters in achieving export sales of over $4 billion. Some people might question that figure but Austrade has conducted surveys that have been verified by private organisations. They seem to indicate that it has been invaluable for exports worth $300 million and deemed to be significant for exports worth $2.54 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can take heart from the fact that many people in the export ring are availing themselves of the services of this organisation and think fairly highly of its performance. Overlapping those statistics, but not included in them, are the 2,473 claimants in 1992-93 under the export market development grants scheme, with exports worth $3.59 billion&mdash;a claim value under the scheme of $181 million. In 1991-92 there were 2,000 claimants with a claim value of $143 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics I have just given the House indicate the sort of growth that has occurred as more exporters have become aware of this scheme and have availed themselves of its provisions. The government has amended the scheme and extended it to make it more effective and efficient in delivering that export assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EMDG scheme was established in 1974 and has undergone significant modification since its inception. It is fair to say that the scheme has attracted a fair degree of criticism through the years, centred around the increasing cost of the scheme to the government and the administrative looseness in the past, which has caused a degree of rorting by unscrupulous firms in the export area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has succeeded over the last decade in targeting assistance under this scheme more effectively and has managed to contain the cost of the scheme within reasonable budgetary limits to get a reasonable outcome. We now have a scheme that achieves its objectives. It has integrity, relevance and good performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who made some fairly strong comments about Australia's export performance. I suppose we can tote out any sorts of figures that we like about Australia's performance in this area and be very critical of it. Where we are today is not where we were yesterday or a decade ago. The honourable member for Goldstein was in the House before I was. I throw this question out to him: to what extent did previous coalition governments address the fundamental issues that he enunciated to the House tonight? I suspect that, if he were honest in that appraisal and that evaluation, he would say that they did not do it very well at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In coming to government in 1983 we faced a very daunting task, a very urgent national task to literally transform the Australian economy from an inward-looking economy to an internationally oriented one. That involved a massive change to the business culture in Australia. Nobody ought to underestimate the dimensions of that particular task. To achieve a cultural change in any environment is a most time consuming, resource consuming and difficult undertaking. In this country we have engineered an enormous structural adjustment and, as far as its manufacturing capability is concerned, we have positioned Australia to take advantage not only of the new emerging opportunities in our region but those that will come with a more buoyant American economy and a more buoyant world economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that national task we have sought to open up the international global markets. I commend the former ministers for trade and the present Minister for Trade (Senator Cook) for their persistence and their unswerving dedication to achieving a favourable GATT outcome for this country. We are on the verge of one of the most significant boosts over time to the Australian economy if this GATT round can be put to bed. We have also had developments such as APEC in our region, which simply mean a greater integration of the Australian economy with those of our near north. In the end, that translates into increased economic activity in Australia and more jobs for Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results of those activities over a decade have been quite staggering, despite what the honourable member for Goldstein might like to put to us here tonight. Over that period we have seen a virtual revolution in Australian export performance. We have refocused our exporting effort from simply focusing on the export of commodities to focus on the rich, value adding elaborately transformed manufactures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has this taken place? It has not just taken place for nothing. There are reasons, and the reasons are these: the government has engineered a massive refocus on our Asian region. For too long we saw ourselves tied&mdash;</PARA>

I see nothing but constructiveness coming from this temporary hiccup in our relationship. We have succeeded in refocusing on our near north and our export performance proves that. In addition to that, in our business enterprises we have succeeded in changing the attitude of the managers of these enterprises and have encouraged them to look outward into the region to sell their goods and services. Within their firms we have encouraged a greater emphasis on research and development expenditure and an emphasis on total quality management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the macro settings right at the moment. Interest rates are the lowest that they have been for some 20 years, the inflation rate is the lowest that it has been for 20 years and the exchange rate settings are fairly favourable to Australian exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) smiles, as he often does, when these sorts of positions are put to members of the opposition, but they are undeniable facts. The undeniable facts are that the macro settings are right for Australia to take advantage of the emerging world recovery. In micro settings within firms we have seen dramatic improvements in the culture and performance of firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics are quite outstanding. Of the 700 smaller manufacturers that now have exports totalling $8.3 billion, those exports are growing at a rate of 13 per cent per annum and will rise to $16 billion by the year 1997. In 1991-92 total merchandising exports grew and in 1992-93 were up by 10.3 per cent. Manufactured exports grew in the same period by some 16 per cent and elaborately transformed exports grew by some 23 per cent to $12 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the opposition member who preceded me, the honourable member for Goldstein, when he said that there is much left to be done. But I think he ought to realise that the government is not the exporter of goods and services; the government can only assist the process. We have in place a range of measures, including the export market development grants scheme, which really does encourage that process to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my concluding remarks, I would like to refer to the task that we face in regional areas such as mine in refocussing the business sector on the export area to achieve greater export performance in the region. I think it is fair to say that in the less cosmopolitan regions of the nation the cultural impediments to the sort of export performance that we would want are more pronounced than they perhaps are in city areas. The networks that the smaller and medium firms require to achieve the critical mass and the support are just not there in rural and regional areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to do several things. We have to place a greater emphasis on changing the culture of business in regional and country areas. I am pleased to say that that process is under way and will gather steam as we head towards the year 2000. We must ensure that small and medium exporters have access to the sort of finance that will enable them to mount an export effort. It is not easy for a small firm that has a commercialised product that can be exported to divert the resources from its cash flow to mount that export effort. It needs the support of government. We have in place a range of measures to assist those firms. The critical element in that equation is their access to finance to build their enterprise to achieve that critical mass and to get into the export ring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At regional levels&mdash;I guess this applies throughout the nation&mdash;we must focus again on our educational institutions as vehicles for changing the culture or for encouraging the export culture. We must make our schools vehicles to press the total quality management agenda. We must press our schools to make sure that their courses reflect Australia's position in the region, we must ensure that those courses seek to imbue in our children an understanding of the cultures and we must encourage the use of the languages of those countries to our near north. We must ensure that the small and medium firms have access to appropriate networks and the support services, such as the export market development grants scheme, that will assist them to get into the export ring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition speaker who preceded me made several points which I want to take up in the time that is left to me. The honourable member for Goldstein said that the government lacks strategic vision. The evidence just does not support that statement. The macro settings are right. We have seen a significant improvement in Australia's manufactured export performance and, indeed, we are well on the way to establishing the sort of growth in exports that will meet the needs on the external account. He made the point that 90 per cent of manufacturers do not export. The simple reason that some of them do not export is that they do not have a product to export and they do not have particular competitive advantages in the production of those commodities to put them on the export markets. It is a nonsense proposition to drag out a 90 per cent statistic and then suggest that the government has failed in its policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Goldstein made the point&mdash;and I think this came from a report that he quoted&mdash;that we remain uncompetitive in international markets. If that is the case, then why do we have the growth in exports that we have at this particular time? Why do we have this massive growth in exports? The simple reason is that the micro-economic settings and the macro settings are correct. There is not a coalition speaker who gets on his or her feet in this House without mentioning labour market deregulation. The simple fact of the matter is that the coalition would like to see as its recipe for curing Australia's ills the total deregulation of Australia's labour market.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to rise tonight to add a few remarks in this debate on the Export Market Development Grants Legislation Amendment Bill. The honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) had a number of courageous things to say when he talked about what a wonderful job this government was doing in terms of industry policy, how coordinated it was and how wrong the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) was. The honourable member for Goldstein said that this government lacked strategic direction. I have to say that that is correct. This government does lack strategic direction. It has a whole range of individual, discrete programs that delve into areas of industry policy, but without any concept of what it is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why I think that is true is that there are so few honourable members on the government side of the House, on the treasury bench in this House, who actually understand what industry is all about; who understand what it is to employ people; who understand what it is to develop products for the commercial market; and who understand what consumers want and what business needs in order to survive, to develop, to grow and to foster employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Corio also talked courageously about how oppositions in the past couple of decades have not really contributed much to Australia's performance. I remind the honourable member for Corio that at the beginning of the 1970s, as I recall, when Gough Whitlam and his merry men inherited the treasury bench, they took over at a time when the country virtually had no unemployment, where we had almost no national debt, where just about everyone had a family home, where families were the centre of our society, and where morals and community caring were important national attributes. One of the first things that good old Gough and his merry men did was to frighten the living life out of the manufacturing industry. If the manufacturing industry is now starting to recover, it is 25 years down the track from when Gough literally destroyed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export market development grants scheme is an important part of whatever this government's industry policy is. But that policy is literally a hotchpotch of discrete bits and pieces without any cohesion and lacking, as I have said before, any strategic direction. We have a need to bring together the various elements of government policy, including taxation, industrial relations, industry policy, science and technology, and education as a cohesive haul to try to set the direction in which we want the nation to head. But that is not what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It just so happens that this grants scheme is one of the most important planks of the government's industry policy. That is sad, is it not? It says that we have to go out and offer firms money in order to encourage them to become exporters and to do marketing. I must say that one of the things I have always found to regret is that we, as a nation, have not addressed the issue of marketing in any strong sense. In recent days we have started to come to grips with the fact that we live in the Asian region&mdash;that we are not an island in the Northern Hemisphere; we are in the Southern Hemisphere. We have to learn to market our products and services, which are excellent products and very innovative services, to convince people around the world that what we have to offer, gives them an advantage&mdash;in terms of cost, quality and innovation. It is this issue of marketing that we address when we look to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of our problems is the fact that small- and medium-sized companies have been encouraged by this government for some time now to export, export, export&mdash;and with good reason. If we look at our balance of payments problem, we will see that our net foreign debt is now up to $178 billion, as I recall. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when I travel throughout my electorate and, indeed, throughout Australia and talk to owners and managers of small firms and medium-sized businesses that could fill niche markets and could drive to export, they say, `The government says export, export, export, but the government does nothing to help us; the government does not provide any major assistance that we can come to grips with'. I say to them, `But how about this program, that program and another program?'. They say, `What are those?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that one of the problems we have is the fact that the government does not actually market the programs that it has. Do honourable members know that there are approximately 160 discrete programs that deal with assistance to industry in one form or another? We can buy a book for something like $155 that will tell us what each of these schemes is. The book is updated yearly to try to keep track of it all. In my office recently we tried to put together for our businesses a list of those more active programs that the government has at the moment. As we found, these programs included: the EMDG; the international trade enhancement scheme; the development import finance facility; the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation; the National Export Education Centre&mdash;did honourable members know about that one; that was a new one&mdash;enterprise development through the national industry extensions services; the small- and medium-enterprise development program; export access through DITARD, Austrade and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an Asia-Pacific fellowship program and the Australian international management exchange program. The MTIA provides some valuable assistance for its members and others in the metals industry. There is a small business network, a project marketing loans facility, a national teaching company scheme&mdash;that is a new one that I did not know about&mdash;and tax incentives for research and development. That is an important initiative. There is the national procurement development program, a discretionary grants scheme, the advanced manufacturing technology development program, the generic technology grants scheme, the rural industries business extension service, business advisers for rural areas program, the innovative agricultural marketing program, the Australian Industry Development Corporation, and the Commonwealth Development Bank. Then there are a few specific programs which deal with the textile, clothing and footwear industry, shipbuilding and printing in terms of bounty assistance for those firms which have been particularly hurt by rapid falls in tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that if we, as members of this place, want to tell the small businesses in our electorates what these programs are there is no single place where we can go to find a listing of them. The Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development cannot even tell us the range of major programs that are available to assist industry in a development sense. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OT4">Mr CHARLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not wrong because I have tried to find out. I suggest to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney)&mdash;perhaps one of his advisers will read this speech&mdash;that such a listing ought to be a priority. We produced a listing, but that is not our job. We are in opposition; we are not in government. One would have thought that surely the bureaucracy could come together to produce a list and advertise the assistance that is available to companies which would like to export.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill addresses three significant issues, none of which the opposition has any particular problem with. The first says, essentially, that firms which are insolvent shall not participate in the scheme. That is fair enough&mdash;they should not. The second says that firm owners or principals of firms which have been convicted of a felony which is associated&mdash;particularly in a business sense&mdash;with business ventures are not the proper people to attract this grant. That is fair enough. The third issue brings forward payments for the scheme to a half yearly rather than a full yearly basis which does provide some assistance in the start-up years, particularly for small- and medium-sized firms. Those are the three things that this bill sets out to achieve. I actually applaud the minister for this further modification of the export market development grants scheme to include these proper initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what does this bill fail to address? In my view, it fails to address two significant areas which it should take a look at. First, it is my understanding that approximately 25 per cent&mdash;perhaps higher&mdash;of participants in the scheme drop out after the second year and before the third year, which is the first year that the participants' actual export performance is tested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There could be a number of reasons for that. It could be that many firms invest their money in marketing programs without any real idea of whether it will benefit them or not. They think, `Oh, well, if I get the grant, then I spent some money but I got the grant to help offset the costs. So what?'. I think that is a pretty short-sighted view. I think probably very few firms would set out to do that. In the first place, one needs to invest $30,000 before one can apply for a grant. That is not an inconsiderable sum when it is a cost for a firm to consider in making that effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to be more likely that the firms drop out because they are unable, even through the extra marketing effort, to generate the extra income needed to meet the test. If that is the case, then the scheme&mdash;at least in the sense that in the third year it is attempting to find out the level of increased exports&mdash;is operating properly. But I think the department needs to have a good close look at what happens between year 2 and year 3. I would be pleased to hear from the minister, if he has received advice already, as to the reason for the high drop-out rate at that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program is clearly designed to encourage people who have not exported in the past to export now. That is what we want to encourage. There will be a failure rate, as there is some rate of failure in all business from all entrepreneurial activity. That is a good reason for government to stay out of it, too, because it has always been the case that those who wish to try new ventures do so at a risk. The risk is either of gain or failure. Governments need not be about failure; they need to be about encouragement and direction and setting the parameters which will allow the private sector to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second item that this bill fails to address concerns a report which was brought down by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology earlier this year. That report was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Undersold overseas?</EMPHASIS>. The members of that committee worked very hard at the beginning of this 37th Australian parliament to try to bring down this report&mdash;which deals with the export market development grants scheme with respect to the tourism industry&mdash;ahead of the budget so that the minister had the opportunity to consider our findings and bring in a bill at budget time to incorporate our recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the tourism industry was eligible for grants under this scheme from 1978 to 1985, and then from 1985 to 1987 through a scheme parallel to the EMDGS. It was re-admitted to this EMDG scheme in a limited way in 1990. I say a limited way because those firms in the tourism industry that wished to participate in this scheme are restricted in the following manner. Tourism operators must supply at least three of the following amenities: transport of passengers by land, transport of passengers by water, transport of passengers by air, accommodation, tour escort, or admission to a tourist attraction. Because they have to supply at least three of those items it effectively restricts businesses applying for the scheme to only one sector&mdash;that is, those who offer package tours and in fact inbound tourist operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our report found that, by restricting tourism operators to those sectors only, the scheme was inequitable in that respect. No other industry sector&mdash;not manufacturing, agriculture, defence or any other industry&mdash;had such restrictions applied to it. The tourism industry had demonstrated exceedingly well its ability to attract new tourists to Australia. It found that marketing programs, at least in a generic sense, had been very successful. We all recall the Paul Hogan `shrimp on the barby' ads that were shown in the United States and boosted our tourist income from that country quite markedly. So, in a generic sense, we know that marketing works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scheme is designed to allow individual people&mdash;whether they be hotel operators, small tourism operators, owners of an attraction park or theme park, people who have motels at places such as Kakadu or whatever&mdash;to produce brochures and offer particular attractions overseas to encourage more people to come to Australia for a specific purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, we made four recommendations. The first was that the scheme be extended to include all of the tourism industry. The second recommendation was that that part of the act that described joint ventures and consortia be amended to include tourism services so that several small operators in an area could act together. For instance, in the Dandenong Ranges in my electorate of La Trobe, several small tourism operators could get together in a consortium and apply for an export market development grant and attract more tourists to our local area. The third recommendation was that the extension of the scheme to the whole tourism industry should take place by 1 July 1993. That time has passed. The last recommendation was that there should be no decrease in funds for some other part of the tourism industry in order to accomplish this. I am disappointed, as was the committee, that the minister failed to take up our recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last item I wish to address in the few seconds remaining to me is the fact that government purchasing policy as it operates at the moment actually operates in the opposite direction to that of the export market development grant. Government purchasing policy encourages overseas purchases, not Australian. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to honour a commitment to a small businessman in my electorate. I also take the opportunity, having listened to the speech by the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), to respond to a couple of comments he made. I thought he was very patronising in regard to rural and regional exporters when he talked about their lack of an export culture. As I understand it, 80 per cent of our exports come out of regional and rural Australia. One thing our opponents would not like to acknowledge is that Australia was founded on the great export industries of regional Australia. I found the comments of the honourable member for Corio particularly demeaning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member mentioned the matter of access to finance. I note that the Minister for Science and Small Business, Senator Schacht, has made great play of the fact that banks must lend to small business. It is a great irony that this finance system, which the government says is a wonderful system, somehow is still unable to lend enough to small business. The honourable member went on to mention education, schools and some other matters. He then commented that the government does have a strategic vision about growth in exports, but he then said&mdash;and I acknowledge the comments made by my colleague the shadow minister in this regard&mdash;that 95 per cent of Australian companies do not export. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) quite rightly referred to our balance of payments and our debt crisis. Perhaps the word `crisis' is overused, but I do not think anyone would underestimate the need to manage the net debt of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remarks made by the honourable member for Corio give me an excellent opportunity to make a few comments in trying to defend my constituents. After all, my electorate produces 50 per cent of South Australia's exports. If I could be slightly partisan, under the new Brown government we should see the situation improve considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it has been readily acknowledged in the debate that nobody is disputing the three main points of this legislation&mdash;the matter of illegal activities, et cetera. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I wish to honour a commitment I made to a small businessman in my electorate about the fact that it is quite restrictive on the smaller exporter&mdash;50 per cent of eligible expenditure for at least $30,000 after the first $15,000. It may be that advisers have found all sorts of good reasons why the government cannot encourage these smaller businesses, but I am not convinced at this stage. I ask the minister to consider whether it is possible to encourage these smaller entrepreneurs. After all, they can only become large entrepreneurs if they get sufficient incentive originally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a passing observation about the EMDG grants: I hope that many of us in this country do not get into the habit of camouflaging the reality of government policy. I cannot emphasise strongly enough the fact mentioned by the honourable member for Corio&mdash;the $4 billion in export earnings generated. That should be set alongside the $50 billion or so in export earnings per annum that is generated in this country without support. Of course, I support the EMDG grants; I think they have been in operation for 19 years. Nevertheless, they must be put in context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my belief and the belief of those on this side of the House that enterprise is the ultimate generator of employment. It is the only thing that can destroy unemployment. Trade, as we in this place would all agree, is essential to our survival. Yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that growth was the only real way to reduce unemployment. Let us not be tricked into thinking that a few million dollars in grant money is going to overcome our overwhelming problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To sum up, it is important that we look at the smallest exporters and that we try to find ways of encouraging those people. It is important to remember that 95 per cent of Australia's companies do not export. I believe employment can only come from increased growth. Much of that growth can only come from exports. Mention was made of the 700 smaller manufacturers whose combined export income is expected to increase from $8 billion to $16 billion by 1997. I wonder whether those figures were done before the August budget. The great irony of the August budget was its effect on exporters. It would be very interesting to do some kind of analysis of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I was disappointed to hear the honourable member for Corio talk about this less cosmopolitan, regional group of people. I know that they produce a very significant part of Australia's exports; I believe the figure to be 80 per cent. Much of the urban wealth of this country was built on the exports of regional Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all honourable members who have participated in the debate. A couple of matters were raised during the debate which require a response. During the contribution by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) he asked what mechanisms will be in place to prevent a person convicted of an offence overseas from receiving an export market development grant. I have been informed that in all cases claimants for grants are required to certify, on the official export market development grant claim form lodged with Austrade, that they have or have not been convicted of an offence as set down in the proposed amendments. Austrade is in the process of instituting a procedure to provide for random sampling of these statements. Selected claims will be referred to the Australian Federal Police for verification against records held by them and other agencies in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AFP will, in a number of randomly selected cases, be further requested to make inquiries overseas through relevant agencies with which they have working relationships. It is not possible to list in this proposed legislation all of the equivalent convictions in all of the countries of the globe. The AFP will be asked to base its inquiries on its knowledge of what would be appropriate to the particular country of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade currently receives in excess of 3,000 claims per annum under the scheme. As the vast majority of claimants can be assumed to respond to this question in the negative&mdash;that is, not convicted of an offence&mdash;the task of verifying each and every claim is obviously beyond the resources of Austrade and out of touch with current risk management practice, which accepts random sampling as valid in these circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill amends a number of bounty acts. The coalition will not oppose the bill. Given this, and because of the substantial legislative program before the House, I do not propose to spend a great deal of time debating this piece of legislation. However, I would like to make some general comments on the nature of the key measures being proposed and outline the coalition's thoughts on each.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the Bounty (Books) Act 1986 and the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984. These amendments arise out of government policy decisions. Amendments to the Bounty and Capitalisation Grants (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 and the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985 are minor and of a technical nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a signatory to the Florence agreement, Australia cannot impose tariffs on imported books which are of a scientific, educational or cultural nature. Accordingly, a bounty of 13.5 per cent is currently payable on the domestic production of such books. Tariffs are imposed on most other categories of imported books. Current bounty arrangements are due to expire on 31 December 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In anticipation of this, the government directed the Industry Commission to inquire into the operation of the bounty and report on future provision of measures to support the industry. Apart from its key recommendations, the Industry Commission, in its report of 15 October 1992, made a number of very interesting observations. It suggests, for example, that Australia does not have a particular cost advantage in any of the principal inputs to book production, namely labour, capital and materials. The Industry Commission also found that most books marketed in Australia are typically part of a large production run undertaken overseas. Indeed, about half of the work commissioned by the Australian publishers is printed overseas  principally in Hong Kong, Singapore and other parts of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Industry Commission's research, higher labour costs and paper costs are largely responsible for eroding our competitiveness on the international book market. While labour costs in Hong Kong and Singapore have been rising, the commission suggests that many book producers are overcoming this by transferring their operations to other parts of Asia, such as China and Malaysia, to maintain their competitiveness. The Industry Commission found that Australian producers' prospects were further limited because of their tendency to supply specialised niche markets. This means that they cannot get the length in production runs to produce cheaply and competitively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its final report, the Industry Commission recommended that tariff rates on imported books remain within the phased reduction program to five per cent in 1996; the book bounty be extended but progressively reduced to 4.5 per cent from 1 January 1997; the present minimum $500 claim per title be replaced with a requirement of a minimum production run of $3,700, with effect from 1 January 1994; and the present arrangements under which a publisher or printer may claim bounty remain unchanged. In making these recommendations, the Industry Commission pointed out that continued reductions in bounty will lower the burden on taxpayers and increase pressure on the industry to maintain productivity, technology and other efficiency gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has accepted the Industry Commission's recommendations, and this bill puts them into effect. While supporting the recommendations, the coalition believes that neither the industry nor the government must rest on its laurels and that further reductions in tariffs and bounties must occur following completion of the current schedule. Of course, in doing this, the onus is on the government to accelerate the pace of micro-economic reform so that industry can achieve some cost benefits. It is only once the lower costs generated by micro-economic reform begin to flow through that industry will become more competitive on both the domestic and international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted with interest the recent comments by the Industry Commission on micro-economic reform. I am sure the House would be aware that in its latest annual report the Industry Commission advised that much more remains to be done in the area of reform. Indeed, the commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The task of substantially increasing Australia's productivity growth is too important to allow opportunities for significant gains to pass.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pace of reform in some key areas has been frustratingly slow.</PARA>
<PARA>The government must also reduce the tax burden. Even though the House has heard many times about the proliferation of government taxes and charges placed on business, their impact is so severe and action has been so negligible that the message is worth repeating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxes and charges, such as the superannuation levy, leave loading, the training levy, payroll tax and sales tax on business inputs, all impose a massive cost burden on our manufacturers. In fact, I would like to share with the House a comparison of the sorts of government charges which an Australian manufacturer faces in the area of the labour market alone. They show quite clearly just how these taxes undermine our competitiveness. In Australia, employees gain a total of 43 days leave per year, including public holidays and annual leave. In New Zealand, that figure is 35 days, while in the United States it is 25 days. Superannuation leave loading in Australia is five per cent; in New Zealand it is zero; and in the US it is three per cent. Workers compensation loadings here average eight per cent compared with 3.4 per cent in New Zealand and 1.5 per cent in the US. Payroll tax is between five and seven per cent in Australia, depending on the state and the size of one's work force. In New Zealand and the US it is zero. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To see the potential of Australian manufacturing, one needs only to recall figures prepared for the coalition which suggest that, if a range of taxes and charges were lifted from industry, an extra $50 billion of income per annum could be generated. My challenge to the government is, instead of taking the easy way out and extending the bounty, to lift the costs from business and free it from the onerous regulatory burden. The bottom line is that bounties and tariffs are necessary only  because of all of the burdens which government imposes on industry. The bill also proposes to extend bounty eligibility to directories, other than telephone directories and timetables, where they contain less than 30 per cent advertising. Company prospectuses are specifically excluded from bounty eligibility on the grounds that they are similar to annual reports and shareholders reports, which are already excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment of a substantive nature relates to the computer bounty. The computer bounty is currently payable on the development and production of most forms of computer equipment, including modems, printed circuit boards and microprocessors. The bounty is due to expire on 31 December 1995. This bill tightens the eligibility for bounty, and limits expenditure by clarifying the definition of `research and development'. New administrative procedures are also proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill introduces a new definition of `research and development' modelled on the definition used in the Income Tax Assessment Act. It requires research and development to be a systematic, investigative or experimental activity aimed at the production of bountiable equipment. As such, the new definition ensures that bounty is only payable on the research and development leading to the production of new computer hardware and it specifically excludes the development of computer software. A second amendment ensures that the bounty is only payable on the production of computers which have application to more than one customer, thus excluding the manufacture of specialised computers for individual customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition welcomes these amendments. We have long been concerned about the inefficient handling by the government of grants programs and other forms of assistance. We only need to recall the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the disgraceful sports rorts she administered to get some idea of the potential for misuse. Any measure which tightens administration, makes recipients more accountable and directs funding only to those who fall within strictly defined criteria is deserving of coalition support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends bounty administration procedures, allowing interstate manufacturers to lodge consolidated claims across state and territory borders and providing for more efficient substantiation of eligible expenditure. This measure should reduce the administrative burden on manufacturers. Again, any measure which reduces paperwork and frees up industry to make life a little easier is certainly welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">IBM is one recipient of the computer bounty. I recently had the pleasure of visiting its Wangaratta assembly plant and I would like to offer my congratulations on its achievements. In this financial year, the Wangaratta plant will produce about 140,000 units, of which approximately 60 per cent will be exported. Its revenue this year will be in the order of $400 million, of which $300 million will come from export sales. The plant has a unique labour market arrangement and has negotiated competitive deals with domestic packaging and transport companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lesson of IBM is that Australian manufacturers can play a significant role in global manufacturing. Nevertheless, I ask honourable members to think about how much more of a force our manufacturers could become if all of the burdens imposed on them by this government were removed. I believe that the potential is unlimited. Unfortunately, in extending the bounty, the government has once again side-stepped the real issues and taken the easy way out. Although we are supportive of this bill, the coalition would be much happier if it were standing up here tonight supporting legislation which removes from industry these taxes, costs and other impediments. </PARA>

This bill passed the Senate on 26 October 1993 and was introduced in the House of Representatives on 27 October 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assistance by way of a bounty has been provided to both the book production and computer manufacturing industries for several years. In fact, bounty has been paid on certain Australian book productions since 1969, and it has been paid on the production of certain computer equipment since 1977. The aim of the bounty scheme in respect of books has been to assist the local book printing industry to compete with overseas printers. The aim of the bounty scheme in respect of computers has been to facilitate the development of an internationally competitive hardware manufacturing industry in Australia, and to improve the productivity and competitiveness of all industry sectors by encouraging the wider application of information technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its introduction in 1969, the book bounty has been applied to the major proportion of the Australian book production industry. The rates of bounty have been lowered gradually from 33 1/3 per cent in 1973 to the current rate of 13.5 per cent. The local printing industry has managed to maintain its share of the market through productivity improvements, which have more than offset the reductions in assistance. The Australian industry has kept pace with technological developments and is currently equipped to world standards. The continued adoption of new technology, including the use of desk top publishing software, provides scope for further productivity gains which will influence the nature and scope of book manufacture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government consulted extensively with industry following the release of the Industry Commission's final report on book production late last year. Comments made by industry were taken into consideration by the government when it considered extending the bounty arrangements. The computer bounty scheme has had a major positive impact on the level of research and development and manufacturing undertaken by manufacturers of bountiable equipment and has contributed to the diffusion of information technology among the wider industry, with Australia being generally recognised as one of the highest users of computer based technologies among industrialised nations. Indeed, the Bureau of Industry Economics, in its program evaluation report No. 8 of February 1990 on the computer bounty scheme, highlighted the high proportion of research and development undertaken by manufacturers of bountiable equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sector was identified as a strong performer with an average research and development intensity of nine per cent. That is to say the ratio of research and development expenditure to turnover amounted to nine per cent, far exceeding the manufacturing average of only one per cent at that time. Investment in both research and development manufacturing in this sector has continued to increase with total bounty payments rising from $13.2 million in 1985-86 and $31.1 million in 1988-89 to $74.9 million in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains amendments to provide for a definition of research and development. The new definition clarifies which factory costs are to be included under the phrase. In particular, it expressly requires that the object of any research and development must be the manufacture of bountiable equipment within the bounty period. At present, there is no equivalent requirement in that respect. It has been possible to claim research and development costs on activities which might result only in the manufacture of bountiable equipment well past the expiration of the scheme&mdash;that is, 31 December 1995. So only research and development activity which is for the unique needs of an individual customer is excluded from eligibility. Any research and development which results in products saleable to more than one customer is still eligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will be interested to learn that one of the main aims of the computer bounty has been to improve the productivity and the competitiveness of the wider Australian industry by encouraging the use of information technology. The absence of import duties on computer equipment has provided Australian industry with access to these technologies at close to world prices. At the same time, the computer bounty has ensured that Australian manufacturers of this equipment receive a similar level of assistance as that provided to general industry through tariff protection. In order to maintain this relative rate of assistance, the computer bounty is phasing down in line with reductions in general tariff assistance. These are important initiatives and will do a lot to assist both the computer manufacturing industry in this country and also the production of books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Forrest mentioned a number of matters. He urged the government to adopt more micro-economic reform, which is a commendable suggestion. The government is proceeding along that path with responsibility and at respectable speed. Indeed, the honourable member for Forrest suggests that the government should forgo a number of taxes&mdash;wholesale sales taxes, the training levy, the superannuation guarantee levy and so forth. I do not know what he suggests should be put in place of those various taxes. Is he suggesting that we should have a goods and services tax?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the honourable member for Forrest has been the shadow minister for manufacturing and service industries, across the field of havoc and politics he has performed in a reasonably responsible role. But many will understand my utter disappointment today when I read a media release allegedly issued by the honourable member for Forrest in relation to the announcement by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) of the decision by Data General to have its regional headquarters here in Australia. The honourable member for Forrest, in his media release, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would certainly be a lot more tangible than the rather warm and fuzzy idea of having 22 business people and unionists going around the world telling multinationals how beaut Australia is.</PARA>
<PARA>The 22 business people and unionists include Peter Bartels of Coles Myer, Tim Besley of the Commonwealth Bank, Philip Brass of Pacific Dunlop, John Foote of Du Pont Australia, Bob Joss of Westpac, Graeme McMahon of Ansett, Sir Arvi Parbo of Western Mining, John Prescott of BHP&mdash;and so the list goes on. These 22 business people and unionists have joined together to promote Australia as a regional headquarters location for overseas based corporations. The RHQ Leaders' Network, comprising these people, was launched today in Sydney. The network members will, according to their press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . harness their contacts and expertise to encourage US and European company decision makers to locate their RHQs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest to the honourable member for Forrest that that is the sort of thing that he, as the shadow minister for manufacturing and service industries, should be adopting and pursuing rather than issuing this rather snide, stupid statement which criticised these 22 business leaders of this country who recognise that the pursuit of regional headquarters in Australia means a lot to this country. The honourable member for Forrest would serve this country better and do a much greater service to the interests of the opposition by supporting the government in this particular area. I thought this comment was simply either a mistake by the honourable member's media officer or a misunderstanding by the honourable member himself. But then I read another media release dated 27 September 1993, in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After all, when a company chooses a location for its Asia-Pacific operations, it will be doing so with the bottom line firmly in mind. If it's not a viable economic proposition, it's not going to matter how good the Australian lifestyle is.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reducing burdens such as labour oncosts, the superannuation guarantee levy and the training levy, and addressing the often ridiculous complexity of our taxation system, would not only help attract multi-nationals to set up operations in Australia, it would also help our own companies become more competitive in world markets.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to the honourable member for Forrest that Data General does not agree with him. I am sure there must be hundreds of major corporations in the Asia-Pacific region simply bursting to locate here in Australia. As I did in my remarks earlier this evening, I ask the honourable member for Forrest: what taxes would he have this parliament revoke to meet the opposition requirements? Is it sales tax? Is it wholesale sales tax? Is it the training guarantee levy? Is it the superannuation levy? What taxes is the honourable member for Forrest seeking to wipe? Or is this just a subterfuge to try to get Fightback in and then say to us all after an election, `Now is the time to introduce a goods and services tax'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat&mdash;I have a lot of respect for the honourable member for Forrest and I still do&mdash;that this sort of stunt that he issued today in that release follows a consistent line of conduct from the media release he issued on 27 September.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 was agreed to by the Senate on 22 October. The coalition does not oppose this bill and hopes that it achieves its objective of encouraging more responsible behaviour with respect to prescription drugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would be aware that, as part of the 1993 budget, the federal government announced that it would be modifying the pharmaceutical benefits scheme arrangements for general patients. At present, there is a two-tier safety net limit which requires a general patient to pay $15.90 per PBS script up to a total of $309.90, referred to as the first threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thereafter, the patient pays $2.60 per PBS script until a second threshold of $361.50 is reached. Beyond this threshold, PBS drugs are provided free of charge. The scheme operates over a calendar year. As from New Year's Day each year, the patient reverts to paying $15.90 per PBS script until the first threshold is once again reached, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Passage of this bill will mean that from 1 January 1994 there will be a single threshold of $400 for general patients, that is, 25 PBS scripts at $16 each. The charge of $2.60 per PBS prescription will then apply for all further drugs, that is, free-of-charge prescriptions will no longer be available to general patients. The arrangements for pensioners and veterans and other recipients of drugs at a concessional rate are not affected. The increase in the threshold together with the removal of access to free prescription drugs are estimated to save $12.4 million in 1993-94, $32 million in 1994-95, $33.4 million in 1995-96 and $34.9 million in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the ageing of our population and new drugs being developed, the cost to the community of operating the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is growing at an alarming rate. In 1992-93, its cost increased by 25 per cent to $1.5 billion. It is obvious that a major reason for this is stockpiling or hoarding of medicines by patients. Somehow, we must strike a balance between the right of patients' access to the full range of beneficial drugs available on the one hand, and the need for responsible disbursement of taxpayers' money on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of drug stockpiling is obvious: in 1992 more than 70 per cent of the annual prescriptions for general patients were supplied in the last two months of the year. The argument for a continuing co-payment beyond the $400 threshold is that it will reduce the consumer's incentive to stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the coalition does not oppose this bill. However, another matter which has come to light recently and which will affect the cost of prescription drugs is this year's budget's introduction of a 20 per cent sales tax on bottles and labels for medicines which are dispensed at the pharmacy. According to recent press reports, the 20 per cent tax now applies to previously exempt containers and labels as a result of recent rewording of tax laws. Apparently, bottles filled at the wholesale stage are not subject to the tax. While the cost is only a matter of cents per item, in the case of non-PBS prescriptions, pharmacists now have to face a decision as to whether they pass this cost on to consumers or absorb the cost themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One really has to question whether the government knows what it is doing. Apparently it is possible that the amount collected will not actually cover the cost of administering the new tax. Consultants Ernst and Young have told the Pharmacy Guild that the increase in sales tax could lead to the government paying more in subsidies and administration than the $1.3 million it expects to collect in tax revenue. Further, the tens of millions of non-PBS prescriptions filled each year may increase in price, including popular cough mixtures, antihistamines and analgesics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter which I wish to raise is the problem that some elderly people face when handling their medical prescriptions. For example, I was recently contacted by a 70-year-old constituent who expressed his concern at the problems that elderly patients face when they are prescribed several medications or have their medication changed. He stated that he found the details were often very confusing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not apply only to elderly people&mdash;although they are certainly the most affected. There was a tragic example recently in Queensland of a young, healthy woman who misunderstood ambiguous instructions for taking malaria prevention tablets. Taking them with the frequency she believed was in accordance with her doctor's instructions killed her. This is a prime example of the need for an objective examination of how prescription information is conveyed to patients, and of how the text on medicine bottles or packaging can read to the non-expert consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I read of this in the newspaper less than a fortnight ago, I actually had in my possession a bottle of the same tablets&mdash;tablets that had been prescribed for me when I was visiting a country where malaria was rife. I looked at the directions on the label that I had been provided with and, so far as I could make out, they were identical to the directions which were apparently prescribed to this other young woman. In other words, it is a standard description of how to take these particular tablets when they are prescribed. Whilst I had never taken them incorrectly, when I re-read that label I did understand how someone could make the mistake of taking daily the number of tablets that are meant to be taken weekly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people are ill, the risk increases. Perhaps the government, together with medical bodies, should seriously consider a campaign of education within its own ranks to avoid ambiguity at all costs so as to ensure that such tragic deaths do not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate on this bill in the Senate, Senator Newman, the Shadow Minister for the Family and Health, raised the important issue of the role of pharmacists in the prescription and supply of drugs. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community pharmacists have traditionally been regarded merely as suppliers and dispensers of medication. It is pretty apparent to anyone in contact with the pharmacy profession that their training fits them with skills to make a wider contribution to community health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fourth issues paper of the national health strategy on pharmaceutical drug use in Australia and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs report entitled `Prescribed health' both made very important recommendations on the issue of the wider involvement of pharmacists in managing drug use.</PARA>
<PARA>We should be conscious, above all, that elderly people today are often faced with a bewildering array of drugs, and are particularly affected by both non-compliance with instructions and by overprescribing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking for myself, honourable members will know that I have a very large number of elderly people in my own electorate on the Gold Coast.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Lucky you; so was I. Over the years, many a nursing home matron has told me of elderly patients who had been admitted to a nursing home in their charge and who were in a very poor physical and mental state.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wide array of drugs that the elderly are likely to have prescribed for them makes it very confusing indeed for them to keep clear in their minds what is required for each prescription.

All of us would understand how much more severely the matter of confusion with respect to prescription instructions would affect an elderly person, particularly if he or she were not used to having to take drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the problem does not necessarily stop at the nursing home entrance. The shadow minister raised the issue of how both pharmacists and doctors could have available to them the full amount of information they really need with respect to a patient, if they are to take preventive action with respect to inadvertent overprescribing. Senator Newman raised the possibility of the development of computer software prescribing packages for doctors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are software packages for pharmacists available which include information regarding drugs dispensed to a patient over previous years. When a new prescription is entered into the computer, it can indicate whether there is likely to be a problem between this and previous prescriptions. If such software were also available to doctors in their surgeries at the time of prescribing, the job of the pharmacist would be much easier&mdash;for example, it would eliminate difficulty in reading scripts and the safety of the patient would therefore be enhanced. In addition, the doctor would have knowledge of the record of the patient's previously dispensed pharmaceuticals, and future prescribing could take this history into account. At the moment it is possible for pharmacists to detect some problems, but it is important that the prescribing doctor also know the relevant facts before writing further prescriptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I urge the government to seriously consider the matters raised in this debate and to look to action to ensure that health professionals are encouraged to work closely together in the issuing of prescription drugs, particularly to our elderly citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be following the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) in this debate on the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2). She has raised some important points&mdash;points I had not intended to raise&mdash;challenging those involved in pharmacy, medicine, education and government to streamline the prescribing and dispensing of medicine. She quite rightly said that directions need to be clear enough for people to understand them. In this day and age there is nothing to prevent all pharmacists giving detailed information. When Roslyn Snow and I opened a pharmacy in 1981, we gave detailed information to people through a computer system that was developed by a Mr Colin Trevena as a pharmacist in Boorowa. I do not know how busy Boorowa is, but he found the time to develop an outstanding system, which later enabled him to sell his pharmacy and move into writing and setting up programs for pharmacists. These programs not only told the patient, `Here is your bottle of medicine', but also gave details of side effects, the uses of the prescription, the reasons for the dosage prescribed, and other information. It also indicated incompatibilities. The computer was able to alert the pharmacist if the patient was already taking medicine which conflicted with the newly prescribed medicine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Moncrieff said, there is no reason that such detailed information cannot be given. It is already being given by increasing numbers of pharmacists. I have said to the profession before, and I say again, that there should be more pharmacists who take the time to ensure that their patients are properly informed&mdash;and the same goes for the medical profession. The suggestion of the honourable member for Moncrieff for the use of software to assist in communication between pharmacists and doctors was an excellent one, and would help us to get away from some of the problems that exist at the moment because of poor communication. In my own experience, poor communication does create a lot of problems and can create errors, which is really inexcusable in this day and age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of people in medicine, law, academe and almost every parliament throughout Australia&mdash;myself included&mdash;have formed a group on drug law reform. The honourable member's suggestion would fit in well with its proposal that presently illegal drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and amphetamines, be prescribed under a strict regime to people who are addicted. The idea is that this would distance the use of and addiction to illegal drugs from the element of organised crime and into a health model&mdash;a very important move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the late 1940s the Chifley government, with the former Senator McKenna as the then health minister, set up a model for what we know today as the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The Menzies-Page scheme which followed really developed that scheme and got it running. Just as the Australian flag did not become official under Prime Minister Chifley, even though he was the one who legislated for it, the Chifley-McKenna pharmaceutical benefits scheme was pretty much the model for the Menzies-Page scheme, and that scheme has been the model for some time since. Although the drugs listed in it are different, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits</EMPHASIS> is not unlike the schedule to the original pharmaceutical benefits scheme of the early 50s, which was when I started in pharmacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those days the cost of drugs was rarely at the level of today's high prices, where drugs can cost up to $2,000 and $3,000. For instance, the current schedule of benefits lists an amino acid formula that costs $1,989. When people receive it for $16 they do not realise the extent to which taxpayers are funding their prescription. Similarly, pensioners and other beneficiaries who receive a concession do not always realise how much the drugs that they are receiving cost. I pay full tribute to the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett)&mdash;Australia's longest serving health minister&mdash;not only for the way in which he was able to introduce and develop Medicare, but also for the way in which he allowed the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to develop in the face of some very important challenges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's high health costs really make us think about our philosophy, about what we are going to do with the booming cost of health&mdash;that includes the cost of pharmaceutical benefits&mdash;when we have a $1.5 billion budget.

Other drugs in the current schedule of benefits include Alteplase, which costs $2,153.11; Albumaid XPXT, which costs $1,541.15; Interferon, $457.35; Goserelin, for carcinoma of the prostate, $431.81; and Epidubicin, for breast cancer, $778.02. These high prices are at present being paid not by the patients who require the items but by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at our philosophy. We are facing challenges from all directions. There are anti-carcinogenics, there are drugs for the treatment of narcolepsy, drugs for the treatment of the circulatory system and the respiratory system, the cost of which are very high. People come to see me about having an item, such as Ritalin, made available to them for the treatment of narcolepsy, a condition where people cannot stay awake. They genuinely say, `My child or I can be prescribed amphetamines'&mdash;which are addictive&mdash;`on the scheme, which are cheaper than Ritalin, but Ritalin suits us better'. Ritalin is also addictive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be able to say that, following representations from me and, I am sure, from other honourable members, Ciba-Geigy has now agreed to apply for listing of the drug Ritalin. This will please many of the narcoleptic patients who fall asleep even during their working hours. It will make a lot of difference to the life of these people. I do not include honourable members, such as yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, who have to listen to speeches such as mine, as among the sufferers. There are other reasons for honourable members falling asleep in this place, especially when we are often here from 7 in the morning till 11 at night. Having given us all a plug, there are people who cannot work a working day&mdash;getting up at 8 a.m. and returning home at 5&mdash;and stay awake, because of this illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other pressures. People who suffer pain come to us and say, `I would like Doloxene to be more freely available. It definitely relieves my pain'. That compound is also addictive. We need to say to such people that successive governments have appointed a Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, comprised of doctors and pharmacists, to advise on the items that should be available&mdash;within the budget that government provides. If we do not say that then we are not being responsible to the taxpayers. We have a very high budget of $1.5 billion. We need to say to people, `You decide what should be included within that budget'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what I frequently have to explain to people; I am sure that others do, too. In the end, it is not the minister we rely on to say what drugs should be listed. Even those of us who are pharmacists and doctors would not want to say whether a particular item should be listed. We are here as members of parliament. It is not our role to look at all the complexities and reasons for listing or de-listing benefits. Very often there are good reasons for that. I can recall when linctus morphine and some of the opiates were de-listed as benefits&mdash;for good reasons at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation specifically mentions the safety net which has been increased. Anyone who attacks the increase in the safety net forgets that it was introduced by the previous Minister for Health, who was concerned about people with chronic illnesses. He spoke to us and government policy committees frequently about his concern for these people who had chronic illnesses, had to purchase drugs continually and who would not be cured in a short time. They needed to take drugs to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enormous changes for people such as schizophrenics is borne out by the work that the former minister and other ministers have done on their behalf. Not so many years ago, schizophrenics had to be locked up in mental hospitals. They were institutionalised and often died at a young age. Today, because of the drugs that have been developed, these people can live in the community&mdash;outside institutions. As long as they take their medication they can cope with the social and working life outside institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who would have been institutionalised under dreadful conditions&mdash;they were pretty terrible conditions and still are not all that good&mdash;are able to take medicine. But they need to take the medicine all the time because there is a chemical thing going on in their minds which has to be changed, very often through chemicals. If we did not have the safety net, we would have to put up the price of the drugs to keep expenditure at $1.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The safety net needs to be a price signal. This scheme has simplified the safety net for general patients by eliminating the free limit&mdash;that gives a price signal to people&mdash;and increasing the concessional limit to $400 a year indexed. Once this amount is recorded, patients will get medicines at the concessional rate of $2.60 for the remainder of that calendar year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to our former colleague, Dr Dick Klugman, who talked about the importance of giving patients a price signal. That is what this legislation is doing; it is giving them a signal so that they know that their medicine is not free and that there is a basis for the charge. It does not hurt to point out to patients that often those costs are extremely high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system is replacing a more complex two-step safety net system under which a general patient qualified for concessional benefits after spending $312.30 on pharmaceutical benefits in a calendar year and for free benefits after spending a further $52 in that year. Now we have the limit at $400 per year. People then go onto a safety net scheme, where they pay a lower rate per prescription. This change is expected to reduce outlays by $113 million over the next four years. The government needs to be continually looking at the possibilities of savings. There is also a benefit for the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to support the legislation. It is an extension of something that was started nearly 50 years ago, when it was born in the minds of members of parliament. I pay full tribute to the late Senator McKenna and the late Sir Earle Page for the way they developed the scheme. I pay special tribute to Australian's longest serving health minister, the honourable member for Bonython, for the way he developed the scheme. Senator Richardson and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) before him also helped develop the safety net proposal and the integrity of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) outlines modifications to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme&mdash;the PBS. It provides the community with subsidised, cost-effective prescribed medications. The changes were outlined in the August federal budget and, as stated by the shadow health minister, Senator Newman, the coalition has not opposed this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 January, the safety net arrangements for general patients will change. Families will have to fill $400 in prescriptions, which is around 25 prescriptions at $16 each. Beyond this threshold there will be a fee of $2.60 for all scripts dispensed. At the moment, general patients reach a threshold of $309.90 and then pay $2.60 for scripts until they reach a second threshold of $361.50. After that, all further drugs are supplied free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although pensioners and concession card holders retain their benefits, this legislation reflects the many wider issues facing health care in Australia. The Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) cites our ageing population, a tendency for people to hoard drugs and the development of new expensive drugs for the cost blow-outs in the operation of the PBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was with reluctance that he told the Senate on 27 October that the federal government had to take this measure because, unless governments were prepared to keep the costs of pharmaceuticals under constant review and keep costs under control, universal access to drugs would be under threat. I agree. Middle Australia is bearing an extra cost for its subsidised medication, but the statistics leave us with no choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of prescriptions filled under the general safety net has doubled in past years and more than 70 per cent of the annual number of prescriptions is being supplied in</PARA>
<PARA>the last two months of the safety net period. By abolishing this second tier for general patients, the government expects to save approximately $110 million over four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government's decision obviously was taken under pressure and against a backdrop of spiralling costs of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The scheme's 1993-94 budget is nearly $1.8 billion, which represents a 10 per cent increase from last year. However, it is substantially less than the 25 per cent increase in the scheme's cost between 1991-92 and 1992-93, but still significant when compared with the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So while it is never easy to tell families that they have to pay more for their prescriptions, these changes are needed to help protect the scheme which has worked well for the past 40 years. But this bill does not provide scope for other methods to keep costs down for families affected by the legislation. It does not acknowledge all the wider forces at work, which share responsibility for the continued blow-out of costs within the PBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must clearly identify these and set priorities and strategies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For example, in 1991-92 the pharmaceutical benefits scheme's three most frequently prescribed drug groups were, in order: anti-asthmatics and antibronchitics; antihypertensives other than beta-blockers; and benzodiazepines, sedatives and hypnotics. Why were more than 6.2 million prescriptions written for benzodiazepines, sedatives and hypnotics that year? How many people in chronic pain or on our hospital waiting lists are being prescribed this medication as a stopgap measure while they await surgery?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even on face value, the high use of benzodiazepines, sedatives and hypnotics tells me that something cannot be right. Some patients unnecessarily visit more than one doctor within a short period for prescriptions for sedatives. Given the addictive nature of this group of drugs, why are so many Australians taking them, and can we do something about it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Health admitted on 27 October, there has to be a number of measures taken to educate patients, doctors and pharmacists about the proper use of medication. We need to look at our health system in the long term and educate consumers of medicine about their options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The link between poverty and health is another factor which should be considered, especially when higher levels of subsidisation are necessary for this target group. Preventive health care is important, but people need to be encouraged to take constructive attitudes towards maintaining good health and to understand the consequences of the way they choose to live. Then there is the pressing issue of Australia's rapidly growing ageing population. If we do not anticipate and plan for the growing numbers of Australia's aged population, this proposed legislation will fail miserably to keep operating costs of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme under control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures speak for themselves. Australia's pensioners, part-pensioners and concession card holders receive heavily subsidised medication. For example, antihypertensives are prescribed to treat high blood pressure, a common medical condition among the elderly. These drugs are Australia's second most frequently prescribed drug group, and the most money is spent on them. Fourteen per cent of all drug groups prescribed under the scheme come from this group at a cost of around $209 million. When we consider that in 1991 just over half the population of women aged over 60 and men aged over 65 received the age pension, and then look at the projections, we see that the case for preventive health measures becomes very obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although government policies could alter the percentage of our elderly who receive pensions in years to come, projections show that by the year 2001&mdash;honourable members should remember that is less than eight years away&mdash;there will be just over one million men aged over 65 and 1.7 million women aged over 60 in receipt of government benefits of some kind. We must do something now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the issue of generic prescribing. Under this process doctors prescribe by the generic name of the drug or by the cheapest brand name. In light of the measures we are debating tonight, we should be underpinning the minimum pricing policy with legislation which will keep costs down even further for the consumer. That is important because we should remember that these changes mean that an individual or family filling one prescription a week for the duration of the next year will pay an extra $78 for the privilege. If they fill 60 prescriptions, they will pay an extra $104 and, for 70 prescriptions, $130. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of the indirect tax increases announced in the budget, it is easy to see why we must work harder and take a long-term approach to keeping pharmaceutical costs down. Closely related to generic prescribing is generic substitution. That is the situation whereby a pharmacist swaps a prescription for a cheaper generic brand, even though the doctor may have specified a particular brand name. Once again, this indicates a need for more education. Consumers need to know that they have choices, and doctors and pharmacists need to work together to educate themselves and their patients about different drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While cost should not be the major factor in the choice of drugs, it is more important than ever that doctors consider their patients and their needs and keep up to date with pharmaceutical developments. Health Insurance Commission figures show that from June 1990 to June 1992 prescribing for premium priced brands decreased from 88 per cent to 77 per cent of the market. Prescribing for benchmark priced brands&mdash;that is, the lowest priced brands&mdash;increased from eight per cent to 13 per cent, and generic and unbranded prescribing increased from four per cent to nine per cent. I can only reiterate that we are making slow progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are arguments for and against generic prescribing and/or substitution. The elderly may get confused if the appearance or name of their medication is changed. There is debate over bioequivalence standards, or whether the pharmaceutical industry could maintain current levels of research and development. Whatever the case, we need to sort them out and stop dragging our feet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been considering changes to the generic drug prescribing policy since 1987.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Prescribing health</EMPHASIS> made many recommendations in the areas I have been discussing tonight. Let us take just one of these recommendations. It was suggested that the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, as part of its health research activities, `dedicate resources to investigate overall savings to the community and the health system from the better usage of drugs'. The government said in its response to the report that these investigations are hampered by unreliable statistical health data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare is now developing a national health information agreement so that Commonwealth, state and territory health and statistical authorities improve, maintain and share health information.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same with the suggestion that all prescription drugs carry labels with the generic name one point size larger than the brand name.

I am talking about HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hobart</EMPHASIS>, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Perth</EMPHASIS>, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brisbane</EMPHASIS> and HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vendetta</EMPHASIS>, which were the destroyers involved, and HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> clearance diving team 3, the RAN helicopter flight Vietnam, RAN detachment 9 Squadron RAAF and Australian force logistic support. It is really quite surprising for most people to learn that the personnel strength of the Royal Australian Navy for Vietnam in January 1972 was 17,192. It is interesting, too, that those four destroyers steamed exactly 397,484 miles. In the course of their voyages they fired 102,546 rounds. They had replenishments at sea on 655 occasions and received enemy fire 17 times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contribution made by the RAN helicopter flight was also outstanding. From October 1967 to June 1971 it amassed something like 33,724 Royal Australian Navy pilot flying hours. Also, the navy detachment to 9 Squadron RAAF amassed, from February 1968 to May 1969, 4,908 pilot flying hours&mdash;a very substantial contribution indeed. I must mention too that the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>&mdash;although not all of these miles involved Vietnam&mdash;in that period steamed a total of 345,650 miles. It made 22 voyages; it carried 16,094 troops, cargo weighing a total of 5,753 tonnes and 2,375 vehicles. So it is quite obvious that without the Royal Australian Navy the efforts of our troops in that theatre would have been severely hampered, and probably the troops could not have existed at all. At the same time, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jeparit</EMPHASIS> made 42 voyages, steamed a total of 409,289 miles and carried 173,820 tonnes of cargo. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Boonaroo</EMPHASIS> made two voyages, steamed 20,885 miles and carried 6,732 tonnes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The office of public prosecutor is an ancient and very honourable office. The public prosecutor within the English common law system has long been independent and is part of the separation of powers between our political and judicial systems. Yet in Victoria the Kennett government has examined a proposed bill&mdash;we do not know the determination of the cabinet&mdash;which would effectively castrate the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Victoria and which would leave that office open to political control. One must ask&mdash;and I think this House should ask&mdash;why this is so. What is the background of the Victorian Liberal government's desire to take away the independence of the most important role of the Director of Public Prosecutions? I will be mentioning the name `Elliott' in this speech, but I advise the House that I am aware of the sub judice rule. I am aware that today in the Federal Court proceedings are taking place on that matter, and I will not breach that rule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very interesting point about this matter is to be found in the transcripts of the hearing in Melbourne before the Federal Court, and particularly the transcripts dated 4 November 1993. It has been disclosed in the press that solicitors acting for Mr Elliott wrote letters to the Victorian minister for police, Mr Pat McNamara, suggesting that the Victorian department of public prosecutions was not necessarily acting in the right way and, because it was a matter of grave public importance, he should intervene with the police. But what is not widely known, and what has not been reported in the media, is that not just one letter was written to the Victorian minister on behalf of Mr Elliott&mdash;three letters were written. That was revealed in the transcripts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transcripts revealed that on 27 September 1993 a solicitor, Mr Aarons, wrote a letter to the Attorney-General, Mrs Jan Wade, which was delivered by hand. On the same day we have public knowledge of the fact that Mr Aarons also wrote to the minister for police. What is not widely known is that on 28 November a further letter was written by Mr Aarons to Mr McNamara in his capacity as minister for police. In that letter Mr Aarons enclosed what I regard as a shonky legal opinion&mdash;shonky in the view of any lawyer who wants to read it&mdash;which calls for if not the removal then the suspension of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Bongiorno. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think anyone who has the administration of justice at heart must be very concerned that here we have a lawyer acting for a person who was seeking to avoid a potential prosecution writing to a state Attorney-General and to a state police minister to intervene against the Director of Public Prosecutions and enclosing a shonky legal opinion calling for the suspension or, worse, dismissal of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Then, very shortly after 28 November, the state cabinet of the Kennett government in Victoria considered a bill&mdash;and we do not know the determination of the cabinet on that bill&mdash;which would effectively take away the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions. One can only ask, `Why?'. Who else, apart from solicitors acting on behalf of Mr Elliott, has written a letter or given any detail to the Kennett government, which has called for this action?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first point tonight is on a naval matter. I refer the House to a program earlier this month which referred to the sinking of the cruiser HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> during World War II. In the last few days, I received a letter from one of my constituents about that matter. I read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record what that constituent said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last night on television there was a `Special', regarding HMAS SYDNEY. For many years now I have been interested in this matter, as has my father who was serving on HMAS SYDNEY until a `posting' immediately prior to the last voyage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know from my own Naval service and attending ANZAC DAY Reunions with my father, that the fate of the SYDNEY is still foremost in the minds of those who have served in her.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a lot of doubt regarding the circumstances surrounding the loss of the SYDNEY and of course the television show did nothing to remove any doubts. There were several matters raised which I feel do have merit and are the reason I have put pen to paper to my Member of Parliament for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first matter is that of the unidentified body currently buried without a headstone. I, like the investigator, cannot understand why identification of the body cannot be carried out through dental records which the R.A.N still maintain, nor can I understand why the grave has never had a headstone. Surely we can arrange identification of the body and then arrange a correct burial with honours. At least one family will know what happened to their son/father.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other matter is that of an estimated $750,000 it would cost to locate the SYDNEY in a matter of days. I believe that this is a small sum to pay and maybe we may be able to get some answers to questions which still linger. Damage may be able to show whether torpedoes were used and if there was more than one torpedo it may point to a submarine involved in the action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know that my father is still investigating the SYDNEY loss and recently travelled to Canberra and checked archives trying to find some answers. I also know that many other people are in the same situation, maybe now is the time to put this matter to rest.</PARA>
<PARA>Tomorrow I will be writing to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to ask that he investigate some of these matters. I hope that before long we can have some light thrown on the mystery of the sinking of that cruiser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to a quite different subject. Last week in Toowoomba it was a pleasure for me to attend the launching, at the University of Southern Queensland, of an impact statement on the Toowoomba economy by that university. As I understand it, it is the first university&mdash;certainly the first provincial university&mdash;to issue such an economic impact statement. I congratulate Professor Barry Leal, Vice-Chancellor of that university, for the initiative. In the executive statement that was released, he commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A university is primarily an educational institution and its principal contribution to the community of which it is part relates to the excellence of its teaching and research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the presence of a university in a region also brings considerable economic benefits. This fact is well recognised by most business people in Toowoomba, but the extent of the benefits brought to the city by the University of Southern Queensland has largely remained a matter of conjecture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Report, the result of an extended study by several members of the USQ staff, puts an end to such conjecture by identifying with considerable precision the nature of the economic contribution that USQ makes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Richard Temple-Smith of the faculty of business, Mr Norm Elvidge of the faculty of arts, and the research assistants for the great work that they have done. I intend to raise some of the detail of this impact statement with the appropriate ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to record my support for the government's initiatives to encourage people with disabilities to participate fully in all aspects of community activity&mdash;the world of work and the world of recreation. Since the introduction of the disability reform package in 1991, the government has continued to develop its strategy to overcome structural and attitudinal barriers in the community. The goals set in 1991 are on target: 4,500 places each year in the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service for disability support pensioners in 1993-94; 8,000 Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service places for sickness allowance recipients in 1992-93; 8,000 places through DEET in labour market programs each year; and 1,200 places for people with psychiatric disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) in the last sitting reiterated the government's support for the effective reintegration of people with psychiatric disabilities following the Burdekin report. By 1993-94, 4,000 supported and competitive employment and training places will be created through the disability services program. The Commonwealth-state disability agreement&mdash;the focus of the Commonwealth's activity&mdash;separates employment creation from accommodation and other support services and will be the target of state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, the disability discrimination legislation of 1992 has provided national protection against discrimination on the grounds of disability. Last week the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, Elizabeth Hastings, visited Central Queensland. In her speech, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Act makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of physical, intellectual, psychiatric, sensory, neurological and learning disability. It also makes it unlawful to discriminate against people because they have some physical disfigurement, or because of the presence in their bodies of an organism capable of causing disease. This provision includes, for example, people with HIV/AIDS.</PARA>
<PARA>It was pleasing to renew an acquaintance that went back over 20 years when we were both on campus at the University of Melbourne. Elizabeth made the point at a breakfast with members of the Rockhampton Chamber of Commerce that people with disabilities constitute 16 per cent of the population, and with family, friends and colleagues make up 25 per cent of the community. In this way, they are a sizeable market and meeting their needs makes good business sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elizabeth visited the Mount Hay gemstone tourist park which recently received the Prime Minister's award as employer of the year for small business because of its contribution in employing people with a range of disabilities in its workshop. The workshop creates fine pewter statues for the tourist market and these little ornaments are in fact on sale here at the Parliament House shop. The managers were delighted to receive the award and told me that all their staff work together excellently as a team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CCQ personnel and the Capricorn Tourism and Development Organisation were instrumental in developing the initiative, with CQ personnel providing the selection, training and backup support which has made this venture so successful. Of course, it was funded by the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another employer nominated for the award was ACME Fine Furniture&mdash;a Brisbane firm. It has been delighted with the positive contribution that its employees with disabilities have made both to its productivity and to good group feeling in the workplace. These two examples indicate the excellent contribution people with disabilities can make to the workplace once given the opportunity and the backup support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Sunday, prior to flying to Canberra, I attended carols in the caves at Olsen's limestone caves just north of Rockhampton. This special event held each Christmas is arranged by Access Recreation. I was delighted to see the effort put in by Olsen's caves to provide access for people with physical disabilities. It was a pleasure to share with many people from Rockhampton the true Christmas spirit in a natural limestone cave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another event attended by Elizabeth was the renaming of Birribi, which is a residential care facility for people with profound physical and intellectual disabilities. It is very important that, as we reintegrate people with disabilities into the community, we do not forget those in our community who need special care on a 24-hour basis. I want to close by quoting again from what Elizabeth had to say in relation to the legislation. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People with disabilities now have a piece of legislation designed to meet the reality of our experience as we try to lead ordinary lives; it is based on the principle of equality before the law and as human beings; it is not a welfare or service provision Act, but one which assumes the person with the disability is, and should expect to be, a full participant in the social, economic and political life of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recently received a letter from a constituent about ex-prisoners of war and their efforts to obtain a special pension. He wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are only a few of us left these days, most of us approaching 80 years.</PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, it is a wonder that there are so many of these veterans still with us, considering the treatment and deprivation of even the most basic needs that were meted out to them in the vast majority of cases. There are in fact some 7,500 still living&mdash;4,800 or so were prisoners of the Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1952, the government set up a prisoner of war trust fund and paid up to #250 per person&mdash;or $5,100 at today's value&mdash;to those who had suffered exceptional hardship as POWs and who needed financial assistance. The fund was wound up in 1977, having disbursed almost $1 million. Not all POWs, therefore, received this payment or any other payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1952 and 1963, prisoners of war of the Japanese received a total of #102 10s each&mdash;in today's money, worth around $2,080. The final outlay totalled the relatively token amount of about #2.2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1987-88 budget, 27 ex-POWs who had been held in Nazi concentration camps received a non-taxable lump sum of $10,000 each. All ex-POWs were provided with full treatment benefits for all medical conditions, including unlimited dental treatment, and in 1992 the war widows and widowers pensions were extended to cover the widows and widowers of ex-POWs. This extension entitled them to a range of benefits which they had not enjoyed previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1992, the then minister announced that the current special arrangements for prisoners of war detained in Japan would be extended to those prisoners of war from the European and Korean theatres of war. There were no Australian prisoners of war from Vietnam. However, as we approach 1994&mdash;nearly 50 years after World War II and more than 40 years since Korea&mdash;it is long overdue that the government should adopt a consistent approach to ex-prisoners of war rather than these seemingly begrudging, ad hoc benefits that have been given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While these benefits have been welcome, ex-prisoners of war do not feel that their sacrifices and deprivations have been fairly acknowledged. It is inconsistent, for example, that members of the armed forces were paid subsistence allowances when deprived of food and accommodation, and proficiency allowances, but that those allowances were denied to prisoners of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 11 October last, the Ex-Prisoners of War Association of Australia held its federal conference, where it was resolved to make a submission to the government. Max Jagger, the national president, and Sid Marshall, the New South Wales president of the Ex-Prisoners of War Association, have advised me that they will be requesting an additional pension based on 50 per cent of the general rate for all prisoners of war except those already receiving the extreme disability allowance or the totally and permanently incapacitated allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An extra pension based on 50 per cent of the general rate is an equitable request. Those already receiving the extreme disability allowance and TPI allowance are content to remain on their present pensions as they believe they are adequately compensated, but they fully support the claim of their fellow ex-prisoners of war to this special extra pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As June Healy, the dynamic national secretary of the RSL in Canberra, has said, returned service personnel are special people, but ex-prisoners of war are a special group within a group of special people. These veterans returned to Australia and got on with their lives but, as they are ageing, the extreme deprivation suffered through their often inhuman incarceration when they were just young men and women has begun to take its toll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is really no compensation adequate for their suffering. Their survival is quite miraculous. They are now elderly, their numbers are dwindling and the pension they now claim is not only a reasonable recognition of their bravery and endurance, but the proper payment of a long overdue debt owed to them by the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that these matters should have been addressed many years ago, but that is no excuse. This parliament must honour the promises made by previous governments and rectify what has been a major injustice.

Tomorrow evening, the Port Stephens council will consider a rezoning application to allow a proposed development for 17,000 people to be established on a coastal dune formation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I expressed previously, this report recommended a holistic and integrated approach.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision makers on the Fern Bay development should be aware of one of the basic conclusions in this report, namely, that we must exercise greater vision than we have in the past. We can no longer afford the pretension that different governments, different arms of administration, can proceed in their own ways, and that the results will be good. Decisions should be made on the basis that the long view prevails over the short; that prudence should take the place of expediency; and that broad considerations should be the order of the day. It is imperative that the decision makers of this development take stock and address the strategies outlined in this report before proceeding to resolve this development application. Given the fragility of this zone, a national approach to its management is of critical importance. The development of a coastal park may be a more appropriate outcome for this delightful piece of coastline. The Port Stephens council should investigate this option through a consultative community process. I also remind the Port Stephens council that Port Stephens is already the No. 1 tourist destination in the Hunter and that this coastal park would only enhance its standing. </PARA>

Yarraman has been a part of Queensland's history since 1898. It has held its own against the odds time after time. In these times of economic crisis, particularly for rural communities, it is great to see what has happened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Since SBS's inception first as a radio broadcaster, and then from 1980 as a radio and television broadcaster, its logo was never standard across the organisation. The logo was changed primarily to present a unified image to the public and to unify the radio and television operations under one banner. The logo change was also planned to mark the organisation's incorporation (which occurred on 23 December 1992) and to coincide with the move to new premises at Artarmon (during the first half of 1993) which in any case would have necessitated the production of new stationery.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) On 22 December 1992 I wrote to both the Hon Garry West MP, the then NSW Minister for Forests and the Hon Chris Hartcher, NSW Minister for the Environment outlining action necessary to meet the conservation initiatives of the National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An inquiry into charitable organisations was one of a number of public inquiries foreshadowed in the Treasurer's 1992 announcement of the Industry Commission's forward work program. The inquiry will commence when the Government sends the terms of reference to the Commission. As with all public inquiries undertaken by the Commission, the nature, timetable and procedures for the inquiry will be widely publicised so as to encourage participation by interested parties. The Inquiry process will be transparent and will involve public hearings and the publication of a draft report on which anyone may comment.</PARA>

The number of support staff may vary over the period of the inquiry, and may involve around ten staff initially. The Commission already has an office in Melbourne supporting a number of inquiries. The staff on this inquiry would be drawn from that office. Necessary expenditure on travel and other administrative costs for the inquiry will be controlled by Commissioners and met in the usual way from the Commission's budget appropriation. The need for overseas visits in order to answer the terms of reference is a matter for the Commissioners to consider.</PARA>
