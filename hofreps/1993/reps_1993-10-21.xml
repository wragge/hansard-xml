<TITLE>Unified Vietnamese Buddhist Church</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament Assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Petition of the Undersigned Shows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) One of the most critical issues to the Vietnamese people today is the persecution of their freedom of religion and expression, carried out by the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (GOSRV) which has increased greatly since 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) While this policy of persecution has applied equally to Catholics, Protestants, Caodaists, Hoa Hao Buddhist members, the Unified Vietnamese Buddhist Church (UBCV) which represents the faith of 80% of Vietnamese is most seriously persecuted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang of the UBCV has been held under strict house arrest since February 1982. The GOSRV has in the last few months, ordered stricter surveillance of the Patriarch's place of confinements and placed bans on all of his external communications. Whoever, tries to contact him are stopped threatened, interrogated, and searched etc. The Patriarch's appeals have been ignored by the Hanoi leaders, and also vilified as "anti-state", "reactionary" "creating division amongst Buddhist community" etc by the GOSRV's mass media and its nation-wide agencies including its own State run Vietnamese Buddhist Church (VBC) who include in its charter "Socialism" as a third aim of service in addition to "People" and "Buddhism".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The UBCV's clergy and lay members who openly declare their support for the UBCV's appeals and who have worked sincerely for the reconciliation between the State and the UBCV, also between the VBC and the UBCV, have been inhumanely and violently attacked by the GOSRV. In the last 12 months, hundreds of monks, nuns and lay persons have been arrested and or tortured, harshly interrogated, searched, investigated and threatened. Amongst them are the Venerables Thich Nhat Lien, Thich Tri Luc and Thich Khong Tanh (Oct-Nov 1992), Thich Thien An (Oct 1992, tortured to death a few days after arrest), Thich Hai Tang,  Thich Tri Tuu, Thich Hai Thinh and about 50 lay members (5/6/93), Thich Hanh Duc, 17 other monks and about 100 lay followers (9/7/93) etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) To politicise the traditional Buddhist community in Vietnam, the GOSRV has publicly been, and are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) recruiting members for the VBC by forcibly converting the UBCV's moderate clergy to join it, and arresting or exiling other leaders who refuse to do so;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) appointing VBC senior leaders to artificial political positions, and controlling and intervening in training programs such as ordination procedures, seniority promotions etc.;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) requiring the VBC to make frequent political statements supporting the GOSRV's inconsistent policies;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) directing the VBC to start a nation-wide campaign to accusing the UBCV of having political ambitions, and forcing it to declare the VBC as the "only legitimate Buddhist authority" and its "everlasting loyalty" to the GOSRV.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners request that the House of Representatives should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Make conditional the release of currently approved financial assistance and any future aid to the GOSRV, on its granting of all internationally accepted human and civil rights to its people without discrimination. This must be demonstrated by the GOSRV through its complete cessation of persecution in any form of all religious organisations, particularly of the UBCV.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Urge the GOSRV to cease all ill-treatment of the UBCV and to achieve a mutually acceptable reso2330</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">lution, by means of fair negotiation of all appeals made by the UBCV's Patriarch.3. Make clear statements requesting the GOSRV:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) not to conduct any further suppression of those who non-violently demonstrate their beliefs and involvement with their chosen religious organisations;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) immediately release all who are under arrest, with or without trials, because of their religious beliefs, including the Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang and other clergy; the GOSRV should also cease their accusations directed towards the UBCV leaders claims to religious freedom and the Church's independent status;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) completely withdraw its politicization of religions and its intervention in the internal affairs of religious bodies such as supporting the VBC whilst inhumanely oppressing the UBCV or by using the official mass media to create staged scenes dishonouring and defaming holders of religious authorities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the explanatory memorandum to the Privacy Amendment Bill 1993. I think the House deserves an explanation as to why I should be presenting this bill and what it is all about. The bill makes absolutely clear that the Privacy Act is not to interfere with honourable members pursuing their duties as members. If I may put it more bluntly, the one thing I think honourable members on both sides of the House really value is their constituency work and trying to negotiate difficulties or changes on behalf of constituents. This bill makes it absolutely clear that no bureaucrat can stand in the way of that important responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a matter of history, some two years ago the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and I, following a number of complaints or problems that we were suffering from departments about the Privacy Act, spoke to the then Attorney-General and later to the Privacy Commissioner. Whilst the Privacy Commissioner acknowledged these problems, he sought the opportunity to discuss the matter and the guidelines with the relevant departments. His clear view was that the Privacy Act should not be used to thwart members of parliament in the legitimate pursuit of the interests of their constituents. I think two years is a fair enough period for the Privacy Commissioner, with the departmental heads, to have sorted this problem out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret to say that I still continue to have officers from a couple of departments write to me from time to time saying that they cannot in any way assist me or my constituents because of the application of the Privacy Act. What is really annoying to me is that some of the newer members who came here after the election in 1993 have been advised that they must conform to the pre-existing system that we complained so bitterly about two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, there were no special steps that the Privacy Commissioner took to ensure that new members would not be subjected to the frustrations that some bureaucrats undertake from time to time. Hence this bill. Probably the most important principle of our democracy is that members of parliament, particularly in this chamber, the people's house, ought to be able&mdash;in an unhindered, unimpeded way&mdash;to pursue the legitimate interests and concerns of their constituents with various departments and agencies without being inhibited in any way. I would even say the same of the Senate and its senators and I invite them to look at this draft bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If members of this parliament cannot free themselves of the Privacy Act by adopting the amendment that I propose to the Privacy Bill, what are we here for? If we cannot represent our constituents, what are we here for? This is an issue that would attract support, I believe, not only from both sides of this chamber but also from the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have advised the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) of the implications of this bill and why I am proposing it. I have given him an advanced copy of the bill and I sincerely hope that he, together with other members of the executive, takes up the issues that are raised in this bill and that he does not delay but acts promptly. All it requires is for the government to pick up the bill on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and have it moved. I cannot do it. I cannot bring forward a vote in this chamber. I and my colleagues, fellow backbenchers, are totally dependent on the executive to preserve what I have always believed to be the very basic reason why we claim to be people's representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I feel very passionately that the Attorney-General, together with cabinet members, should take an interest in this issue and should resolve it. There is one way to resolve it once and for all, and that is the adoption of this bill. I commend the bill to the House. I would like to commend it to the Senate but, most particularly, I invite the Attorney-General to take prompt action. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YU5">Mr TANNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I have great pleasure in moving this motion. The Australian award system is based on a recognition that bargaining power in the employment contract is intrinsically unequal and in many instances grossly unequal. The system is based on a rejection of the notion that the employment contract is just like any other contract, like the contract to purchase a sack of potatoes or any other usual commercial contract in our society. It is based on a recognition that the employment contract underpins the entire economic and social structure of our society. It is the most dominant factor in social relationships in our community. It illustrates the validity of that great dictum of R.H. Tawney, the British historian, that `freedom for the pike is death for the minnow'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The award system is designed to protect the economically and industrially weak and to ensure that there is a reasonable standard of living and a reasonable standard of remuneration for workers in our community. The Australian award system has been a key factor in ensuring that even now, in spite of all of the market pressures impelling our society towards a less equal society where there are greater disparities of wealth and income, by and large in Australia we live in is one society and not two, as is the case in many countries overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has ensured to a very substantial extent that the industrially weak are protected from exploitation, particularly in smaller workplaces. The award system and its enforcement are of course not perfect: there are instances of breaches of the award; there are instances where people get away with breaches; but, by and large, the system has ensured that exploitation is relatively uncommon in this country, at least in grosser forms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has ensured a flatter wage structure than exists in most comparable countries and, ironically, we are now in a situation where the relatively lower rates of pay for our managerial class are in fact becoming a source of competitive advantage for Australia, as illustrated by the recently released strategy by the government to attract to Australia regional head offices planning to operate in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The award system has also provided some restraint on the pure market power of the industrially strong and militant&mdash;something that honourable members on the other side may find difficult to accept. But the accord process has been a good illustration of how a collective approach to wage fixing in this country has meant that the minority of employees in the society who do have genuine market power and industrial strength have not exploited that to the maximum extent that they might have because of a collective sense of obligation to others who are less powerful in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The award system also provides employers with a level playing field with respect to the terms and conditions of their employees. It removes the prospect of exploitation as an aspect of competitive behaviour and it means that the focus of attempts by employers to improve their competitiveness must be elsewhere. This was the original aim of the founders of the system in the 1890s, particularly in Victoria, who were, to a substantial extent, employers. They were people who did not want to compete on the basis of exploitation, people who often had a moral and religious commitment to paying decent wages to their employees and wanted to ensure that they were not being undercut by competitors who were prepared to exploit. That has been the moral foundation of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also provides a means whereby smaller employers are relieved from the paperwork, the bureaucracy, the complexity of having to engage in complicated negotiations and dealings with respect to tiny details in employment contract matters. There are many small business people in our community who are quite happy to see the award system continue because it presents a level playing field on employment matters, and it ensures that they do not have to spend a large amount of their time in direct negotiations on these matters and that they can get on with running their businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many myths are peddled about the award system, and in the relatively brief time that I have I will deal with a few of them. The first is that 70 per cent of the private sector work force is ununionised and therefore the trade union movement and the award system should have no relevance to them. The fact is that a very substantial proportion of this 70 per cent are workers in very small enterprises where, purely for logistic reasons, it is very difficult to unionise them and to service them as union members. The decline in union membership in the private sector is essentially a phenomenon caused by structural change in the work force rather than by workers leaving the union movement by choice. Previously, highly unionised areas have shown slow job growth and lightly unionised areas have shown high job growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also widespread intimidation by employers of employees directed at persuading them not to join unions. This can sometimes be quite blatant. I have seen it; I have been there; I have spoken to many people; I have experienced it directly. It is widespread. It is sometimes gross; it is sometimes more subtle. One of the most common myths that we find in many workplaces is when a new employee starts work there and some boss says, `Oh, somebody tried to get the union in here a few years ago and they got sacked'. Often very subtle means are used to dissuade employees from joining unions. I have experienced this directly, personally, in many instances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a myth that awards are a barrier to efficiency. The Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey, a very widespread survey of many businesses in this country, the most comprehensive of its kind ever done, indicated that only seven per cent of managers in Australia described the award system as a barrier to the achievement of greater efficiency. In a big proportion of the non-unionised award areas, the major issues that are problems for efficiency, such as demarcation disputes and some of the more complex provisions with respect to penalty rates and workplace restrictive practices, simply are not relevant; they do not apply. The vast majority of small workplaces are covered by one award and one union. Classic examples of this are solicitors' offices, accountants' offices and real estate agents' offices, where issues like penalty rates and demarcations and so on simply do not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the suggestion that there is a widespread demand for freedom to bargain; that there are thousands of employers out there desperately seeking to make efficiency improvements that the award system is restricting them from doing. Where are they? Who are they? There is the myth that there are thousands of ununionised workers out there who are desperately straining at the leash to get themselves out of the award system. Where are they? Who are they? Let us see them. The fact is that they do not exist. Opinion polls show overwhelming support for the award system in our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Productivity is an important criterion in determining wage changes but it cannot be the only criterion, because there are many workers in our society for whom measuring productivity is extremely difficult. How do we measure the productivity of a secretary, a bartender, a shop assistant or a truck driver? Is a truck driver more productive because he drives faster or cuts more corners? It is easier to measure certain types of workers' productivity than others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is suggested that award rates of pay costs jobs; let wage rates fall and employers will employ more people. Employers employ in response to demand. They employ when there is work to be done, not because they have suddenly got a bit of extra money lying around enabling them to employ more people. Cutting wages reduces demand and it redistributes income to the better off without actually creating further jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to accept that those in employment do have to bear the cost of finding jobs for those who are not in employment. However, if we do that through reductions in wages then those least able to pay&mdash;the lower paid&mdash;will bear the cost, whereas if we do it through the tax system those best able to pay will bear the cost. Most non-unionised jobs affected by the award system are not in the trade exposed sector and, therefore, questions of efficiency, competition with Asia and the like are much less significant than they are in a number of other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If lower wages equal jobs, why is it that Japan is a high wage country with low unemployment and Ireland is a low wage country with high unemployment? Across the world there are examples of variations of this equation of all shapes and sizes. What that illustrates is that there is no simple connection. There are many factors that apply in this equation and it is a lot more complex than the simplistic nonsense we hear from those who would allow employers to exploit workers and abandon the award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Abandoning the award system would lead to widespread exploitation, the development of a $5-an-hour economy for many workers in this country, and a great increase in inequality and injustice. The victims would often be hidden. They would not have the means of redressing the situation. They would just have to cop it, as is the case in many societies overseas, including the United States. In many places, employers have overwhelming power, and the threat of dismissal prevents people from doing anything about it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this motion in the instance that the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) accepts an amendment which would read substantially `that notwithstanding the above this House supports the unequivocal and total deregulation of the industrial relations system'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Melbourne has introduced into this House a most important concept. He has brought into this place a discussion about retaining a most antiquated, outmoded, bureaucratically driven industrial relations system which is full of more rigidities and constraints than exist anywhere else in the industrialised world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is supposed to be developing a modern, outward looking, open economy, and yet within the scenario of trying to knock down the wall around this country we have retained a controlled and fixed labour market in the name of the accord and in the name of the award system, and we have perpetrated an outrageous deception upon the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are denying Australians jobs. Almost one million men and women in Australia cannot find jobs, and they are prevented from being in an expanding, burgeoning economy because of an antiquated award system. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) will next week introduce into this place legislation which will not only retain the award system but enhance it, make it stronger and give more power to the trade unions so that they can control every aspect of this vital issue which is of importance to industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his motion, the honourable member for Melbourne talks about exploitation. We hear about exploitation of the workers by the bosses. This is 18th century or 19th century-type stuff. It is Industrial Revolution-type stuff. We are not talking about 21st century human relations. We are not talking about what is really happening out there in the modern workplace, in the small and medium sized businesses and in some large industries where management and workers together make decisions about how they will do their work, how they will be paid and when they will not work. These are very important considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, instead of that kind of modern flexible system that allows people freedom of choice, the honourable member for Melbourne wants not only to retain the constraints of our bureaucratic system but also to enhance them. We have debated in this place for hour after endless hour a cartel that existed in this country with respect to one of our major export products and one of Australia's finest and most important commodities&mdash;that is, wool. What happened to the wool cartel? The wool cartel failed, did it not, as all cartels fail, do they not? Why did it fail? Because one side got too greedy. It asked for too much money and the cartel failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I maintain that what is happening today&mdash;particularly in light of the bill that will be introduced by the Minister for Industrial Relations shortly in this place&mdash;is that we are overbalancing this antiquated bureaucratic control system, and the cartel, which it is, will fail. Why? Because we will now give the unions so much power, we will so overbalance the system, that it is doomed to massive failure. How long do I give it? I do not know. After a year&mdash;two at the most&mdash;the whole thing will collapse upon itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new bill is going to break new ground in Australia by using the external affairs power of the constitution in order to give faceless Geneva bureaucrats&mdash;the International Labour Organisation&mdash;control over the lives of ordinary Australians to the extent that has never been seen before in history. We are breaking new constitutional ground in Australia because, from now on, from the day that those opposite ram that bill through this House, anything will be fair game&mdash;social security, defence, agriculture, mining, industry. No policy will any longer be sacrosanct. All will be subject to international conventions at the whim and caprice of this Labor government with its Keating dominated executive. ILO conventions mean faceless Geneva bureaucrats taking control of Australia's agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What will those opposite do? This is in the name of protection. As I read the minister's statement over and over again, we see the word `protection'. In just about every other sentence, we get the word `protection'. What we are doing in the name of supposedly building a competitive economy is building a cocoon around the work force and saying that somehow bureaucrats know better what is good for John Doe at factory X in the suburbs of Melbourne than does the worker himself or herself. That is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Melbourne talks about the rights of people to maintain their place in trade unions and says that the bosses try to remove from them that right; they try to talk them out of belonging to the union. I suspect that that does not happen very often. But I will tell the House what does happen every day of every week of every month of every year: that is, the unions go out and intimidate and force individuals who do not wish to be members of a union to be unionised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill of the Minister for Industrial Relations&mdash;while it will ensconce in legislation the requirement that no individual shall induce an employee to leave membership of a union&mdash;has no counter requirement that no union official or others shall induce an employee to become a member of a union. Why not? Is that fair? Is that balanced? Of course it is not. It is another nonsense of ensconcing in legislation the rigidities and the constraints that are already built into this fixed award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the way the system operates, most Australians would be absolutely outraged if they realised the detailed bureaucratic and quasi-legal procedures that one must go through in order to change relationships at a workplace. We talk about enterprise flexibility clauses in the awards! One must go through weeks and months of negotiation; and one must meet the fine details of the legal requirements of the bill, of the act and of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. There are something like 19 separate tests that must be passed with the concurrence of a trade union before a group of employees and their management can make an agreement on how they are going to work in their shop in the suburbs of Melbourne. What an absolutely outrageous nonsense! And we talk about the need for productivity!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">OECD data recently has drafted Australian unit labour costs against the increases in productivity. The unit labour costs are going up like a rocket, while the productivity, the growth, is so slow as to be almost immeasurable. Why is that? Why is the growth so slow? Why are new jobs not being found? It is because we have this archaic, rigid system&mdash;in which everyone is supposed to work&mdash;which allows no real flexibility at all. Awards are nothing more than bureaucratic mechanisms under the control of bureaucratic unions in order to decide the fate of individual workplaces. At a time when we need flexibility, productivity and enterprise&mdash;all things that could help make us a great nation, could give us new jobs and higher productivity, could improve our balance of payments, could help solve our debt problem, could in fact help turn this country around&mdash;instead of heading in a flexible way, the honourable member wants to perpetuate a myth. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Again, what a terrible thing for a national government to do, to say that women working in the Australian work force should, of right, have the opportunity to take leave when they are having children. It is not that long ago that the people opposite of a conservative political persuasion, when they were in government, in fact not only did not support that view but for their own employees ensured it did not happen. Only 20 years ago state conservative governments sacked their female public servants when they were pregnant. That is a fact. It is about time, 20 years down the track, that we were past that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that we intend to legislate for is the minimum wage. As I understand it, this comes under the corporations power. I would have thought those opposite  supported a mimimum wage because they went to the last election proposing to do precisely that, except they were going to legislate for a minimum wage of $3 an hour for young Australians. That is what honourable members opposite were going to do. They thought it was a good idea to use the corporations power to legislate in the federal parliament to set that minimum wage, so they should not complain about the process. They were going to use the same process, but they were going to use it to provide $3 an hour for young Australians. It is a matter of record that the people of Australia rejected that resoundingly at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of examples I could give about flexibility that have occurred in the current arrangements and they have been widely reported in the press. In the four minutes remaining to me in this debate I do not think I will have the opportunity to do that, but I look forward to the opportunity to put on the record a number of innovative and productive changes in the workplace that have occurred in recent years under our existing industrial relations system. They are a matter of record and they are widely understood&mdash;and, I believe, understood by those opposite who find it convenient, however, to overlook that in debates of these sorts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about flexibility, the flexibility those opposite seek to encourage in the workplace is the flexibility to reduce conditions. The current system, which will be enhanced by the new legislation that the Labor government will introduce in this session, provides a wide range of opportunities to have flexible conditions of employment that do not in the aggregate reduce the general remuneration to workers. We can have flexibility to lift benefits, to change them across the spectrum, to introduce new ones, and to trade off one condition for another, but we do not have flexibility to push down the standard of living of individual workers. But let there be no doubt, that is in fact the agenda of the conservative parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Troubleshooters organisation has been supported by many speakers of the opposition here in this House and publicly, including the shadow minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). Troubleshooters very conveniently put out a document at the end of last year in which Graeme Haycroft, who is involved with that organisation&mdash;he was the chairperson of the National Party's industrial relations committee in Queensland so he should be known to honourable members on that side of the House&mdash;extolled the virtues of Troubleshooters which, he said, proposed doing away with all the problems that the award system created, therefore providing flexibility. Let us strip the code away and look at what it means. The Troubleshooters document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What are the savings to employers?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The employer no longer has to worry about . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Then it lists 12 things that employers no longer have to worry about. They no longer have to worry about penalty rates; the training guarantee levy; workers compensation; union superannuation; payroll tax; holiday pay&mdash;the Graeme Haycroft Troubleshooters' opposition-supported proposal does away with holiday pay; long service leave&mdash;they do not want that and it is done away with; sick pay&mdash;if workers get sick and cannot go to work they just do not get paid, an easy solution; redundancy pay; group tax deductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document then lists `stupid union Award rules' that would be done away with, such as: preference; seniority; maternity leave&mdash;they do not want any of this maternity leave stuff because people who get pregnant can just go out of the work force; paternity leave; and special allowances. Finally, the employer would no longer have to worry about unfair dismissal or any backdated claim against the employer. They do not want a situation where an unfair dismissal might be adjudicated by a commission and an employee's rights reinstated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the prescription, in black and white, of Troubleshooters. That is the prescription the opposition took to the people of Australia at the last election. The people of Australia understood that fact and responded, `We do not want a bar of it'.

It is worth recording that when Higgins set up the basis of the arbitration system it was what was called `fair and reasonable' wage determination and was not based on productivity. As time has gone by, `fair and reasonable' has grown to unsustainable proportions&mdash;right through into the 1970s and 1980s, when there was a real head of steam within the labour markets and the wage structures in Australia blew out completely. </PARA>

<PARA>It is fair to say that that has never been really picked up in terms of the trade union movement of Australia. It is also fair to say that the award system bears no relationship at all to productivity but indeed to the ability of trade unions to push and pressure the business community to give as much as it possibly could by means of standover tactics and in terms of penalties that can be enforced on business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accord has only masked Australia's real problems. The Labor Party's response to industrial relations in the 1980s has brought about low productivity and falling competitiveness while elevating union influence to encompass a huge range of issues. Union consultation became necessary if business wanted to do anything at all in the 1980s. History, another recession and one million unemployed have taught us that when the Labor Party deregulated the Australian economy it should have grasped the nettle and deregulated the labour market as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite Labor's manic support of the award system, or maybe because of it, Australians are turning away from trade unionism and the centralised system to a more independent industrial future. According to the ACTU's own magazine, 57 per cent of Australian workplaces have no union members at all. That figure rises to 66 per cent in the private sector. Only 44 per cent of private sector employees are members of a union. By contrast, 64 per cent of Australians would prefer their pay and conditions to be negotiated directly with the employers. That figure is from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 29 August 1992. Ninety per cent of Australians believe trade union membership should be voluntary. If membership was not compulsory in some workplaces, many trade unions would fold altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Australians know that the award system has failed them. Eleven per cent of Australians are out of work under the award system. Jobs are being lost faster than they are created. Real wages under the accord have slipped by two per cent. The gap between the rich and poor has widened considerably. In 1982-83 the income of the top one per cent of income earners equalled the total earnings of the bottom 11 per cent. By 1988-89, the top one per cent earned the equivalent of the total incomes of the bottom 21 per cent. In the last 20 years, working Australians have been going backwards. The low income households, those earning less than $22,000, have grown from 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the population. The top 30 per cent controls 55 per cent of household income. The bottom 30 per cent controls a mere 10 per cent. Where is the fairness?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past three decades Australian management has embraced change to improve its international competitiveness. Concepts like total quality management, participative management, new service techniques and world best practice have made a great impact on business without affecting workers' pay and conditions. Australian management is getting its act together, which is certainly about time, and there is more that can be done in this area. However, unions are keeping workers and employers apart at a time when there is much more to be gained by bringing them together. Despite apparent support for enterprise bargaining in the ALP, little has changed. A senior executive in the food industry said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the federal government and the ACTU from their vantage points paint a glowing picture of what is going on in relation to workplace reform, on the shop floor, where the real action is, nothing has really happened.</PARA>
<PARA>A survey of the Victorian members of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures in mid-1992 showed that 71 per cent believed enterprise bargaining should be the basis of industrial relations. However, their desire to get involved with enterprise bargaining was being frustrated by the inadequacies of the present system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industrial Relations and Management</EMPHASIS> identified three impediments to enterprise bargaining. Firstly, trade union officials are not committed to the concept, despite supposed ALP backing. According to the IRM, at least 12 major companies have had their agreements held up because of resistance from union officials. Even where the majority of workers supported the agreement, unions threw a spanner in the works. Secondly, minority unions refused to sign agreements struck with the majority of workers. The IRM reports that a group of only five to 10 maintenance workers have delayed agreements involving wage rises for hundreds of production workers for six to nine months. Thirdly, there is a lack of understanding of enterprise bargaining among the lower ranking union officials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the trade union movement, the award system is the holy grail. Unionists know their days are numbered and that union members would probably be better off in a far more flexible system in which they had greater control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth reflecting on what has happened in New Zealand, despite the enormous bagging it has got from time to time. In New Zealand, unions have participated in about half of all collective contract negotiations. Minimum standards have been maintained. Ninety per cent of the new work force agreements are enterprise based. Sixty-five per cent of the new agreements involve real wage increases. Only 5 per cent result in wage reductions, with the consent of employees. Ninety-five per cent of the contract provided for ordinary working hours of 40 hours per week, or 37 1/2 hours for salaried staff. Eighty-eight per cent of the agreements include additional service-related leave above and beyond the normal four weeks annual leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With benefits like this, it is no wonder the unions are panicking. At the end of February 1993, only 715 workplace agreements had been ratified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Workers and bosses want more flexibility, greater productivity, higher profits and more jobs. Standing between them and their goals are a bunch of unionists more interested in the past than the future. Australia cannot afford to wait much longer for labour market reform. The world is more competitive today than ever before and, unless the trade unions address themselves to marketplace reform, they will fail. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The award system, as we know it, has been of enormous benefit to working people in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to just explain some of the case histories that have occurred in the Geelong area under the deregulated system that is so lauded by honourable members opposite. The honourable member for La Trobe&mdash;and I work on the parliamentary committees with him&mdash;is an honourable gentleman and a very likeable gentleman. But I think he is caught up in his own ideological ether on this issue. He is asking for an industrial relations system which provides choice and he is calling for a total deregulation of the labour market. He is saying that we ought to move the industrial relations system from the 19th century into the 20th century and on to the 21st, via the conservative philosophy. If this is the example that those opposite are hanging their hats on, they ought to hang their heads in shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Geelong region prior to the Kennett legislation, employers and employees, and unions and employer organisations, really got on very well. The relationships were on an equal footing and employer organisations, along with the union movement, were attempting to change the culture of the workplaces in the Geelong area. The situation now, after the Kennett legislation has been introduced, and especially in the retail and hospitality industries, is that that good relationship has been poisoned and dramatically changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example. In a general purpose food store in Geelong management introduced a workplace contract, of the kind that those opposite are proposing, for two young workers. It was their first job. They were told to sign. Both asked to be able to take the contracts home to their parents and to talk the matter through. The parents of one of the young persons advised that elements of the contract were not up to an acceptable standard and contacted the Department of Labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contract contained three pages. It included one line on wages but it actually excluded the actual wage rate. This was to be filled in by the employer after the young person signed the contract. It included a clause that said:</PARA>

That is where the debate is at in this country. The Labor Party is hanging on to a 1904 system&mdash;almost 100 years old&mdash;and it wants to increase the bureaucratic mechanisms to keep union power.

How can it be claimed that the award system is equitable when there are a million unemployed&mdash;a million people who get no income from productive effort&mdash;and it is the system and the accord of those opposite that have largely been to blame? There is no fairness in this system. There are a million people unemployed and another million out there who would like to put their names down for jobs but who have become so phased out applying for jobs that they have given up. In effect, there are probably 1 1/2 to two million unemployed people in this country, and honourable members opposite come in here and say that the industrial award system&mdash;the employment mechanism we have in this country&mdash;is equitable.

It walked away fast because it did not want two salary scales developed within the teaching system that I was working in at that stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) something about intimidation. When the Lakes Creek meatworkers were holding a peaceful picket line, the people from Smorgon's rang up the local constabulary and said, `We are worried that the bus driver might get hurt', and so the local constabulary came out and intimidated peacefully protesting meatworkers. If we do not maintain award conditions then we will certainly have more industrial intimidation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the House to the wonderful jobsback which, we have to remind ourselves, is still apparently the opposition's industrial relations policy, although Senator Bishop is now saying that the opposition has dropped the $3 youth wage, but who are we to believe&mdash;the senator or the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that at the election the great sleeper in the campaign was the industrial relations policy of the opposition. The coalminers in the Bowen Basin certainly have very long memories. The particular memory that they keep on reminding me about is when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) poked his nose out the pub door and caused a riot by trying to tax their subsidised housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalminers of central Queensland are a very strong and effective unionised work force, and&mdash;surprise! surprise!&mdash;45 per cent of the coalmining work force is covered by enterprise agreements, indicating that it is very clear that a solid and disciplined union movement can move towards flexible work practices. That is part of their submission to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). I suggest to honourable members that the nonsense that is being perpetrated on the other side of the House is a shallow piece of intellectual rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to bring to the notice of the House this morning the importance of protecting working conditions for certain members of the work force. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) talks about individual rights. Let me suggest that in touting individual rights he is forgetting about the protection of large minority groups in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rosslyn Noonan, a New Zealand trade unionist, is reported as saying that economic theories that emphasise the right of the individual damage women, young people and ethnic minorities. She also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is ironical that the most serious challenge to equality from women has come not from those asserting the inferiority of women or an inherently different female role, but from those who claim to value the individual and the individual's freedom above all else.</PARA>
<PARA>Award provisions have helped to maintain a reasonable degree of parity for women in the work force. However, that has not been totally successful. I am pleased to see that there will be an attempt to address these issues in the new industrial relations provisions that will be introduced by the Minister for Industrial Relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us remind ourselves that 75 per cent of the part-time work force is female and 64 per cent of those women want to work more hours. We still have a very much gender segregated work force in this country, with 55 per cent of women in two occupational groups: clerical and sales. It is very important that those members of the work force with the least industrial muscle are protected by the award provisions. That is why women, young people and ethnic minorities supported the Labor government at the last election and, until honourable members opposite deal with those issues, that will continue to be the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interjections of the honourable member for O'Connor are absolutely irrelevant, like his party. Union power is still in place. Most people have maintained their union membership and the unions remain a party to negotiated settlements. Workers have not chosen alternative representatives as agents, as was suggested in the jobsback proposals. Penalty rates are still in place but wage rises are not being delivered to most workers. The evidence is that 50 per cent of the workers under new collective agreements have experienced either a wage cut or no wage increases. Most importantly, productivity is not rising due to the employment contracts act. Productivity has been improving since 1987, but there is little evidence to identify that productivity based pay systems are being used to improve production systems. Those opposite have a blinkered view on this. They have an absolute preoccupation with the idea that industrial relations is the key to productivity changes in this country. They are not prepared to look at the complex picture of the structural adjustments that are necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

As I have indicated, the coal industry is an excellent example of where a strong, unionised work force is able to be very efficient in this matter. It is very important that we maintain the award system. We obviously have to deal with the current industrial situation, and it is going to be more flexible, but, if we take away the safety net of those award conditions, we are going to find many workers in a very difficult situation. So I think it is very important that we support this. I am delighted that, after the negotiations between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Minister for Industrial Relations, we are likely to see introduced into this House a bill that will provide for that protection and flexibility upwards, not flexibility downwards.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could make a fiery speech and say, `Oh, isn't it terrible?', as the Labor Party is so good at doing. I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) at least is still here. I could talk about the dastardly deeds of unionists&mdash;the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) summed up the intimidation factor, which no Australian could ever support&mdash;but surely that is not what we are about as a parliament. As a parliament surely we have to be about the best interests of every Australian. When we have an adversarial system which the Labor Party draws its strength from by saying that it defends the victims and we on this side of the House are the oppressors, surely that is not getting the maximum out of our system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the people of Australia think, particularly the union members. In the private sector, 28 per cent of people are members of unions. There is no doubt that the very strong reason why 72 per cent of Australia's workers are not in the union movement is that they see the blockages, the intimidation and the weaknesses that the union movement sadly brings to our economic system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important at this point to dwell briefly on the international system and the competitive position of Australia. We are No. 18 in the OECD, when we were once No. 1. In the international league, Australia's GDP per head of population is $US17,300, which is similar to Great Britain's. Switzerland has the highest at about $US35,000. The real challenge for Australia is to see how we improve our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very interesting press headlines this morning about mental health, and our resources and capacity to handle these very sad cases. How do we do it? We have to have an economic system which actually has the capacity to deliver the economic wherewithal. Something that this country has never done&mdash;that this government has never done&mdash;is to look at how we are exporting jobs. Does the award system retain the most jobs in this country or does it export jobs? No-one has ever done any survey; there is no analysis. The great irony is that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) knows what has to happen. He said it in his April speech, but Kelty said no and that was that. So we are left with an award system that is the only one of its type left in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Referring to the second point of the motion, it may be true that non-unionists are helped by the actions of their unionist friends in winning conditions, but nobody talks about the unemployed, nobody talks about the minority groups, nobody talks about small business and, as I have just said, nobody talks about the export of jobs to other economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the Labor Party's so-called moral monopoly. It believes that it has the monopoly on defending the underprivileged. It believes that it has the right to represent true social justice in this country, and yet the Labor government presides over historically high unemployment and record bankruptcies. I take an example from my own occupation. Farmers have been pretty proud contributors to the Australian economy, and 20 or 30 years ago they earned about double the average wage. Now, if they are lucky, they earn about half of the average wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have productivity in agriculture of four to five per cent. Much was made by honourable members on the other side about the improvements in productivity, but the national productivity rate is lucky to be one per cent. The great irony is that that productivity from agriculture is forced by the award system because, as farmers strive to survive under the huge cost pressures imposed by the award system, they get four to five per cent productivity increases per annum. Of course, nobody wants to talk about the effect the award system has on land care and the pressure that people have to put on their land as they go into debt driven production. It is a huge weakness in this economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the situation in regional Australia. My electorate, as some would realise, involves the upper Spencer Gulf cities, where unemployment has historically been high at around 20 per cent. Some of those cities would register at 15 or 18 per cent, but the rate is mainly over 20 per cent. And what has the award system done for that rate? What is the award system doing for those people who have just been forced on to social welfare? What has the award system done for the dignity of human beings? Absolutely nothing! The strong and selfish dominate the weak and the helpless&mdash;under a Labor government, the champion of social justice! It is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hypocrisy is entirely beyond belief. We hear a lot from the other side of the House about the true representatives of the working people of Australia. We do not hear very much about the non-working people; we do not hear very much about the young who are without opportunities; and we certainly do not hear anything about those in small business. Is anybody here going to suggest that anyone in small business does not work? Is anybody going to suggest that anyone in the corporate sector does not work, and that they are not workers? This is a politically selective process. Honourable members opposite think they have some monopoly on this process. I say that they have no monopoly, and it is time they realised that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Audit (Auditor-General an Officer of the Parliament) Amendment Bill 1993 is to make the Auditor-General an officer of the parliament, thus independent of executive government. The Auditor-General and his office are fundamental to the maintenance of accountability of government officials and instrumentalities to the parliament and, through parliament, to the people. In the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and elsewhere, it is an accepted practice that there is a statutory relationship between the external auditor and the parliament for the provision of resources to the Auditor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill assures the independence of the Audit Office by making the Auditor-General an officer of the parliament. This legislation was moved concurrently in the Senate by Senator Watson, a longstanding former deputy chairman of the public accounts committee. In March 1989, that joint committee argued in report No. 296, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: ally of the people and parliament</EMPHASIS>, that a strong Audit Office was essential for the maintenance of accountability of federal government organisations and officials to parliament, and that the statutory relationship between the Auditor-General and the parliament, unchanged since Federation, now needed major revision to reflect both the evolution of government over that period as well as the evolution in the role of audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PAC asked whether the audit office had kept pace with public sector audit elsewhere in Australia and overseas and whether current arrangements guaranteed the independence and resources necessary for the Australian National Audit Office to fulfil its role as determined by the Act of 1901. The committee found that the audit office had, at best, major problems and, at worst, was in a state of crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major problem was resource constraints, demonstrated by the complaints of former auditors-general Monaghan and Brigden and the present Auditor-General, John Taylor. They have all complained about the effects of this on their independence. For example, according to audit office records, programs of income or expenditure greater than $10 million could be expected to have an efficiency audit only once every 40 years. This is intolerable and is inconsistent with a maximum effort to improve public sector efficiency. While resources must be available for financial and compliance auditing, efficiency auditing must not be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major weakness that was highlighted during the inquiry was that the Department of Finance was the principal adviser to executive government on the resources that should be allocated to the Australian National Audit Office. Consequently, the Auditor-General is not independent of executive government. The PAC identified five reasons underlying the ANAO's problems: parliamentary complacency; the fact that the office fell between the legislature and the executive, with the result that neither was willing to take responsibility for the condition of the office; the lack of a mechanism allowing parliament to assume responsibility for the office; a previous overemphasis on economy of operation by the audit office rather than on reappraisal of its contribution to effective and good government; and a lack of awareness of the importance of the audit to government activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solutions that the public accounts committee sought included: explicit reaffirmation of the necessity for the Auditor-General to be free of political control; a new audit act establishing the Auditor-General as an officer of the parliament and the audit office as a statutory authority; the granting to the Auditor-General of the authority to determine the terms and conditions of the employment of staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, the government has done nothing to implement these 1989 recommendations of the public accounts committee. Consequently, this private member's bill should be debated and passed by the House to support its own committee and the principle of the government being fully accountable to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office suffers from financial constraints and potential lack of independence from the government now more than ever before. At a Senate estimates committee on 2 September this year, the present Auditor-General, Mr Taylor, drew attention to the financial dilemma his office was facing as a result of the usurious Centenary House lease which was arranged for his office by the Labor Party. The lease was arranged by the Australian Property Group of DAAS to give the ALP a guaranteed compound annual rent increase of nine per cent over 15 years with no review. These terms are extraordinarily generous to the ALP, when there is no evidence in Canberra of leases for amounts in excess of one or two per cent per year in a normal rental market&mdash;certainly not nine per cent. The finance department has approved only a one per cent annual increase and says that the audit office is up for the difference between one per cent and nine per cent, representing some $34 million over the length of the lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General believes that this will cripple the audit office's ability to perform its proper role. The office will have to vacate Centenary House by the year 1996, as it will be unable to afford the lease. The Attorney-General's has advised that, if the ALP does not agree to dissolve the agreement, the ALP would sue the Commonwealth for damages and probably win. The current Auditor-General has said that the situation is absolutely disastrous and that the audit office will be unable to audit properly beyond 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also clear that, if the Auditor-General is more answerable to and resourced by the parliament rather than the executive, such an outrageous situation would not occur. He has the right to demand the protection of this parliament in the performance of his statutory duties. It is a disgrace that the federal government is bankrolling its bankrupt party in this manner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to be speaking this morning in support of the motion of my colleague the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans). The motion is seeking, generally, increased funding and support in respect of breast cancer. It is a pleasure to see a new member of the federal parliament, the honourable member for Cowan from Western Australia, making a substantial contribution in his first year in the parliament towards issues such as health, and especially women's health. I am also pleased to note that honourable members on both sides of the House so far in this debate, and I am quite sure in the remaining parts of this debate, have endeavoured to support the general principles of the initiative of the honourable member for Cowan&mdash;and so it should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel very strongly about the need for Australia to put a greater commitment into tackling the dreadful problem surrounding breast cancer, which mainly occurs in women&mdash;although it does occur in males as well. I have a personal interest in the issue as I lost a close member of my family not too long ago as a result of breast cancer. The problem with breast cancer is that not enough is known about it. It has, unfortunately, resulted in the death of more and more Australian women each year. In fact, this year I think it is expected, regrettably, that some 2,700 women will die. The honourable member for Cowan mentioned that six women per day die in Australia as a result of breast cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what I know of the disease, it is one of those cancers which is largely preventable, just as is male cancer of the bowel&mdash;which my friends in the medical world tell me is the most preventable cancer, provided early diagnosis occurs. The system and techniques of early diagnosis are available in Australia. But how to persuade Australian males, particularly males over the age of 40, to avail themselves of these tests is the problem&mdash;as is the case with respect to breast cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell the House, as a member representing country areas&mdash;in my case, north-east Victoria&mdash;that there are just no mammography screening services available at all for women in my electorate. The only available services in Albury-Wodonga and Wangaratta are in the private sector. Unfortunately, Medicare rebates, believe it or not, are not available there unless the person seeking the mammography test, at the private clinic, is able to establish that there is a need for it because of perhaps a previous family history&mdash;in which case Medicare rebates are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is such an anomaly when you consider that pap smears are available, and so they should be, under Medicare. In the case of eye tests&mdash;for example, for people seeking driver's licences&mdash;Medicare rebates are available. But they are not available for pure screening purposes for Australian women, except in the screening facilities that are being established, gradually, across Australia under a national state program&mdash;which I fully support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tyranny of distance and isolation for rural women is a real problem. I do not feel comfortable with the thought that there are women in my electorate, in north-east Victoria, who may find that a problem with breast cancer could be detected and their lives actually saved had they been given the opportunity for tests. But how do you take a woman from Wangaratta, with a family and limited means, to Canberra where the nearest mammography screening facilities are available? Canberra in relation to Wangaratta&mdash;just think of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national campaign for mammography screening is being supervised very ably by the national cancer councils of the various states. It was very good to see recently the New South Wales State Cancer Council&mdash;which is the same organisation as the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria, so why their names are different, I do not know&mdash;at a public meeting organised by the Albury-Wodonga Soroptimists, which is a women's organisation, agree in principle to the establishment of mammography screening facilities in Albury-Wodonga. I am presently working with the Victorian side to see whether we can get that screening service established on a joint state basis, as it should be, to serve the catchments on both sides of the border and hopefully one day include the provision of testing facilities as well as assessment facilities. The nearest assessment facilities in my part of the world will be in Wagga, which is a long way away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Cowan pointed out the paucity of funding for breast cancer research in Australia. In round figures, only about $30 million&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;is spent on research, but, to be fair, an additional $60-odd million is being spent in respect of mammography and that will grow each year as mammography expands. When one considers the dramatic effect of the disease, the fact that it is preventable if diagnosed early, and the problems that families experience when a loved one contracts the disease, I do not believe that those factors should be ignored. I consider that governments across Australia have not done enough in respect of supporting research to find a cure and better means of treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an excellent suggestion by the honourable member for Cowan that we could help governments with scarce resources to find more money by offering additional taxation benefits to people who wish to make donations and gifts to research funds. It is a very innovative idea for difficult times. The honourable member suggested 150 per cent deductibility could be allowed to people for donations to the anti-cancer councils of Australia to expand research into breast cancer. That is an easy initiative, and if someone brought in a bill today I think I could muster up enough support from both sides of the House to pass an amendment to the Income Tax Act. The honourable member for Cowan is to be commended for that suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to thank a few people in my part of Australia who have been helping me with the campaign to draw attention to this situation and to do practical things to get more facilities for women. I have mentioned the Albury-Wodonga soroptimists, Helen Cameron, Pat Gould and Dr Heather Bartram, who have helped so much in their area. I also mention a club in Wangaratta called the Zonta Club, and honourable members may be aware of Zonta and its good work. Its members have been helping me to muster up petitions which will be presented to parliament fairly soon. I particularly acknowledge Isobel Dunstan and Elspeth Connor of the Zonta Club in Wangaratta for their work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention that there are a lot of other problems in health in Australia. As a former assistant minister for health and shadow minister for health in Victoria, I am prepared to acknowledge that it is the responsibility of us all, not just one party or another. The report by Burdekin in respect of mental health has highlighted again an area of concern and I emphasise that, as with breast cancer research, it is an issue that we all should be addressing more vigorously in the parliament. I for one have been trying to point out for years, both as a state member and a federal member, that we have got different laws in Australia on mental health and that for 30 years a working party comprising New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia has been trying to come up with uniformity of state laws on mental health. That is disgraceful. It is no wonder that issues regarding health, such as more facilities and research, are being retarded when we are stymied at the pass on fundamental issues such as uniformity in the treatment of mental health problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable members opposite for their comments and I certainly agree with them in the main. It also pleases me greatly that the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) is concerned about women's health. It is very warming to note that the opposite gender is concerned in our areas. The issue of cancer, breast cancer in particular, is one which needs constant focus. All women should and must be aware of the high incidence of this disease. Although the honourable member for Cowan does have a good suggestion on the tax incentive for donations to research, he approaches this problem from a slightly wrong perspective. It must be remembered that more money is spent on screening for breast cancer than is spent on screening for any other disease in Australia. Sixty-four million dollars will be spent on this program alone over the next three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Cowan is critical of this program because of its unavailability to women younger than 40 years of age. I must stress that the structure of this program is based solely upon medical evidence and medical research. It is aimed at women most at risk. Women aged over 40, but especially those between the ages of 50 and 69, may have access to breast cancer screening at any time. Women aged under 40 with a family history of breast cancer, or an indication of breast disease, may have access to a diagnostic mammogram, rebatable on Medicare, upon referral from their GP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the comment of the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) on the availability of such screening and advise him that there are many advisory services available to smaller communities, specifically through community health programs, on self-screening processes, which services are very effective. The structure of the program itself reflects the medical evidence. It seems that breast cancer may have hereditary links, and these people are covered. The incidence of breast cancer in people over the age of 50 is much greater than in people under the age of 40, and these people are well and truly covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program is structured so that the funds are targeted to the areas of greatest need, and this is as it must be. It is true that more money could be spent in this area, but more money could be spent in most health care areas. The fact remains that, at a time when health care funding is finite and all programs are competing for funding, the money that is spent on breast cancer is some of our best spent and best targeted health care dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment made by the honourable member for Cowan that mammography can be demeaning and painful for the woman being tested is nothing short of irresponsible. In my opinion, it insults the dedicated health care workers who deal with breast cancer screening on a daily basis. The technical competence and expertise of those involved in our screening process are incredibly high. Their competence and expertise build upon experiences worldwide and are internationally renowned. I personally apologise to those health care workers on behalf of the honourable member of Cowan for the insinuation that they are less than caring in the discharge of their duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a member of this parliament to make such a statement is inexcusable. We must encourage Australian women to take part in this screening program, not scare them so that they are too frightened to come forward. I have personally had a mammogram and, because most women in this parliament&mdash;most women&mdash;are in the age group most at risk, I sincerely hope my parliamentary colleagues have also had a mammogram. I did, indeed, experience a slight level of discomfort, but in no way did I feel demeaned by the process, and no woman should. It is far better to experience a small level of discomfort under this quality procedure than to live with the spectre of breast cancer. Nothing that saves lives or the breasts of Australian mothers, daughters, sisters and aunts can be demeaning or humiliating. It would be very sad if the comments made by the honourable member for Cowan in this parliament frightened one woman away from a mammogram. I would not want that on my conscience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsibility of this parliament is to give Australian citizens confidence in their excellent health system. Health care is a very personal thing. Everyone has responsibility for her own health. As parliamentarians, we have a duty to encourage the fullest involvement of Australian citizens in the health care programs we institute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not valid to compare breast cancer and HIV-AIDS funding on a death to dollar ratio. The only similarity between these two forms of diseases is that this government is funding leading edge research into both. AIDS and breast cancer are simply not comparable. At the moment, we can only hope to stem the spread of AIDS by prevention. Comparatively little is known about the basic cause of AIDS. AIDS is communicable. Conversely, breast cancer is not communicable and real results in defeating the disease can be achieved after detection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some $4.5 million of AIDS research funding is to be spent on virological and immunological research. This research is relevant to work done on other diseases. The spending of this money provides valuable information on steps towards a cure for a number of diseases, not just AIDS. Breast cancer research and HIV-AIDS research are simply not comparable. They are two totally different concerns which deserve totally different treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as instituting the national breast cancer screening program, this government is committed to funding quality breast cancer research. In 1993, approximately $13.5 million is being provided in support of cancer related research. That is to be commended. Twelve research projects which specifically deal with breast cancer are being funded. A further $2.1 million is being paid to the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney. This institute is recognised as being world class in its breast cancer research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must also be remembered that Australian health ministers have identified cancer as being one of the four priority areas of the revised national health goals and targets. Particular attention in this process is being placed on breast cancer. In the total context of women's health, it is this government that actually conducted consultations with the women of Australia in 1987 and 1988 in regard to what concerned women about health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This led to the formulation of the national women's health policy, of which breast cancer is one of the concerns in the total context of women's health. It is one of the concerns that receive high priority from this government, but it is funded within the total framework of women's health. This track record and these initiatives highlight the level of priority the government places on fighting this disease. I am very pleased to say that, under the breast cancer screening program, a screening unit opened in Launceston, in my own electorate of Bass, in July of this year. No program, however, is perfect. We can do more and we need to know more, especially in relation to treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is being addressed by the National Health and Medical Research Council's Quality of Care Committee, which is developing best practice guidelines for breast cancer treatment. We must always remember, though, that it was this government that instituted a comprehensive screening program for breast cancer, a program that is better funded than any other disease screening program. I urge all the women of Australia to use it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I very much welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the motion on breast cancer research put to this House a fortnight ago by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans). In May this year the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health (Mr Howe) a series of questions relating to breast cancer. The latest available figures on the number of Australian women diagnosed with breast cancer are from 1985. They totalled 5,837 women, an increase from 1982 of 15.65 per cent. The latest information issued by the pathology department of the University of Western Australia estimates the figure currently at 7,000 women per annum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To highlight the immense importance of this issue to the nation, I draw the attention of honourable members in the House today to this breast prosthesis. I do so because this prosthesis is used by many women who are diagnosed and who have undergone what is commonly known as the slash, burn and poison regime. I think it is very important that we truly come to grips with this problem in our nation. It goes beyond the current regime of treatment; it moves into the realm of research. Too often this regime involves the removal of one or more breasts. It is bad enough that so many Australian women must suffer this mutilation of their bodies, requiring the use of such devices as the one that I have brought to the House today, but it is the loss of life that touches all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My grave concern is for the 2,500 women who lose their lives each year in Australia from this disease. Every three hours, as we go about the business of this place, one Australian woman dies from breast cancer. It may be your mother, sister, cousin, aunt, grandmother, wife or the mother of your children. The Hancock Family Breast Cancer Foundation has estimated that one in every 10 Australian women is likely to contract breast cancer. The foundation's report says that, while the incidence is rising, due in part to better detection, the mortality rate is also increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are not many families untouched by this devastating disease. Women are our primary caregivers and the loss of so many women is felt acutely in the homes around the nation. Women have been told they must learn to cope, and cope they have. Women, in their usual stoic way, come to terms with this awful disfigurement and the immediate risk of death, should detection come too late or a treatment fail. May I suggest that the time for coping is well past. It is now time to find a cure. The appalling facts are that, according to the latest census figures, there are 6,653,744 women over the age of 15 in Australia. Allocated funding for breast cancer research specifically amounts to $900,000 per annum. Simplified, that equates to approximately 10c per woman per annum. That is the pitiful amount spent on breast cancer research in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is clear that progress has been made in the areas of detection and treatment, these measures do not address frequency of occurrence. There is a pressing need to step up the effort towards establishing cause and prevention. It is sad but true that the daughters of women who died from breast cancer a decade ago are getting the same chemotherapy and the same radiation as their mothers before them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The temptation to take the quick fix route always beckons. In the case of breast cancer, it is easier to treat the condition than to work out why it occurs. There is too great a reliance on surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. There is no justification for continuing to excuse the situation away. Even a minor reduction to one in 12 women diagnosed would save this country millions of dollars in medical costs and lost opportunity, not to mention the alleviation of considerable pain and suffering by the countless women afflicted and their grieving families. A press release issued by the University of Western Australia Pathology Department stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the incidence and mortality rates associated with breast cancer, the national attitude to it is less than to other diseases which cause less suffering and affect a smaller proportion of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost to society and to the family of the 2,000 Australian women dying each year from breast cancer cannot be estimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs of the morbidity caused by breast cancer treatment in the 5,000 survivors, on society, business and the family structure is equally enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Breast cancer more than any other disease strikes at the very fabric of the individual&mdash;the woman's sexuality, motherhood, and affects the whole dynamic of the family. It also robs the work force of valuable members, and can disrupt the whole tenor of existence of a young family from which the mother has been removed either by death, disability, or morbidity.</PARA>
<PARA>With a large proportion of Australian women reaching the high-risk age group within the next decade, the nation must assign a higher priority to stepping up the research program. Apart from not assigning sufficient funding to research, we have been slow to learn from experiences overseas. It is now established with empirical evidence that high quality mammography can dramatically reduce the risk of death from breast cancer for those women who undergo the procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I return to the issue of adequate funding for research into breast cancer. To further drive home the message, I quote from an article by Susan Ferraro, published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS> magazine on 15 August this year, entitled, `"You Can't Look Away Anymore": The Anguished Politics of Breast Cancer'. It says, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Especially riveting is Sherry Kohlenberg of Virginia. The mother of a four-year-old boy, Kohlenberg, 37, is a small figure in black&mdash;pale but fierce. Her straw hat wobbles on her head because chemotherapy has made her hair fall out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"This year, 46,000 women will die of breast cancer", she [Kohlenberg] says. "I will probably be among these statistics. I will leave behind my husband and partner of 18 years, a motherless child, a devastated family and too many friends. I will not get to watch my son grow up, or grow old with my husband. And the worst part is that I am not alone. This family tragedy happens every time a new diagnosis is made, and every time a woman's life is stolen by breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a familiar but chilling story. In the same article, Dr Susan M. Love, Director of UCLA Breast Centre, says that `early detection is not <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">early</EMPHASIS> enough'. She asserts that there is a notion, all too prevalent, that `if you do your breast self-exam and you get your mammogram, your cancer will be found early and you'll be cured and life will be groovy'. Certainly, women should continue to take all available steps toward early detection, but that should not deter an adequately funded research program that will work toward prevention of the disease in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a country whose Prime Minister boasts international best practice in myriad policies, it is curious that Australia spends only 1.4 per cent of revenue on medical research when the international best practice is a minimum of 2 per cent. Perhaps it is not a politically correct barrow to push. Maybe it is not glamorous enough. If the response from the two government members last fortnight is any indication it seems that, when it comes to human life, second best will do for this government. Surely the health of this nation and of women, in this instance, should have a priority and should be afforded best international practice, at least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Socially, the cost involves pain, suffering, loss, and grief for families. Even if this government were to take a dispassionate view, it is difficult to argue with the fact that women are taking an increasing role as main or supplementary breadwinners and as primary caregivers. The economic cost to the nation is high. The front page of Tuesday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> reported the Prime Minister acknowledging the importance of women's affairs by pledging to elevate the portfolio to cabinet status. His pledge came after a report on his women's policy advisory unit, the Office of the Status of Women, found the unit was `not focused in its efforts and not clear about what its core business was'. The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The range of tasks undertaken and issues covered by the Office of the Status of Women has led to a fragmentation of its work . . . The result is lowered efficiency and a mismatch between priorities and resources.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate. I want to congratulate the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans), for bringing this debate into the House, and all the other speakers who have spoken on this topic. I feel sure that on this matter we can have a truly bipartisan approach. It is important because, as the honourable member for Pearce (Ms Moylan) has quite correctly indicated, the issue and the cost to the Australian community are significant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is not just necessary to take a dispassionate view on the economic argument. I think we all share the compassionate argument because we are talking about a devastating epidemic, with women dying 20 years earlier than when they might expect to die. It is an absolutely urgent national health issue that this government has committed resources to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Pearce quite correctly indicated that $900,000 has been allocated to 12 research projects that are specifically related to breast cancer, but it is also important to highlight the allocations to other funding organisations, including the block grants to major research institutes. It is estimated that 20 per cent of the $2.1 million that goes to the Garvan Institute in Sydney is spent on breast cancer research; $2.4 million is allocated by the Australian cancer societies to breast cancer research; and the National Health and Medical Research Council spends about 20 per cent of its $110 million budget on cancer and immunological research which will include breast cancer. So, although it is difficult to get a definitive amount together on this, there is certainly a fair bit of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to argue about the fact that there should be more. We are talking about a cancer which is responsible for more deaths in women than any other cancer and one which, to a large extent, can be prevented if detection is early enough. It is fairly clear in talking with my colleague Jennifer Muller, who is the coordinator of the Women's Cancer Prevention Program in the Women's Health Policy Unit in Queensland and formerly worked in an epidemiology unit in that state, that there has not been a great deal of change in the success rate of actual treatments vis-a-vis mortality rates in the last 50 years. While research is important&mdash;and lifestyle issues may affect the incidence of this disease&mdash;there is no doubt that it is the screening and early detection that is going to make the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) and the honourable member for Pearce have said, we have all been touched by the effects of breast cancer in women&mdash;many of us having seen a friend or a loved one die. At the end of the day it is not the immediate treatment of the primary carcinoma, whether that be the trauma of mastectomy&mdash;and there are plenty of women who have recovered from that, coped well with it and now participate in their careers in a most effective way&mdash;but the tragedy of seeing the development of secondary carcinoma and the years of treatment, the debility, the morbidity and, ultimately, the mortality of women who often have quite young children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a disease of older women, although obviously the incidence does rise. When I consider this as an issue in my life I think of the early death of my friend Helen Kirkman from our mining town. With a total population of only 3,000, we have had several women who have had breast cancer. Helen was one of the unusual cases of younger women who contracted the disease in her early thirties when she still had a toddler, the fourth of her children. The next and last seven years of her life were an absolute disaster as she struggled as a woman in a relatively isolated community to obtain the treatment she needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that women in isolated areas have much greater difficulty in accessing services and treatment than women who are in capital cities. If ever any individual experience stays with me, it is the course of events that happened to Helen and the death and the loss of a mother to her young children. It was, in fact, a problem of lack of early detection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go on to the screening issues. One of the issues that we have to address as a community and that women have to address is the importance of taking responsibility for matters of their own bodies and not waiting for another person or a medical practitioner to tell them, `Yes, you should have a mammogram'. One of the important issues for Commonwealth and state governments&mdash;and I will be giving accolades to the Queensland state Labor government on these issues&mdash;is the importance of making sure, through media, that women take up this issue and actively go and request information and screening procedures, because what we are dealing with is a complex psychological problem for women in the community. The breast, as, I am sure, all my colleagues would accept, is one of the pre-eminent sexual icons of our culture, so much so that breastfeeding organisations such as the Nursing Mothers Association have to deal with the ambivalence in our culture about the breast as a symbolic object, a sexual object, as opposed to its natural function of providing the best nourishment there is for our newborn babies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those issues, I believe, contribute to the denial that occurs when women are faced with having to deal with the possibility that they may need a medical assessment; and it is that issue that not just women but the whole community must take up. There is no doubt that the cervical cancer screening promotion has had a big impact on assisting women to make use of cervical screening techniques, which, as we know, are the most effective way of dealing with that preventable form of cancer. I believe we have to allocate funding to this as an issue because the sexual icon of our culture is also one of the important causes of early and, in many cases, preventable death in the female population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reference to screening as one of the most effective and, indeed, the most cost efficient treatments, I think it is important to point out that we have put in a considerable amount of funding at the Commonwealth level, matching the states on a 50 per cent basis. Queensland, with the advent of the state Labor government, has demonstrated that, with a particular will at a state government level, much can be achieved. From talking to my consultant in the Queensland epidemiology unit, I learnt that Queensland has screened more women than any other state in Australia; and that takes into account that we have fewer women than other states. We have now got seven fixed screening units and three mobile units. Mobile units are going to be very important in decentralised states like Queensland, and I am pleased to be able to say that in the Capricornia electorate we will be formally opening the Rockhampton mammography unit in the next couple of weeks and that there will be a mobile screening unit available by May of next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very important because there is no doubt that rural and isolated women very often put their own health needs last, behind other economic issues and family issues; and so it is much harder to get women to put aside the time and the money to make the trek, say, from out west, whether it be the Bowen Basin or as far as Longreach, to come into Rockhampton. So it is very important to take this essential service out to women where they are; and that has been a commitment of the state Labor government. I should also pay tribute to the St Andrews Hospital in Rockhampton&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>I believe the intent of the motion at least is supported by all Australians and the vast majority of politicians. The senior reader in politics at Flinders University in Adelaide, Dean Jaensch, said only two weeks after the last election that Australia was now at a stage where truth in political advertising was absolutely necessary. He said that if anything came from the five-week election campaign, it was the need for some section of the electoral act to apply consumer protection laws on truth in advertising to political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the technical difficulties in inserting such sections in the act. More than that, I appreciate the practical difficulties, which are very real indeed and which many commentators would say make it impossible. But it comes as no surprise that, if anybody is against it, it is the politicians, and in some cases the politicians that are against it have been making a living out of fudging the truth. But, to summarise, if the will is there to do it, it can and will be done; if the will is not there, it will not be done. There is one excellent role model and precedent for this, and that is the Trade Practices Act. On page 67, part V, Consumer protection, division 1, Unfair practices, it says in section 52(1):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very simple sentence indeed. If we turn the page, section 53 goes on in more detail on how one must not falsely represent goods or services that are offered for sale. In less than a page, in a 250-page act, we have something that works. It has been possible to police this for hundreds of thousands of companies and hundreds of thousands of products with all their complexities, diversities, obscure locations et cetera, for 365 days of the year. If we can do it for that, it seems to me that we can surely do it for political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if people disagree that what I am proposing is possible, I think it is interesting to contemplate what effect it would have and what life would be like if we as politicians, for the first time in our lives, were to be accountable in a legal sense for everything we say. Is that such a frightening prospect? Is that asking too much? I think we would all have to be more considered, at least during election campaigns, in what we say. We would have to be more careful and thoughtful. It would be a sobering experience, and indeed for some a unique experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that this does not put us in a straitjacket, it would not limit us in any way in any pronouncement that we make, provided that we tell the truth. It would not constrain us in delivery or restrict us in content, provided that we adhere to the basic tenets of honesty. It would mean operating in foreign and uncharted waters for some, but it would be a first step for us all to start to regain some credibility in the public's eyes. I believe credibility for all of us as politicians is dangerously low. We are approaching a point where it will be almost irretrievable. Some of the public are so contemptuous and so cynical of us that they believe nothing that we say anymore. Before honourable members reject this proposition, I ask them to consider whether this is the way that they want to continue, whether this is the path that, when they are retired and have a grandchild sitting on their knee, they want to say that they trod. If it is not, I would be interested to hear of their suggestions to improve, if not to eliminate, the appalling practices that we have drifted into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we continue the way we are, ultimately we will be diminished and democracy itself&mdash;and some would argue that that is probably the most valuable asset this country has&mdash;will be unnecessarily tested by the privileged practitioners who sit in this place and who are entrusted by the Australian people to uphold, if not to enhance, democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to acknowledge two things. Every party has complained about the accuracy of the victor party's advertising in the past. Despite what any party says, all parties have transgressed in this area to one degree or another at every election. To put it in generous terms, everybody on some occasion has expanded the truth, been extravagant with the facts, glossed over the bad and difficult, and violated promises when confronted with the reality of office. I will go even further and say that that has sometimes been good for Australia. </PARA>

Broadly speaking, we have all accepted unwritten guidelines. The members of the public, albeit cynically, have probably extended a certain tolerance.

Honourable members opposite may interject, but the central theme of their election campaign was that they would cut taxes without introducing any new taxes. Their theme was tax cuts without the GST. Some even said that we would be putting 15 per cent extra on petrol. I suppose in a sense that was true, but it was true only if they ignored the fact that we were knocking 19c to 26c off the cost.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the honourable member for Parkes for having the gall to stand up here and say that he is concerned about the Commonwealth Electoral Act and its ability to deal with misleading and untruthful advertising. It was this government that amended the act to include a section stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person must not, during the relevant period in relation to an election under this Act, authorise to be printed, published or distributed, any electoral matter containing a statement:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) that is untrue, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) that is, or is likely to be misleading or deceptive.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the law, l-a-w. The Commonwealth Electoral (Printing, Publishing and Distribution of Electoral Matters) Amendment Act 1990 is specific in its prohibition of false and misleading advertising and statements by candidates in the context of an election campaign. We all know the difference between the letter and the spirit of the law. The honourable member for Parkes and the rest of the coalition demonstrated that in the last election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own election campaign, however, it was a small number of hardworking officers of the Australian Electoral Commission who were the victims of a slur campaign based on false and misleading statements by the honourable member's Liberal colleagues. My electorate takes in the remote communities of Cape York Peninsula and the Torres Strait. In these small communities, everybody knows everyone else. Many people are related and have family ties and associations going back generations. In the recent campaign, a Liberal senator for Queensland, well known in the north for his grandstanding, called into question the conduct of the polling in the division of Leichhardt. A lot of noise was made at the close of polling&mdash;I suspect this had a lot to do with the future Liberal preselection for Leichhardt and not much to do with anything else&mdash;and a complaint was made to the Australian Electoral Commission. While a thorough investigation by the commission revealed no wrongdoing, the media interest beaten up by the senator devastated these tiny communities and potentially sullied the standing of AEC workers in them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the honourable member opposite to find out from his coalition friends why these people have not received an official apology. But I do not think we will get one from the honourable member for Parkes because I have been told that he made a public statement during the election campaign, when he was behind, that the AEC workers did not know what they were doing. He does not say that now, of course, because he won. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member cast aspersions on the AEC, and so did the Liberal Party in Leichhardt. Why should these people continue to bear the brunt of the coalition's misleading and untruthful statements that were so blatantly evident during the March 1993 election campaign? One AEC officer's report to the Australian Electoral Officer for Queensland, who conducted the inquiry, is worth reading. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally I would like to say that there are at least ten community members, including administrators, council members and local people, who strongly object to these allegations.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the allegations by the Liberal Party. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The voting public are very concerned about the negative publicity arising from the accusations and I think would be justified in requesting a public apology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, I would like to ask for an apology to be made to "d" who diligently fulfilled her task with the utmost professionalism, and, without her help the AEC would have had an extremely difficult job of running a polling booth. As entered in my general return on staff, she is an excellent asset to the commission.</PARA>
<PARA>I have documents obtained through a freedom of information inquiry that throws some light on these allegations. On reading these documents, one cannot help but notice some ugly tones of racism. I do not often use that term in this place, but racism it is, as well as being evidence of the paternalism that the party of the honourable member for Parkes holds so dear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the honourable member for Parkes, and I call on other coalition members who purport to support this motion, to put pressure on their colleagues in Far North Queensland and to put pressure on the particular senator to apologise to the people in those remote communities. That has not happened and that is a disgrace. It is simply sour grapes. It is simply because people, in both the National and Liberal parties, poured a lot of money into their campaigns in Leichhardt and they lost. They had to find some excuse, so they blamed people in remote communities in Far North Queensland. That is the hypocrisy of this sort of motion.

This debate is not an exercise in sour grapes or a stunt. I expect a few veterans opposite muttered away in the corridors about political advertising after the Liberal Party's capital gains tax efforts in 1980. But it is a simple matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last election campaign, the voters of Sturt were spared most of the apocryphal guff distributed by the ALP and its wealthy union mates in many seats, because Labor ran a relatively clean campaign in my electorate. One candidate, however, was fundamentally deceitful. As the sitting Liberal member for Sturt was retiring, a Mr Michael Pratt decided to run as a Liberal Independent, equipped with policies that read like a Readers Digest version of Fightback. His how-to-vote card read, `How to vote true-blue Liberal'. It contained instructions for voting Liberal in the Senate and added, `A vote for Michael Pratt is a vote for John Hewson'. Other pieces of literature followed this pattern while proclaiming Pratt's honesty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cases under section 52 of the Trade Practices Act dealing with conduct `likely to mislead or deceive' consider matters by reference to the members of the public who are likely to receive the material. As the judgment in Taco v. Taco Bell states, this includes `the astute and the gullible, the intelligent and the not so intelligent, the well educated and the poorly educated'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Pratt's literature was clearly dishonest. The word `true-blue' did not distinguish him from the endorsed Liberal candidate. The suggestion that `a vote for Michael Pratt is a vote for John Hewson' was misleading, and the inclusion of a Liberal Senate how-to-vote card deceptively suggested a connection between Pratt and the endorsed Liberal ticket. On most of his literature there was no suggestion at all that Pratt was an Independent candidate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pratt's actual election day efforts were even more egregious. He displayed posters from his unsuccessful 1990 campaign as a Liberal for the seat of Adelaide, with visible party logos and authorisation by the Liberal Party state director, until Electoral Commission staff ordered that he cover them up. Despite his antics, Pratt has suffered no legal sanction. Liberal strategists are now wondering what damage he may do if he runs in either of the marginal seats of Unley or Norwood in the state election and repeats his performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sections of the Electoral Act that have been interpreted as applying only to polling day itself should be extended to cover the duration of the election campaign. The Electoral Commission's power to enforce sanctions for misleading and deceptive advertising should be extended so that the power can be interpreted widely instead of narrowly as at present, and perhaps then cases such as those that occurred in Sturt will not be repeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Misleading and untruthful advertising serves no-one. It lowers the standing of this parliament. If we impose standards on certain sections of the community for their behaviour, we must be able to meet them ourselves. The Electoral Act should be amended to ensure truth in advertising for political purposes is brought more into line with commercial and business advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Democrat Senator Michael Macklin, with his party's usual quixotic enthusiasm, attempted such a change in a series of amendments to a bill under debate on the second last sitting day before the 1990 election.

If it is to be the body that initiates action under such proposals it will be important to put safeguards in place to ensure its neutrality is not compromised.

But in anything we say or do outside of this chamber, we are subject to the same laws as every other person in this country. So it is quite untrue to say that members of parliament have one set of laws for themselves and another set of laws for the rest of the country. That is not the case; we are subject to the same laws as every other person in this country.

As has already been indicated by my colleague the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), within this chamber, within this parliament, there is a process for dealing with considerations of amendments that might be required to the Australian Electoral Act. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) is going to talk about the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters, of which he is a member, because that is the appropriate forum within this parliament for raising concerns about the efficiency of the Australian Electoral Act and whether or not we need to make some amendments. In fact, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) is a member of that committee, has the opportunity to raise these issues in that committee and has not yet done so, as far as I am aware. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that what we have got here is a process of the coalition parties, because they lost the election, trying to look for someone to blame. They are going to shoot the messenger, and the messenger in this case is the Australian Electoral Commission, the independent body that supervises the electoral process in this country. They are not prepared to accept that the 1993 election, like the previous elections for the last 20 or 30 years, was subject to vigorous debate in the community and that there were lots of public discussion and debate and lots of heavy use of political advertising to put forward our views. The fact is that the people of Australia made their judgment that the Labor Party was the more credible party and that what we were saying in that election campaign was an accurate reflection of what would occur in government; and they accepted our version of what was going to occur rather than the coalition's. We now have the process where the coalition members are seeking to blame the Electoral Commission for their own failures and their own weaknesses in this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to talk about the way in which false advertising has occurred, I can say that I was a victim, just as the honourable member for Sturt was. But I used the legal processes that are available to me within the act to take action on that. The campaign director for the Liberal candidate in my electorate was found to have been responsible for the distribution throughout my electorate of an unauthorised and unsigned letter making an enormous range of false allegations about me and about the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we found out about this we immediately contacted the Australian Electoral Commission, which ordered that distribution of the document cease and conducted an inquiry into it; and the matter has been taken up with the AEC. The campaign director for the Liberal Party campaign in Moreton, Alderman Graham McDougall, has in fact admitted that he was responsible for that. So I was able to use the legal opportunities that are available under the Electoral Act to put a stop to someone distributing material which was clearly illegal and untruthful. There are avenues available under the act for members to take action. The fact is that, throughout the campaign, very vigorous debate was occurring.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I support this motion. I believe that what we have already heard in this debate gives an indication that there is a need to tighten up a lot of the regulations and laws that we have. For instance, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) has been accused of saying in this debate certain things which have been categorically denied. We have to get a starting place. If we want a reason for this motion, all we have to do is look at the attitude the public has. The honourable member for Parkes said that a tolerance has been given to politicians over the years about the manner in which their campaigns are conducted. I must say that I find that that tolerance has expired, that we have exhausted that tolerance, and that the public opinion of politicians at this stage should make us all realise that something should have been done. When we go back to the broken promises and the deceptions from both sides of politics in the campaign leading up to the elections of 13 March, surely we must realise that something is wrong with the system and something should be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are asserting in this motion that there is a need for truth in political advertising, just as there is a need for truth in commercial advertising. What we are suggesting is that the Trade Practices Act take a lot tougher stance, and so too the courts of this country, on misleading commercial advertising than they do on political material. In the most recent case that has been before the courts, in which Alasdair Webster was the petitioner, Justice Gaudron found that no offence in terms of the act had been committed, yet there were obviously offences committed as far as Alasdair Webster was concerned. What Justice Gaudron is saying is that it is not within her competence to give a judgment; the law does not effectively cover the points that were raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each member of parliament can see, in the complaints that have been laid by Alasdair Webster, echoes of things that have happened in our own electorates. I will give an example from my own electorate. There were press releases saying that the Bureau of Meteorology was going to close down, that the university was going to be removed and that prices were going to rise by 15 per cent on everything. All these assertions were made. My friend and colleague the honourable member for Parkes has talked about the involvement of the Seamen's Union, in actually distributing material that was out of date, out of time and quite inappropriate, but that matter was allowed to go past. These are the sorts of things we can all complain about. Surely what we should be addressing is the effect on the political process and on the people of Australia, and how we correct it. What we are saying with this motion is that there are means, if we have the will. I believe that at the moment the government lacks that political will to try to rectify a problem that is rife throughout Australia. A politics lecturer at Flinders University, Dean Jaensch, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Political advertising should be closely scrutinised in future election campaigns with both the main parties guilty of deceiving voters before the recent federal poll . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that Australia was now at a stage where truth in political advertising was absolutely necessary. While he recognised the difficulty of the situation, he believed that there was a need for some political basis on which the politicians, the political parties and the whole process came under a greater scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, this is not unique to Australia. An article from the United States describes a situation where there was misleading information given, in fact actual lies told, that resulted in the election of a person who admitted that, had he been more truthful in the assertions that he made, he would not have been elected. So the process has to have something done with it. Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act deals with misleading or deceptive conduct. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.</PARA>

The electorate held Malcolm Fraser to account for his 1977 promise of a fistful of dollars, which he subsequently withdrew. I think the swing against the Liberal Party in the 1980 election was due to the withdrawal of that promise made by Malcolm Fraser in the 1977 election. So it is the electorate that is the final judge on truth in advertising. </PARA>

That advertisement implied that, once in government, the opposition would scrub Medicare. That played on the emotions of the Australian people. It may have been effective, but it was downright dishonest. That is the sort of thing that the honourable member for Parkes is trying to come to grips with in the context of this motion. It has been shown since 13 March in the context of the budget debate that honourable members opposite are preoccupied with power. They are certainly not interested in people. In fact, in many ways, as the budget debate has shown, a lot of what they stand for is gained at the expense of the people. </PARA>

Honourable members opposite should take cognisance of what was said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter which I have raised in this House on several occasions before in relation to the raids carried out by the Federal Police and by Taxation officers on the homes of sportspeople in all parts of Australia on 28 April this year. It was reported at the time that these raids were carried out in an endeavour to obtain information regarding donations made by sportspeople and business people to the Australian Sports Foundation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also reported at the time of the incident that 17 search warrants had been executed and documentation had been received from a variety of organisations. On 9 June this year I wrote to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and asked him the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) In light of alleged comments made by the Federal Police when raiding one home, that those involved could be charged with tax fraud if any charge has been laid and if so, against whom?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) How many donations to the Australian Sports Foundation has the Australian Taxation Office disallowed?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) In relation to those for whom deductions have been disallowed, how many penalty notices have been issued?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Has the Australian Taxation Office sought to clarify the rules regarding donations to the Australian Sports Foundation?</PARA>
<PARA>It is not surprising that this matter was the subject of considerable press comment at the time. On 11 May I also asked the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) the following questions upon notice:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Has her attention been drawn to dawn raids by officers of the Australian Federal Police and Australian Taxation Office on a number of Australia's leading yachtsmen on Wednesday, 5 May 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Did she receive a detailed briefing from her department on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Is she able to say why the sportspersons and their families were subjected to the raid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Is she able to say whether the AFP forced a yachtsman's wife to change from her nightclothes in front of a female officer; if so, is she further able to say what justification there was for the action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Could inquiries have been conducted without resort to dawn raids.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Will she publicly apologise on behalf of the Government to the sportspersons involved.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister responded on 19 August in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. My information is that enquiries of a number of individuals were made by officers of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Taxation Office on 28 April 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. I received a briefing from the Australian Sports Commission, which is responsible for the Australian Sports Foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. My understanding is that enquiries by the AFP and Australian Taxation Office concern taxation matters relevant to donations made to the Australian Sports Foundation by a number of individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. I am not in a position to confirm details of the alleged action. This is a matter for the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. It is a matter for the authorities involved to decide on appropriate means of discharging their responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. See response to 4 above.</PARA>
<PARA>The further you look into this matter the more intriguing it becomes. On 25 February this year, the Australian Taxation Office wrote to one contributor to the Australian Sports Foundation and advised that the claim for a deduction for a gift to the Australian Sports Foundation was considered non-deductible by the Taxation Office. The letter went on to say that the Australian Taxation Office had considered the legitimacy of this claim in terms of section 78A of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Section 78A specifically disallows the deduction if the donor or an associate of the donor receives a direct or indirect benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have now received a letter from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) dated 7 October, some four months after my initial letter to the Treasurer. The Assistant Treasurer said, in relation to my question regarding the Federal Police, that it was a matter that fell within the responsibility of his colleague the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), and it had been referred to that office for appropriate attention. In relation to the other questions, the Assistant Treasurer said that he had referred them to the Commissioner of Taxation. The letter went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner advised that following routine enquiries in relation to certain claims for deductions, it was considered the circumstances were such that the matter needed to be referred to the Australian Federal Police for investigation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Assistant Treasurer went on to say that in response to my questions 2 and 3 Taxation Office inquiries were continuing. It was the final part of the Assistant Treasurer's letter that caused me the greatest concern, because he went on to say that he had attached taxation determination TD93/139, which was issued on 15 July 1993. The Assistant Treasurer said in his letter, `It may be of interest to you', and it most certainly is of interest to me. The situation is that the Taxation Office has been investigating this matter for a period well in excess of 12 months. Indeed, in a letter to one organisation, the ATO said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This office is currently reviewing the integrity of the preferred donation scheme operated through the Australian Sports Foundation.</PARA>
<PARA>I stress that that letter was sent in August 1992. The position now is that the Australian Taxation Office has released taxation determination TD93/139, which in my view has been introduced by it to justify its investigations and the quite obscene raid on sports people throughout Australia on 28 April this year. If, as was apparently the case in 1992, the Taxation Office was so confident that it was on legitimate ground in denying donations under section 78A of the Income Tax Assessment Act, why was it necessary to issue the taxation determination?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the Taxation Office knew that it was acting on extremely weak grounds: it had been embarrassed by the raids on 28 April, and the taxation determination was an endeavour to justify what were totally unwarranted actions. The Taxation Office cannot have it both ways. At the time that the letters of demand were sent to the donors of the ASF, either the Taxation Office was confident that it had legal justification for the action that was taken, or else it was not confident. Given the extraordinary events of 28 April, one would assume that the office was in no doubt. It seems extraordinary, however, that the determination was then issued in July. Honourable members, of course, will be aware that it is of a retrospective nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only conclusion to be drawn is that the Taxation Office was not as confident as its prior actions would have indicated. On that basis, I reiterate my claim that the events that culminated in the dawn raids on 28 April were totally unjustified and were an outrageous intrusion on privacy, the like of which we have never seen in this country before. The actions of the Taxation Office and the Federal Police on 28 April were inexcusable. I again call on the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the Attorney-General and the Treasurer to apologise to those sportspeople who were the subject of the April raids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time left to me, there are some matters from my electorate that I would like to raise with the House. The first matter is a letter from a Mr Alex Graham. Honourable members may be aware that during the Treasurer's budget speech someone was escorted from the public gallery. The letter to me from Mr Graham reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Michael,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am writing to you with a request to represent me in the House of Representatives in regard to my recent trip to Canberra where I displayed a banner in the House from the public gallery while the Federal Treasurer Mr John Dawkins was reading the Budget on Tuesday night 17/8/93. My action led to my eviction from the public gallery of the House in a most gracious manner by all concerned. I particularly commend the Sergeant at Arms for the sensitivity he displayed during the incident. He informed me that I would not be allowed to re-enter the gallery and no action would be taken against me.</PARA>
<PARA>In the same letter there was enclosed a letter to the Treasurer, and Mr Graham has asked me to repeat part of that letter. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Dawkins,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to sincerely apologise to you, all members of the House of Representatives staff, press and members of the public for any upset I may have caused during your Budget speech.</PARA>
<PARA>I have also received a letter from the Ballarat branch of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures. It is a letter to the Prime Minister, and I have been asked to read it. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Re: Enterprise Bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Executive Committee of the Chamber of Manufactures Ballarat Branch is most concerned at the continued lack of access for employers and their employees to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in relation to Enterprise Bargaining where the particular enterprises have non-unionised workforces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Real flexibility cannot be achieved in the Australian workforce as a whole unless the entire workforce has access to the Enterprise Bargaining process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is most disappointing that a Government elected to represent all Australians has to concede its position to that dictated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). It is all the more disappointing that such a position is taken by the Government under the guise that to do otherwise would be `unfair' to the Union movement. A concession by the Government to such persuasions is most alarming, given that approximately 70 per cent of employees covered by Federal Awards exercise their right to not be members of a Trade Union. What is fair, or `fair dinkum', in Australian terminology, the views of 30 per cent or those of the remaining 70 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are also concerned at reports coming out of the recent ACTU National Congress, including the repeated demands that existing award minimums are sacrosanct. These reports also iterate earlier comments by Trade Union leaders which are usually accompanied by reference to unscrupulous employers. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without question, enterprise bargaining achieved through genuine negotiations is the `lynch pin' to the turn around of Australia's position in the internal and external market places. Therefore, we earnestly request that a legislative framework be put in place as a matter of urgency and that, in framing appropriate legislation, the needs of scrupulous employers be addressed.</PARA>

The Leura mall, where the village fair was opened, is an extremely attractive shopping centre with a grass verge down the centre with blossom trees, flowers in bloom and attractively decorated shops.

In winter we have something called Yulefest, which has proved to be an extremely popular tourist attraction. It started some years ago when some visitors from Ireland were staying at one of our guesthouses. It was cold and possibly snowing at the time and they felt a nostalgia for their home. They were also quite distressed that in Australia they would be celebrating Christmas during the peak of summer. So the Yulefest tradition began. Many of our guesthouses and motels put on a special Christmas dinner and a lot of other festivities for that period. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry is an industry which is creating a whole new job market. It has been alluded to on a number of occasions by various members and ministers as our hope for the future for creating new jobs. It earns export dollars and advances the economies of rural and regional Australia. There are a number of ongoing tourism programs which the government funds, and there have been a lot of new initiatives in the 1993-94 budget. An additional $80 million is being made available by the government over the next four years. That money will help the Australian Tourism Commission to further the promotion of Australian tourism overseas. </PARA>

There is also funding for regional tourism development programs and for the national ecotourism strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national ecotourism strategy is particularly important for my electorate because of the environmentally sensitive nature of the area. If I tell honourable members how many people visit the area, they will understand why it is in danger. There are three million daytrippers in the Blue Mountains annually. Every one of those goes to Echo Point. There are an incredible number of tourist buses that go there and there is a terrible shortage of car parking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately $174 million is spent annually in the Blue Mountains. There are 600,000 overnight visitors. We would like to encourage more of them and fewer daytrippers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, in the Hawkesbury, the tourist industry generates around $30 million a year, with an annual growth of around four per cent. Daytrippers account for half a million visitors each year and overnight visitors account for 125,000. Obviously, I am hoping that the bicentennial celebrations next year will boost that number to the Hawkesbury because, apart from the area's natural attributes, the history of the area is extremely important. The Macquarie Towns Festival is another attraction in the Hawkesbury, as well as the bridge to bridge powerboat race and the annual agricultural show.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not always supported the activities of Mr Burdekin or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Even the title of this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human rights and mental illness</EMPHASIS>, is in some respects unfortunate and misleading. But the contents of the report are extremely significant and its many recommendations are worthy of the most urgent and serious consideration. The report presents profound evidence of the extent of mental illness in this country. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mental illness touches all socioeconomic groups in Australia, and there is growing evidence that its morbidity is greatest in the most productive working years when family responsibilities are also at their peak.</PARA>
<PARA>The report suggests that 250,000 Australians&mdash;1.5 per cent of the population&mdash;suffer from major mental illness and that approximately one in five adults have or will develop some form of mental disorder. Approximately one per cent of the population suffers from schizophrenia, up to 10 per cent of adults are affected by depressive disorders, 15 per cent of adolescents experience some form of mental health problem and more than one per cent of young people have serious psychiatric disorders. Between 100,000 and 140,000 Australians are estimated to be suffering moderate to severe dementia and this number is expected to exceed 200,000 within 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Alzheimers Association is the main support group representing carers and families of people with dementia. Ironically, just when demand for its services is surging, the association funding is threatened. Evidence to this inquiry strongly suggested that many dementia suffers are having to make do without any assistance from government services at all. Providing more resources for dementia sufferers cannot come about merely by redistribution of money. Nursing homes and hostels do not have funds to spare, so total funding for dementia and other mental illnesses in the elderly must be increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately 50 per cent of elderly people have at least one symptom of depression. The suicide rate for men between 70 and 79 is the highest of any age group in the Australian population. The report highlights the need for special psychogeriatric services. General adult psychiatry services may not be adequate. This can result in treatable conditions, like depression, remaining undiagnosed and untreated simply due to ignorance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report deals in depth with the emotional impact of mental illness upon the family. The report says that, with the initial development and diagnosis of mental illness, families are often plunged into panic, fearful chaos, trauma and despair. The plight of carers is especially addressed. Many indicate their own lives are totally dominated by the disease of the person for whom they care. Where a family member, for example, has paranoid schizophrenia and regards his or her carers with hostility and fear, it is difficult to rebuild faith and love in that relationship. For example, in the report, a teenage boy whose younger sister has schizophrenia said, `Tiny problems would turn into loud arguments; everyone was on edge'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Divorce or separations frequently result when the carer spouse can no longer cope with the burden of care, or where the illness causes a person to become increasingly aggressive or violent. The financial burden of caring for a person with mental illness, whether or not that person lives at home, can be considerable. The labour which families provide for their relatives with mental illness goes largely unrecognised. People in this particular position, supporting sick relatives in this way, need both support and respite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also deals in depth with the problems of mental illness in children and young people. In recent years, the report outlines that there has been an alarming increase in the suicide rate amongst adolescents aged over 15. After traffic accidents, it is the greatest killer of Australian young people. The most alarming increase in male youth suicide rates has been in rural areas and small towns. In respect of the status of mental health service for children and adolescents, the inquiry concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overwhelming picture is one of inadequate funding, inadequate provision of facilities, inadequate staffing, inadequate training of health and other workers, inadequate in-patient care, inadequate community and home based care, inadequate coordination between agencies, inadequate knowledge, inadequate research, inadequate data collection and inadequate commitment to the establishment of prevention and intervention services.</PARA>
<PARA>All these deficiencies, ironically at this time, are compounded in access and service provision for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people and also for those living in rural and remote areas. In this context, chapter 23 of the report deals specifically with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Witnesses presenting evidence to the inquiry were in general agreement that services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are seriously inadequate and culturally inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this place, where point scoring is part of our way of life, it would be so easy to score political points in respect of this report. This is in every respect a damning report, but I believe it is too important to become a basis for simple point scoring. As the report itself says, the many matters it raises demand an urgent, concerted and effective response. I hope that this will become a priority for the government and for this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So many of the problems that are evident in our society have money thrown at them. Although funding may be the answer to many of the problems that are raised in this particular document, I believe we should rather seek to identify what is causing the problems: what is wrong with a society where loneliness, depression and family strife are endemic; what is wrong with a society which treats its elderly with disdain and shuffles them off to places where they are out of sight and out of mind and treats them in the deplorable way that is recognised in this particular document; what is wrong with a society in which nobody seems to care much about other people's problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that our response to this document, other than being one of concern and of recognition that we have a huge problem in this country in respect of mental illness, ought to concentrate as much on prevention as on cure. The situation graphically portrayed in these volumes cannot and must not continue. As I said at the outset, there is much that Mr Burdekin has done and much that is being done by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission with which I have not agreed, and there are many people in Australia who may well share many of those reservations I have had about it. But I must say that the content of this report is extremely significant and that its many recommendations are worthy of the most urgent and serious consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for the work that it has done; the commissioner, Brian Burdekin; as well as Dame Margaret Guilfoyle and David Hall. I believe that this work will be extremely valuable to us in this place and I urge the government to react quickly, responsively and comprehensively to the many very worthwhile recommendations that are contained in these documents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to speak about banks in this debate. Before I do, I want to touch on the remarks made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford). I would say this about the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission: it is basically a fraudulent body; it is a body that seeks to denigrate Australia at every opportunity. I can tell the honourable member for McPherson that the problems he alludes to are no worse in Australia than in most other places in the world, certainly other places of comparable culture, and they are certainly not as bad as Commissioner Burdekin makes them out to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen Mr Burdekin's report into homeless youth. It is simply wrong. It is a massive exaggeration of the problem. I would say that Mr Burdekin is one of the great players to the gallery. He certainly knows how to squeeze out the last drop of funding and to make any issue an emotive issue. I hope the government looks at this report objectively and not with the emotional passion with which the honourable member for McPherson is looking at it, because I believe that Mr Burdekin is one of the great spivs of this world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about the Development Bank. There is real need in Australia for a development bank. We used to have one; we do not have one anymore. The Development Bank that we have today is just another grubby commercial bank that does not fulfil its charter. The original charter of the Development Bank was to lend money, basically on the ability and the good ideas of Australian people, without full regard to security. That does not happen anymore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in Australia today farmers paying PIBA over 17 1/2 per cent. That is an absolutely outrageous situation. The rural sector is in crisis&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;and we still have farmers paying 17 1/2 per cent. We find the good customers of the Development Bank paying over 13 per cent for their loans. Obviously, something is wrong. Unless something happens, many good farmers and good farming families are simply going to disappear. I believe there is an alternative and that it should be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the world today, there is money available long term at low interest rates. I know of one group that has access to this sort of money. Let us consider what could be done. If this group were, for instance, to borrow $5 billion, it could invest $1 billion of that money at the current interest rates, and over 20 years that would guarantee the repayment of the capital&mdash;there would be no risk to capital. On the security of this money, let us say the group were to acquire our stockpile of wool. At present the stockpile is a burden on the Australian woolgrower, I believe an unfair burden because the Australian woolgrower was only partially responsible for the debt. Clearly government&mdash;and I include in this both sides of politics&mdash;was equally responsible, and it is a burden that should be shared by the public. As I said, if such a group were to borrow money and get a banking licence from the government, with a charter to lend to industry in Australia&mdash;the charter that the Development Bank used to have&mdash;and if it acquired the wool, it would have a substantial guarantee to underwrite its loan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a bank could then go out into the market and say to the people who are now hopelessly in debt, `We are prepared to swap you debt for equity'. That is a situation where family farms that are presently being crushed by debt could be saved. They could swap part of their debt for equity and be in a position where they could trade out of their difficulties. It could be written into the charter that they would have first option to convert that equity swap back to ownership at, of course, current prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that any bank lending on this basis, if one has any faith in the rural sector at all, would have to make money in the future. I believe that the worm will turn and the rural industries in Australia will once again be very viable industries. I do not want to see the situation where we see the industry become viable in the future but find that family farming in Australia has been taken over by corporate farming. I do not believe that would be in the best interests of agriculture; I do not believe it would be in the best interests of country towns; and I do not believe that in the long run it would be in the best interests of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is ample scope, if there is some faith in the community in government, for providing much better financial arrangements to the rural sector and to industry in country towns. Without industry in country towns there is going to be no real decentralisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All governments pay lip-service to decentralisation. Basically, it is lip-service because the reality is that no government, with a few minor exceptions&mdash;and I would say that the minor exception recently has been the local council in Bunbury in Western Australia with its Bunbury 2000&mdash;has really done anything successful or substantial with decentralisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some bright lights on the horizon. I think that the Australian wool industry, while it is in crisis at the moment, will prove to be once again the golden industry of Australia. If we convert our wool into tops and sell it as tops, Australia's wool industry will once again be the biggest single export earner for Australia. If one considers the realities, wool is virtually the only unique product we have in Australia. If we mine, as we do very well at the moment, we are selling our technology to Third World countries. With our technology and their low labour markets, eventually they will undermine us; they will get our business. But Australian wool is unique. It is something that cannot be duplicated overseas unless we are silly enough to go on selling our genetic heritage, and it is an industry that we can manage very well indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the initiatives undertaken by Austops, initially at Parkes, soon to be in Hamilton and hopefully very quickly throughout Australia, will see Australia's wool produced into tops and sold as tops. Hopefully, the wool producer will get the main benefit from this. He does not get any benefit at the moment, and I believe that this industry is going to see us able to reduce the costs from the shearing shed onward for the farmer. I think we have to have a good look at reducing costs from the shearing shed and on the farm because there is no doubt that cost reductions are going to play a big part in future viability of farmers, and the technology that is available now must be incorporated into farming to make sure that that does happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool industry has shown itself to be resilient, as has primary industry in general in Australia. It has shown itself to be innovative in the past. I believe it has been very badly led. In fact, I am on the record as saying that the Wool Council and the Australian Wool Corporation have probably done between two and four Alan Bonds' worth of damage to the Australian economy. It is probably worse than that when we remember that Alan Bond did most of his damage in Switzerland and Europe where he borrowed the money; the Wool Council did all its damage in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, if we are to see the initiative of the farmers of Australia rewarded, we must have in place a mechanism to make money available to them at reasonable rates of interest. A real development bank should be re-established, by hiving off from the Commonwealth Bank the Development Bank as it is today, re-financing it and insisting that it adhere to its charter or simply by allowing someone else to come in and establish the bank to do the job that should be being done by the existing organisations now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every day when this chamber opens it is with the two words `honourable members' uttered by the Serjeant-At-Arms. One can almost sense the degree to which the people in the gallery, hearing us all called `honourable', raise an eyebrow or two and say, `Really?'. After that auspicious opening the Speaker stands to read prayers, and one senses from the gallery an even more cynical view of an act of prayer being engaged in by those whom the people there tend to label as hypocrites, even though the prayer has very little if anything to do with the Christian faith and could just as easily be uttered by Jew or gentile. The prayer, after all, is nothing more than a reminder of our own human frailty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that the gallery and the public of Australia, in their own superficial way, perpetually question our motives, our goals and our commitments, as well they might. In this grievance debate today, I want to give thanks for the good grace of the electors of a rural portion of South Australia. I am the member for Wakefield and proud of it. I want to give thanks to the decision of the electors of the nation of Australia. I am a member of Her Majesty's loyal opposition and proud of it. I hope those sentiments are shared by 147 other people in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That pride is, as you know, not based on any particular achievement on my behalf nor any suggestion that the electorate of Wakefield is uniquely represented in this place. Instead, it is based on the simple truth that we all know that once we are in this place we are part of a unique tradition of which we should all be proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great reforms of the free world in the 17th and 18th centuries occurred in chambers like this, where people whose names are now households words&mdash;the Wilberforces and the Lincolns and the Peels&mdash;stood up and made their pleas for things like the change of attitude towards slavery and the institution of things such as community policing. The emancipation of women was called for by people of both genders in parliaments like this. All of those people rose to speak from motives that are now universally lauded as being honourable. I want this afternoon to say, `And so are ours'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians ought to laud loudly what the parliament of Australia has done for Australia during its history. We have inherited a tradition from people who have guided this nation through difficult times; not perfectly, of course, but peaceably and generally in a well-motivated way. Members of the ALP and members of the Liberal Party of Australia should mutually applaud the roles played by people like Curtin, Chifley and Menzies in leading Australia through difficult times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look around the chamber in 1993, I see no-one that I know of on either side of this parliament who seeks to exploit anyone else. No-one that I know of in this chamber wants anything other than peace for ensuing generations of mankind. Everybody, as far as I know, seeks higher rates of employment in Australia, and all of us care for our electorates. Does that sound like an immodest thing to say?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who are most frequently branded as being uncaring in this place are not really uncaring at all. For example, some people think that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) is a bit of a cowboy in the way he represents his electorate, but the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would be the first to attest&mdash;and I would agree&mdash;that he cares for his electorate and stands up and says what he believes is in its best interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people on the other side of the House who are less than charitable in their view of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie's neighbour&mdash;and not necessarily his friend, but certainly his colleague&mdash;the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). However, as one whose privilege it was in his first six months in this place to share an office with the honourable member for O'Connor, I can vouch for the fact&mdash;as indeed can the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent)&mdash;that he cares deeply for his electorate. His popularity in the polls reinforces that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, if we wanted to take advantage of someone or exploit a particular situation we would not have sought political office. We have all been elected. We all endeavour to put Australia first. We all try in our own imperfect ways to live up to the term `honourable'. We all, I hope, recognise that we are imperfect. It is part of the nature of the beast to be anything but self-effacing, and so we tend sometimes to be arrogant, but at least we are endeavouring, in a way that the Australian community fails to recognise, to portray fairly their hopes and aspirations. However, if honourable members ask their children what they think of being the children of parliamentarians, they will discover that politicians in Australia are viewed in the most prejudicial way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only am I the member for Wakefield, and proud of it, but I am a member of the Liberal Party, and proud of that too. I think that honourable members opposite would equally stand and attest that they are members of the ALP and proud of that. All of us have a right to stand up for what we believe because we happen to occupy a particular seat on a particular side of this parliament, because we take a particular view of life. Being a member of the Liberal Party does not make me right, but it does mean I have a right to be heard. I want to take issue with the sort of nonsense that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) paraded in this parliament yesterday. I want to say without hesitation that neither I nor anyone on this side of the House, nor anyone on the other side of the House, deserves to be labelled as vermin or grubs. That sort of statement denigrates us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My task is to represent, along with my colleagues, all those people in Australia who did not vote for the government. My task is to represent all those people in Wakefield who did not vote for me, and on their behalf I am entitled to be heard in this chamber. The public might think we are out of touch, but we know that is not quite the truth. We happen to be red-blooded human beings who have to bathe and eat and sleep and do all the things that other Australians do. We live in families with spouses who do the grocery shopping and with people who are consumers, in common with other Australians, and our very election depends on our capacity to keep in touch with the electorate. So I think we have a tradition of which we ought to be universally proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course this will be a place of vigorous debate; of course this will be a place where differing views are expressed&mdash;so it should be. The thing we should laud is the simple fact that differing points of view are sorted out in this chamber and not in the streets. As a profession, we are not all that unusual. Put a funnel in Collins Street or Rundle Mall and take the first 200 people who walk through that funnel and one would not find a group any more representative of Australia than the people who are currently here. What was it that Menzies said in 1942 about the parliament? He said:</PARA>

<PARA>What should we do to improve the view that the electorate has of us? The concerns that everyone in this chamber feels were felt in 1942 by Menzies as well, and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What, then, must democracy do if it is to be a real force in the new world? In my opinion, two things.

I certainly would not want to misquote the Prime Minister.

But something he did say in his Redfern address that I believe we should be mindful of is this:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot imagine that we will fail . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that we will succeed in this decade.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that, with the agreement on the drafting documents for the native title legislation, this government has put in place most important and significant progress towards that aim. It has been, as I said last night, an historic moment and one that I was very privileged to share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a great responsibility on all of us, as individual representatives and in our electorates, to make sure that the reconciliation process goes forward. The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill does provide Commonwealth funding to assist that process, particularly where it involves indigenous people coming into classrooms and video material, so that school children, indigenous and non-indigenous, can actively learn to respect each other's culture and language. It is most important that it is in those opportunities for the education of the electorate where we will have true reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to give the House some examples from my electorate of where, with a mixture of Commonwealth funding support and local support and encouragement, the reconciliation process is happening. Firstly, I refer to the access course for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students at the Rockhampton College of TAFE. It is providing bridging courses which give opportunities for indigenous adults to undertake formal studies leading to employment, tertiary education or personal development. These courses are also being provided as an outreach to our Woorabinda community, some two hours drive from Rockhampton. Since 1987, 620 ATSI students have enrolled in the Rockhampton access courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The college is also working with the University of Central Queensland to provide bridging into university courses. Since 1988, the UCQ and TAFE have collaborated in enabling students to enrol in first-degree subjects. This year there were 20 students enrolled in that program, and they are doing extremely well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UCQ itself has established a support unit for ATSI students on campus, with DEET funding. It is called the Capricornia Aboriginal and Islander Tertiary Education Centre, or CAITEC. This unit offers academic, counselling, social and cultural support for about 170 indigenous students. It has been operating for six years and is considered to be one of the best in Australia. On Friday, 8 October I was privileged to attend the opening of the building to house both the CAITEC service with the general counselling careers and welfare section of the university. The building was named Nulloo Yumbah, meaning `our home', and it was named by Mrs Irene Hatfield, who is an elder of the Darumbel people, whose traditional land is in the Rockhampton area. Mrs Hatfield also named the university child care centre nGundarnoo Imbabee, meaning `children listen', which was officially opened earlier this year by the Queensland Governor, Lenean Forde. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is an example of, unfortunately, the tragedy of a language that is fast being lost. One of the great advantages of the AESIP program is to provide funding for the development of teaching of indigenous languages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opening of Nulloo Yumbah was the climax of a week's activities of cultural awareness sponsored by the University of Central Queensland with the active support of the vice-chancellor, Professor Geoff Wilson, and the board of the university. It began on Monday, 4 October with an art exhibition of indigenous painting in Rockhampton. Some of these paintings were done by what we might term indigenous street kids&mdash;kids who have been in lots of trouble. Through a very creative cooperative arrangement through the Aboriginal Legal Service, one of those services funded through ATSIC, and the local skillshare group, art lessons were made available to these young people. Some of them quickly demonstrated quite exceptional talent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ensuing involvement in their artistic endeavours which culminated in their attending this opening will no doubt prove a watershed in the lives of these young Rockhampton people. I can assure honourable members that I was most impressed with the standard of the artwork in this local exhibition. So here is yet another example of where, when we provide opportunities for indigenous people, they rise to the occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to pay tribute to the Darumbel Youth Service which operates under the umbrella of Careforce, the Anglican Welfare Service in Rockhampton. When funding to send some of our high school students to the World Indigenous Youth Conference in Darwin earlier this year was suddenly not available through a state grant, the Careforce people stepped in to make sure that the young people who had worked very hard to forward this project were not disappointed. When they attended, these half dozen young people had the opportunity to meet with young indigenous people not only from around Australia but also from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I was disappointed when I approached some business people in Rockhampton. Some of them had the all too prevalent attitude of those who say, `What are they doing to help themselves? They get too much anyway'. This is a most unfortunate attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the return of this group, we have had them go out and talk with other students and other community and business organisations in Rockhampton to show exactly what they have done and how much they have gained from the experience of participating in a conference of world significance in the year of indigenous people. These are the young indigenous people who will become community leaders in their own right. I am pleased to say that, with some assistance from the local member, we have a university group working with these young people, with the Darumbel Youth Service, to further educate the community of Rockhampton about just what young indigenous people are doing to help themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too often, unfortunately, it is the bad news that we hear about: what is going wrong and the problems that happen. We are not denying the huge difficulties that have to be addressed if indigenous people are to participate effectively and contribute to the future history of this country. But, on the ground, in many communities right across this country, with goodwill on all sides, and effective government and support from community organisations, a great deal is being achieved to support the indigenous communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important that we also dispel the myth that buckets of money are being misused and so on. It is understandable that, in harsh economic times, struggling people in the non-indigenous community feel that much money is going elsewhere. But, in fact, we need to support our hard-pressed community workers. An example of this is the Dreamtime cultural centre. This is really a living monument to Nola James, who tragically died recently in Rockhampton. It shows just what can be achieved for indigenous people. It is an excellent tourist operation and people travel to Rockhampton just to visit the Dreamtime Cultural Centre. At the funeral service for Nola James earlier this year in Rockhampton, one saw the true possibilities of reconciliation: a huge crowd of people came to pay their respects from all over Australia and from all areas of the Rockhampton and district communities.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who may not know it, that office is predominantly a one-stop shop where rural people who are in financial difficulties can come along and get things together, without having to traipse through a whole host of departments. There are now 22 of these offices scattered around Australia, and they are sorely needed. There are a lot of farmers in my area in dreadful trouble, for a whole host of reasons, but predominantly because of the high interest rate policy that this government ran for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After that excursion to Cobar, I drove a further 250 kilometres west to Wilcannia, on the Darling River, to discuss matters of concern with citizens in that town. Wilcannia is a beautiful town. It has seen much better days; it used to be known as the queen of the west at one stage, because it was the largest inland port in Australia. The paddle steamers used to ply the Darling taking bales of wool down river into the Murray and down to Adelaide. Today, it is sad to pull up there and see a town where murders, bashings, alcoholism, wanton vandalism and other such things are rife and have driven many people out of that town. Such is the importance of that, I intend to devote a separate speech to it on another occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suffice it to say that my efforts in Wilcannia these days centre on trying to alleviate problems and trying to keep good citizens from moving out of that town, as so many have done in recent years. If the government ever wants to see an example of the worst consequences of the handout mentality society, Wilcannia is one. I would like to see the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) get out of the capital cities one day and come to Wilcannia and see for himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later on that day, I pushed on west a further 200 kilometres and more to the famous city of Broken Hill. Having the only electorate in Australia that has two time zones, I was fortunate enough to pick up half an hour as I drove into that place. There was a little daylight left, and I scurried around town for a few meetings with people I had to see. Then I settled down that night for interviews with people, most of whom&mdash;perhaps not surprisingly&mdash;turned out to be angry pensioners and retirees who have been adversely and unfairly affected under the iniquitous deeming of income from unrealised capital gains provisions on their shares and managed investments that they have built up in that city over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a night's sleep, these interviews continued next morning, between radio interviews and a visit to the Sister City Association's annual conference, which was being held in Broken Hill at that time. While in town, I picked up a beautiful painting of brolgas from a Mrs Edith Kennedy, a talented Aboriginal artist who, with my encouragement, is entering that work in the $30,000 Aboriginal Heritage Commission art competition to be held in the old Parliament House here in Canberra later this year. So large was this painting that it just fitted diagonally into my four-wheeler. After about 1,500 extra kilometres, I was pleased to be able to deliver it at the beginning of this week without its having been damaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About midday last Wednesday I went and saw the local rural councillor, Colin Mew, and his lovely wife Jacqui, who acts as secretary, trying to alleviate problems of the pastoralists who live in that district. For honourable members' interest, the average debt of those people who consult Colin is now $375,000, on an average asset base of $1.1 million. Ninety per cent of those people are woolgrowers, I might add. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After that I picked up an Aboriginal gentleman, John Kelly. He is sort of an ex-shearer but now manages the Nyampa Aboriginal Housing Corporation. I drove with him down to Menindee, 100-odd kilometres south-east of Broken Hill. He was good enough to show me over the Aboriginal property that he is managing there, East Bootingee. John and certain other members of the local Aboriginal community are in the process of improving that farm with their sheep program, irrigating table grapes and certain fruits. They have got a lucerne project up and running now, and they have just planted the first of eight 20-acre wood lots with Silverton red gums, several thousand in each lot. They will harvest these after about eight years and sell the firewood from them in Broken Hill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I enjoyed a well-earned cup of tea after that with a local Aboriginal land council, and then knocked on the doors of the few businesses and the post office in the town to say hello to their people before heading 250 kilometres further south over a dirt road to Ivanhoe. I was down through that part of the world a few months ago when I well remember it was as bare as a board&mdash;not one blade of grass could be seen in any direction&mdash;but today it is transformed. It was like a moon landscape but now there is feed everywhere. In every direction there is a profusion of wild flowers and colour, with spear grass moving in the wind from horizon to horizon like a giant 20-kilometre Mexican wave. It is a sight to behold. I could not help but think that here was the real Australia that my soul certainly searches after, and would that more Australian people could see it. I suppose in the Australian tradition it will be a powder keg in a few months time waiting to explode in the bushfire season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pulled up and admired a couple of mobs of cattle that walked across the road and the cattle were so fat I could hardly believe it. To see them bags of bones months ago and now in the pink of condition is simply magnificent. If they got any fatter the farmers would have difficulty trying to shut their gates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I got to Ivanhoe that night, I called in at the RSL club and was grateful for the hospitality of the acting manageress, Vicki Fullagher. I had a meal with members of the New South Wales Farmers Association and addressed them on matters of concern to them, such as the increased fuel prices in the budget, particularly on diesel, which are impacting very heavily on the people who live in that district. They wanted to hear about what the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) is proposing in his industrial relations legislation, because they have concerns about that. They were alarmed to hear that federal road funding will be halved over the next two years, and they had lots of questions for me on Mabo. They are very angry about what is happening there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stayed overnight with Ian and Jennifer Farrar at `Tooralee' at Ivanhoe and was grateful for their hospitality. Jennifer, for the interest of honourable members, is the sister of Senator Amanda Vanstone. With no disrespect to Senator Vanstone, Jennifer is a slightly better sister because she chooses to live in the electorate of Parkes. I was grateful for Ian's time early next morning in showing me over the Willandra Creek water management scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later that morning I had the privilege of attending the CWA Darling River Group conference. I addressed the members briefly and later shared lunch with them in the CWA rooms. Needless to say, the tables were groaning with food&mdash;scones with cream and strawberry jam, potato salad, and a great variety of meats, all the wonderful things that are seen only at CWA luncheons. There were some interesting reports presented to the conference by one of the teachers at the local school, Philippa Kearney, and Wendy Jennings, the country woman of the year for this year, had driven 700 kilometres from Tibooburra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I learnt of many concerns of people in that town to do with car registration, the hospital, the rail services, the railway loco shed being torn down, and that there is no bitumen out of Ivanhoe and 20 points of rain mean people are stranded in that town. The police were having difficulty with overtime budgets, farmers were concerned with the RAS funding being cut back and also with proposals to cut back rural counselling funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had to leave the town prematurely the next day because it was starting to rain and I had to drive 150 kilometres out of Ivanhoe to avoid the possibility of being stranded in the town and unable to attend parliament this week. It was a great trip through the western area and I say that the citizens who live in that area are the salt of the earth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following that travelogue of drivel, I am sorry but I have to turn to something that is of great importance to the House. The findings of the Burdekin report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Rights and Mental Illness </EMPHASIS>come as no surprise. The Richmond report in New South Wales in 1983 contained some basic fallacies. Those fallacies were that it was cheaper to deinstitutionalise people, that all patients could be deinstitutionalised, and that that would help to remove the stigma of mental health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the real results have been that 50 per cent of the homeless are the mentally ill. Many have ended up in low standard boarding houses or in gaols or dead. Jenny Haines and the nursing unions conducted campaigns from 1982 to 1987, with a big strike in 1985. Those unionists were accused of being selfish, self-seeking and abusive of the rights of the mentally ill. Their concerns have been vindicated and they deserve an apology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are currently campaigning to retain the hospital at Gladesville, and they deserve support. Mr Petersen, the former member for Illawarra in New South Wales, has been a campaigner for 10 years, but few would listen to his calls to recognise that some patients need asylum. Some patients cannot provide basic hygiene for themselves. The application of the Richmond report has been a bureaucratic disgrace as the support services for these people have been non-existent and, in fact, it was never intended that they be put out there in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the implementation of the Richmond report has been a con, motivated more by the opportunity to sell prime real estate than by concerns for the wellbeing of the mentally ill. Dr Jean Lennane gives the following statistics. In 1983, there were 4,200 mental health beds; in 1993 there were only 2,000. In 1984 there were 2,200 community mental health staff; in 1993 there were only 1,600. So where is the support? Where are the additional funds that were supposed to go into that support? They are non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have more telling statistics. In 1983 there were 60 seriously mentally ill people in gaol; in 1993 there are 110 in Long Bay psychiatric ward, plus 120 receiving psychiatric treatment in the general sections of that gaol. In 1983 there were 120 hostel homeless people; in 1993 there are 280 to 300. The rest sleep on the streets or are dead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I called what was said before by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) a load of drivel! What is needed in New South Wales is a total moratorium on the hospital at Gladesville. There should be a moratorium on the attempts to reduce the number of beds at Macquarie, Cumberland and Rozelle from 300 to 80. More community nurses are needed to reduce the case loads of 80 to 100 to a realistic level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need the British Columbian model of institutions housing 20 to 30 patients, with full-time trained support staff.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning, my friend and colleague Rosemary Follett, the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory, launched a program called `$1 million in jobs' not only for the Australian Capital Territory but also for the surrounding region, including Queanbeyan. The partnership involves radio station FM104.7, Coles&mdash;which has a nationwide objective of increasing jobs&mdash;the ACT government, the Commonwealth Employment Service and the federal government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that these groups have made this morning in that launch, I think, is that part of getting back to jobs is instilling confidence in business and that some people are prepared to have a go. I am delighted that in this area FM104.7 and Coles are prepared to have a go, along with the territory and federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that a recent study of unemployed people in Europe has shown that in 12 countries studied the level of social security benefits&mdash;generosity to the unemployed&mdash;does not really have nearly as much effect as such important issues as productivity and the exchange rate. So if we are to get higher productivity, we need confidence in our work force and we need training. I am looking forward to the response of the employment task force. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The minister will recall the Prime Minister in this House on Monday making the point that `a valid lease is a valid lease' and `not subject to claim'. On Tuesday, the Prime Minister went further and said that `vexatious ambit claims . . . do not have a chance of succeeding' and `do not amount to much point when there will be a facility for real claims'. Is the minister aware of the lodging of four new writs this week in the High Court which seek native title over sections of Cape York Peninsula and prominent tourist resorts off the coast of Cairns?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I alluded to the Attorney-General because he was asked the most pertinent and direct question on this matter. In respect of other matters that have been raised in the question, I am aware of the fact that there have been a number of claims made over recent months which have been described by many people as ambit claims. I have unambiguously put on the public record a view that they are claims that have no basis in law, and I stand by those views. I think it is also important to note that those claims have been put forward, generally, by Aboriginal people who have been dispossessed absolutely and, therefore, have no opportunity to benefit as a result of the High Court's decision in the Mabo case. In respect of the interests of those dispossessed people, the government is moving to address their aspirations in the form of the social justice package which, the Prime Minister has already announced, will include a national land acquisition fund as well as other matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the so-called ambit claims that have been made, I want to assure the honourable member for Farrer that I am confident those claims that are categorised as ambit claims have no basis for success. It may help to inform the House that in respect of most of those purported actions which have been reported, regrettably, on the front pages of many newspapers as successful land claims, the writs have not even been served. I can assure the honourable member of the confidence of the government that these matters now will be properly addressed through the national processes that the government is putting in place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services. As the minister and the House would be aware, the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission inquiry into human rights and mental illness was tabled in parliament yesterday. Can the minister inform the House of the federal government's agenda for reform in mental health services and how this agenda will address the major recommendations of the report?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2386" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="HOUSING, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The federal government welcomes the report of the national inquiry into the human rights of people with  mental illness. The Burdekin report is a wide ranging report with recommendations covering the health, housing, community and correctional services sectors. The government appreciates the amount of work and the effort that was put into the preparation of this report by the commissioners over the last three years. In fact, the report is effectively an affirmation of federal government policy that people with a mental illness are part of the community and are entitled to live in it and enjoy the same range of services as other Australians enjoy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Burdekin inquiry began in June of 1990, mental health services were the responsibility of the state and territory governments. The federal government did not at that stage have a direct role in setting the policy direction. In the last three years that situation has changed. A landmark agreement was reached in March 1992 between the federal government and all state and territory governments for a five-year national mental health strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has committed $135 million to assist states to build stronger networks of community care; $107 million to assist state and territory governments to restructure services; $23 million to support innovative national projects; and $5 million for mental health research. In addition, we are providing upwards of $52 million under the better cities program to establish mental health services in the community before institutions are closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues raised in the Burdekin report will make a valuable contribution to the national mental health strategy and add momentum to the reforms already under way. A greater effort on the part of the government and non-government sector, the union movement and the general community is required to ensure that the objectives of the national mental health policy are met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anyone who has read the newspapers today could have failed to have been alerted to the fact that issues of mental health are very important issues of public policy. The fact that the opposition should have proposed, as it did in Fightback, to eliminate the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is an indication of how empty is the proposition which I read today that there should be some kind of task force in relation to mental health. The fact of the matter is that if the coalition had won the election there would not have been a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to release the report today.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am simply reflecting on the fact that this report emanates from a body which has produced a series of important reports. This is a 1,000-page report. It is a very substantial report that certainly commands the attention of the Australian people and, indeed, both sides of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the basic thrust of the report, what I am indicating is that effectively the Commonwealth, together with the states, has begun to carry out, through the national mental health strategy, much of the philosophy and, indeed, much of the thrust of the report. Indeed, if there is a criticism that could be made of the report, it is that it has been completed after a significant degree of the reforms foreshadowed in the report have got under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Notwithstanding that, it is an important report. The issue is wide ranging; it is not one for a single portfolio or for a single level of government, but it is an issue of fundamental human rights. It is one that, as far as this government is concerned, we will give considerable priority to. We will effectively work with the states which are at different stages in terms of developing their policy. I believe many of the concerns that are real to Professor Burdekin will be addressed as we look in detail at the content of this very significant report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;especially because the Senate is yet to pass legislation relating to the excise on petroleum products. But we are hopeful that it will do so later today. On that basis, I can advise the honourable member and the House of the impact on the budget numbers resulting from the various concessions that the government has made since the budget was announced and the loss of some revenue through Senate amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the outcome is this: for 1993-94, revenue will be reduced by some $26 million and outlays will increase by $75 million, giving an increase in the deficit of $101 million. For 1996-97&mdash;which of course was also very much part of our focus in this year's budget&mdash;revenue will be reduced by $286 million against the budget numbers and outlays will be increased by $348 million, giving an increase in the budget deficit of $634 million. As a proportion of GDP, the deficit for this year will remain the same, at 3.8 per cent of GDP, and for 1996-97, instead of a 1.1 per cent GDP deficit that we had figured in for that year, it will now become 1.2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against those numbers, one has to look at what the outcome would have been had the opposition been successful in opposing several key taxation measures. Had it been successful in pursuing its strategy, the additional deficit that we would have had would have meant a further increase in the deficit of $1.3 billion this year and an increase in the deficit in 1996-97, over and above the numbers that we now have, of $3.1 billion, which would have taken the deficit as a proportion of GDP this year to 4.1 per cent and, in 1996-97, to 1.8 per cent. So it is nearer to two per cent than to one per cent. It was the objective of the government in bringing down the budget this year to demonstrate that we would get the deficit down to about one per cent by 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question also asked about the economic effects of the opposition's strategy. Clearly, had it prevailed, it would have caused great harm to the government's deficit reduction strategy. We would have been well away from the one per cent, closer to two per cent. It would also have caused considerable concern in financial markets which had absolutely accepted the government's budget strategy. There have been a lot of favourable comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its October bulletin, which was produced this week, the Reserve Bank noted that the financial markets had been supportive of the budget. An outcome such as the one resulting from the opposition strategy would have led the markets to believe that fiscal policy was not under control and, in those circumstances, would have undoubtedly created pressure for increases in interest rates and probably expectations of higher inflation as well. It would also have created concern about the Australian dollar in foreign exchange markets which had already marked the Australian dollar down because of the opposition's attempts to frustrate the budget, again as noted by the Reserve Bank in its October bulletin published a few days ago. We would also have had considerable negatives for business investment because of reduced confidence by business in fiscal policy and because of the expectations of higher interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, had the opposition strategy been successful, it would have had extremely damaging effects on the economy. Our prospects for continued recovery would have been gravely damaged. By its actions, the opposition has shown clearly that it is not at all concerned about engaging in rational discussion on the issues; it is simply concerned about pursuing, for quite bloody-minded reasons, actions which are in direct conflict with what it says is its own objective&mdash;that is, to reduce the budget deficit. It is not prepared to engage in rational policy strategy. Patently, it is not concerned with the welfare of the Australian nation or the Australian people because the result of the implementation of its actions would have been so damaging to the national economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, as the cartoonist pointed out in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, those opposite have truly become the political fringe dwellers of Australia, in terms of the total political process put to one side, not engaging in rational discussion, not engaging in any part of the effective debate and pursuing policies which the nation will increasingly see as being totally at variance with its economic welfare.</PARA>

He concedes that he is alone among the states and the territories in his views, but he agrees that he is supported by the Leader of the Opposition and his frontbench.

I told Premier Court that the alternative was a decade of destructive litigation, with the development of his state being put on hold into the 21st century. I explained to Premier Court that we will be enacting legislation to validate the uncertain titles and to protect native title. Premier Court indicated that he will be challenging the legislation on constitutional grounds.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought the opposition would have been interested in a $30 million investment in an Australian industry. Certainly the shadow minister for resources and energy is not interested in it. My decision last week means that North Broken Hill can export 170,000 tonnes of woodchips from the port of Burnie. This is not an increase in the net woodchip export tonnages by North Broken Hill, but simply allows the company to transfer the export of 170,000 tonnes from the port of Bell Bay to the port of Burnie. This will be sufficient to ensure that the company can proceed with the construction of this new Hampshire mill, subject to the resolution of an appeal under the state environmental procedures and also the North Broken Hill board giving it a tick&mdash;which I am sure will be given, much to the satisfaction of members such as the honourable member for Lyons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that the construction of this mill will allow an expansion in North Broken Hill's plantation activities in north Tasmania, which is something I am sure the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and I would welcome. It will also ensure that we can have an internationally competitive forest products industry in northern Tasmania. It will also seek to ensure more secure employment in the long term in this particular industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the long term, the plantations will provide 80 per cent of the mill's resource as a result of North Broken Hill putting a lot of money into research and development. Australia can rightly claim to be leading the world in the research and development of new species of eucalypts which are frost resistant and which have the best fibre qualities to ensure that the right sorts of chips go into our pulp and paper mills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the pleasure of opening a half million dollar new expansion of the Ridgley R&amp;D plant in north Tasmania which will provide employment for a further eight scientists in northern Tasmania, which I am sure a lot of people in the electorates of Braddon and Lyons would welcome. The honourable member for Braddon was of course also present for the opening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hampshire mill will ensure that high quality eucalypts are available and will also provide the right sorts of input into the Burnie and Wesley Vale pulp and paper mills. This also ensures a more secure long-term future for those mills which have recently been sold by North Broken Hill to Amcor. The company has also given me assurances that the Tamar chip-mill will not be affected by this going ahead and that there is an agreement with Amcor that any people whose employment might be affected by the opening and the construction of the Hampshire mill will be considered by Amcor for redeployment. That is something which I know the honourable member and the Tasmanian trades and labour council were very keen to ensure. I would certainly encourage North Broken Hill, Amcor and the Tasmanian trades and labour council to work together to ensure that any people whose employment is affected do have training opportunities. I am sure Amcor will use its best endeavours to ensure that that takes place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made it clear to North Broken Hill that, if at some future stage it seeks to expand its exports of woodchips from the Hampshire mill, I will apply the arrangements which are laid out in the 1986 memorandum of understanding between the Commonwealth and Tasmanian governments to ensure that proper processes are followed. I am also aware of a proposal to develop a flitch mill in association with the Hampshire project. I am very keen to ensure that all opportunities for value adding in this industry take place. I will be monitoring very closely the negotiations on this particular proposal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before turning to the specific detail of the honourable member's question, I would like to make a couple of observations about what has been something of a pogrom by some sections of the media directed at sole parents, particularly sole parent pensioners. We have seen some outrageous vilification and caricaturising of that section of our society, and it is important to put a few facts straight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all seen the caricature image of a teenage girl deliberately having child after child simply in order to become eligible for the sole parent pension. The reality is that three-quarters of one per cent of sole parent pensioners are below the age of 18. The average age of sole parent pensioners, in the case of women, is 33; in the case of men, it is 38. The average duration of receipt of the sole parent pension is about 3 1/2 years, and a good many more are able to move rapidly off that payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appalling when we see phenomena, such as the results of Hugh Mackay's research, which show an upsurge of resentment in sections of the community directed against sole parents. It is very important to tackle those misconceptions and myths. The government has pursued a number of measures over the last few years to enhance the capacity of sole parents to provide for themselves. For example, there is the child support scheme, as a result of which the proportion of sole parent pensioners receiving child support has risen from 26 per cent to 40 per cent. The average level of support being provided through child support has risen from an average $44 a week to $58 a week. Under this scheme there are major benefits to the custodial parent, with $450 million going through the scheme, of which $310 million is going to the sole parents themselves to assist them in providing for their children. There is also a saving of around $140 million a year to taxpayers as a result of the operation of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member made specific reference to the jobs, employment and training scheme. That scheme is administered by three departments: the Department of Social Security, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, and the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services. It is specifically designed to assist sole parents who wish to re-enter the work force to overcome the barriers that prevent that re-entry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme is based on intensive case management, and both the Department of Social Security and Department of Employment, Education and Training networks have specialised staff working with this program. The three departments come together to manage each person back into the work force and assist that person in overcoming barriers. It is a comprehensive approach that includes arranging the provision of child care and other such matters. The scheme has been operating for a couple of years now and it is an outstanding success. In the 1992-93 year, only the second year of the scheme's operation, some 13,000 people were placed in employment as a consequence of it. That represents a 50 per cent increase on the result achieved in the preceding year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference is quite substantial between an average level of income being earned by people who participate in the JET scheme and sole parents who do participate and earn an income. It is a 28 per cent difference. That has yielded budgetary savings to the government of some $46 million. So it is well above the target of $35 million which was set for 1992-93. It is an outstanding program. Substantial numbers are also being placed in education and training: 11,500 sole parent pensioners moved into education; and 20,500 went into training through labour market assistance. It is a very good scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's approach, which is aimed at providing positive assistance to sole parents to help them get back into work, contrasts sharply with the approach of the opposition. As we all know, in Fightback the opposition was committed to reducing to 12 years rather than 16 years the minimum age of the youngest child for the parent to be eligible. At the same time, the coalition would have butchered the sorts of labour market programs that lie at the heart of the JET program. The opposition would reduce labour market program expenditure by 35 per cent, which represents 150,000 program places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, on the one hand, the opposition wants to push many more people prematurely out of the sole parent pension scheme; on the other hand, it wants to destroy the measures that are designed to help those people get back into the work force. It is an outrageous proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has recently reaffirmed his commitment to everything in Fightback bar the GST. He did that on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, so we can assume that those massive costs in public outlays, including those on most important programs, are still parts of coalition policy. Anybody who looks at the positions of the respective parties in respect of sole parents would have to conclude that the speeches made by the opposition's spokesman on social security&mdash;aka, the hound dog&mdash;professing concern at the problems of the disadvantaged are sheer crocodile tears and ought to be treated with the contempt that they deserve.</PARA>

<PARA>This bill was passed by the Senate on 20 October 1993. This bill amends the Migration Reform Act 1992 and other relevant legislation within the immigration portfolio to defer to 1 September 1994 the introduction of those parts of the reform act which were due to come into effect on 1 November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration Reform Act 1992 makes important changes to the Migration Act 1958. It simplifies the legal basis for administration of entry to and stay in Australia. It expands merits review by the Migration Internal Review Office and the Immigration Review Tribunal, establishes the Refugee Review Tribunal, and modifies appeal rights to the courts. It also establishes a detailed code of procedures for the processing of visa applications and reviews and clarifies the procedures in relation to cancellation of visas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is concerned to ensure the smooth and trouble free implementation of the reform act. Implementation involves far reaching changes to the administration of migration law and to administrative processes. The process of planning for implementation of these changes has been under constant review, and this review has highlighted the complexity of the task. To this end, when assuming office, the minister ordered a stocktake of the processes and laws to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the reform act requires finetuning, and this is to be expected in legislation of this nature. At this stage, a number of minor amendments have been identified, predominantly of a technical nature, which still need to be made to the legislation to ensure that it operates smoothly. These further amendments will be introduced in the autumn sittings of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Substantial drafting of subordinate legislation and consequential amendments to related legislation is necessary. Procedural instructions must be prepared. Major and complex changes are necessary to the computer systems and databases used to administer the migration program. Very significant training of migration officers is required, and a major information program to enable the department's clients to understand the changes which will occur is essential. In these circumstances, the government considers it preferable to defer the introduction of the reform act until all these issues can be adequately addressed. Deferment will ensure that the implementation of these complex and important changes will be smooth and trouble free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also provides that the provisions of the Migration Act 1958 relating to the detention of unauthorised boat arrivals continue to apply to persons who arrive up until 1 September 1994. The existing provisions cover the detention of such persons who arrive up until 1 November 1993. Extension of this date will mean that arrivals between 1 November 1993 and the new commencement date of the reform act will come under the same detention provisions as those which apply at present. The issue of detention of boat arrivals is being examined by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, and it would be pre-emptive to change the existing arrangements prior to consideration by the government of the committee's report, due in December 1993. The establishment of the Refugee Review Tribunal will not be affected by deferral of the implementation of the major provisions of the reform act. The tribunal commenced operation as originally planned on 1 July 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill introduces amendments which will put beyond doubt the power of the Refugee Review Tribunal to consider refugee status review applications made before 1 July 1993 to the former Refugee Status Review Committee and not considered by the committee at that date. These applications constitute a case load of some 5,500 review applications and are considered as a priority. The provisions made by this bill facilitate a smooth transfer of this case load to the Refugee Review Tribunal and ensure that the tribunal can get on with the work of clearing it. The provisions of this bill will not impact on the costs of administering the migration program. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 makes a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Three of the amendments are of a substantive nature while the remainder involve minor administrative changes. While the coalition will not be opposing this bill, I believe that it is prudent for us to make some comments on each of the key measures being proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these measures is an amendment to the Australian system of tariff preferences for developing countries. Tariff preferences were first introduced in 1965 to assist developing countries to compete in the Australian market. The system was refined in 1986 when a revised tariff preferential system was introduced. Under these revised arrangements&mdash;which still remain in place&mdash;developing countries are subject to tariffs which are five per cent lower than the general tariff rate unless the general tariff rate is five per cent or less, in which case the rate applied to developing countries is zero. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In  1989, Australian exports to developing countries were valued at $17 billion and accounted for 36 per cent of total Australian exports. Exports grew over the subsequent three years to $21 billion, representing 39 per cent of total Australian exports. Imports from developing countries in 1989 were valued at $12 billion, representing 23 per cent of our total imports. Imports grew along with our exports and by 1991 stood at $13 billion or 26 per cent of total imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, Australia has a surplus of trade with developing countries. In 1990-91, this surplus was in the order of $7 billion, rising to nearly $10 billion in 1992-93. While we also have a surplus of trade with ASEAN countries, its magnitude is much smaller: it was $2.8 billion in 1990-91 and $3.8 billion in the last financial year. Over 60 per cent of Australian's imports from developing countries emanated from the so-called Asian tigers: Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Malaysia and South Korea. In 1990-91, we imported goods worth nearly $750 million from Hong Kong and $1.3 billion from Singapore. Imports from China were valued at $1.5 billion and imports from Taiwan at $1.7 billion, while imports from Malaysia totalled $731 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall export performance of these nations was also strong. Australia represented only a small proportion of their international markets. For example, Singapore exported goods around the world to the value of nearly $US60 million in 1991. Taiwan's total exports were valued at $US76 billion. Hong Kong's exports were worth $US98 billion and Korea's, $US72 billion. Along with their strong export performance, the Asian tigers also lead the world in terms of economic growth. In 1991 the Singapore economy grew by 6.7 per cent, Taiwan by 7.2 per cent, and Korea by 8.4 per cent. The Hong Kong economy grew a little more slowly than its counterparts at 3.9 per cent, but was still well ahead of the Australian economy, which contracted by 2.1 per cent in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given their strong economies, solid growth rates and good trade performance, the coalition has expressed some doubts on a number of occasions about the classification of these nations as developing countries for preferential tariff purposes. Accordingly, we welcomed the government's announcement in the March 1991 industry statement that Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea would no longer be classified as developing countries and that their preferential tariff treatment would be eliminated. Under the new arrangements, the tariff rates which currently apply to the nominated countries will be frozen until the general rates fall to the same level. General rates will then apply to all imports from these countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes a second amendment to the Australian system of tariff preferences by abolishing the preferential rates of duty on a wide range of goods imported from all countries, except forum island countries, and 51 of the least advanced nations. These nations are nominated by the United Nations and include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Gambia, Haiti, the Maldives, Uganda, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Zambia, Somalia and Sudan. The goods to which the new arrangements will apply are textiles, clothing, footwear, chemicals, plastics, rubber and leather goods, fruit juice, canned food, sugar and dried fruit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, we welcome this measure. Indeed, it has long been stated coalition policy to put such arrangements in place. Any measure which makes trade a little fairer and a little freer is to be endorsed. Similarly, any measure which removes an existing bias from the market is a step in the right direction. Of course, this measure is but one step. Much more remains to be done to liberalise the world trade environment and to make our domestic manufacturers more competitive on international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So while I welcome the change to the system of tariff preferences, especially the eradication of preferential tariff treatment for the Asian tigers, I also call on the government to accelerate the reforms that will enhance the competitiveness of Australian industry. Wages and labour on-costs, excessive regulation and high shipping and other transport costs are all good places to start. As tariff rates continue to phase down to five per cent in 1996, these reforms and their cost benefits will become crucial to Australian industry. Indeed, the ability of many to survive will be dependent upon the government's actions in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment proposed in this bill eliminates the preferential duty treatment given to certain carpets imported from Canada. Under the Australia-Canada trade agreement&mdash;known as Canata&mdash;certain carpets of Canadian origin can be imported at concessional rates of duty, currently 22 per cent, as compared to the general rate of 29 per cent which is applied to all other carpet imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The elimination of preferential treatment follows negotiations between the Australian and Canadian governments. It is interesting to note, and perhaps somewhat discriminatory in terms of our domestic producers, that the preferential duty treatment was not reciprocated by the Canadian government. This means that while Canadian carpet imported into Australia was at a tariff rate five per cent below that of the general rate, exports of Australian carpet into Canada were subject to the standard rate. I understand that the eradication of the preference margin from Canadian carpet was sought by the Australian carpet industry, which was concerned about the continuing erosion of its market by Canadian imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad indictment on the policies of this government&mdash;or lack thereof&mdash;that industry has to resort to such a measure in order to maintain its output levels. The measure was announced by the government in Senator Button's TCF statement of July 1992. It was one of a series aimed at reducing protection for the TCF industry. Unfortunately, while the government did the right thing in reducing protection, it neglected the other half of the equation, namely, reducing the costs imposed on TCF manufacturers to make them more competitive. The TCF industry, for example, pays $300 million per year just in government taxes and charges. If that burden were at least reduced, if not eliminated, then imagine what this industry could achieve. Multiply that across the economy and we would see some major gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian carpet industry alone is worth over $60 million. It is the largest user of wool in Australia. Approximately 70 per cent of all wool processed to yarn or fabric stage is processed by the carpet industry. Sales in the last financial year totalled 45.5 million square metres, of which 5 million square metres was imported. Exports of carpet added another 1.6 million square metres to total industry production. In 1988-89, imports of carpet from Canada at the preferential rate totalled some 1.6 million square metres and were valued at just over $13 million. This dropped in 1990-91 to 0.7 million square metres, worth $6 million. We could presume that this fall-off was largely the consequence of the recession, low consumer confidence and a drop-off in consumer spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other key amendment proposed in this bill implements the third and final reduction in the excise imposed on aviation gasoline, known as avgas. The price of avgas will fall by a total of 3.013c per litre, due to three separate initiatives. A fall of 1.013c per litre is the consequence of the aerodrome local ownership plan. This plan came into effect in 1990 and facilitates the transfer of Commonwealth aerodromes to full local ownership. Aerodromes are encouraged to become commercially viable and eventually self-sufficient. Local users have agreed to accept financial responsibility for the maintenance of their aerodrome and, in return, the Commonwealth agreed to pass on the accrued savings to the aviation industry in the form of a reduction in excise on avgas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excise on avgas has fallen by a little over 3c as a consequence of this program. The coalition has supported the aerodrome local ownership plan from the outset. We are firm believers in the user-pays principle as long as the community receives the benefit through a lower tax burden. A further 2c a litre reduction in the price of avgas is due to two separate elements&mdash;firstly, the cost savings achieved by the Civil Aviation Authority following the removal of rescue and firefighting services from secondary capital city airports. The Civil Aviation Authority decided in 1991, after a comprehensive review and consultation with the aviation industry, local authorities and the Federal Airports Corporation, to remove rescue and firefighting services from secondary airports. It was agreed that savings to the Civil Aviation Authority from the removal of these services would be passed on to the aviation industry as a lower excise rate on avgas. The second element is the result of cost savings achieved by revised weather forecasting arrangements which require the Bureau of Meteorology to operate on a cost recovery basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of the House, I would also like briefly to run through the new administrative arrangements which this bill seeks to put in place. The Czech and Slovak Federative Republic received preferential duty treatment under the Australian system of tariff preferences. However, the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic was dissolved on 31 December 1992 with the Czech and Slovak republics becoming independent sovereign nations on 1 January 1993. The original act is amended to delete references to the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic and to accord the independent Czech and Slovak republics similar concessional duty treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 151A is amended to incorporate new arrangements which arose out of the review of the closer economic relations agreement with New Zealand. These amendments are complementary to the new arrangements which were introduced in the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. An anomaly in the classification of needlecraft and tapestry kits for tariff purposes is removed. Both can now be imported free of duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second tariff classification anomaly is removed so that boxes of not fewer than five handkerchiefs and one design and/or colour can be imported duty-free. Finally, item 53 in schedule 4 is split into two subitems to provide for the differentiation in tariff rates and their subsequent reduction, according to whether the goods are imported from advanced developing countries or less developed countries. As I noted from the outset, the coalition will not be opposing this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing my remarks to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2), I would like to concentrate mainly on the matters of developing country preferences. The bill's purpose is to provide a margin of preference to internationally classified developing countries in the Australian market. We in Australia, as one of the developed nations of the world, have a responsibility, along with others, through the United Nations to see that we assist countries that are classified as developing in order to allow the peoples of those nations to attain a standard of living which we have become very accustomed to in this country. The actual provisions of this bill eliminate some of the developing country preference margins in areas such as clothing, textiles and footwear, chemicals, sugar, canned food, fruit juice, dried fruits, and a range of others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An area to which I would like to address my remarks is the arrangements in relation to the pulp and paper industry. The pulp and paper industry in Australia is a large employer of many of the workers in the regional parts of Australia, and also in some of the suburbs of the capital cities. It is a very important part of the national economy. These changes do not take effect in relation to the pulp and paper industry in what are considered to be developing countries. There is concern being expressed in relation to this because two of the biggest nations in the world for investment in pulp and paper industries are Indonesia and Brazil, and both benefit from developing country status. It can be argued very strongly that this also needs to be considered in relation to this type of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes that have been made translate to a preferential tariff rate of four per cent for business papers, and the general rate is currently nine per cent. When the general tariff rate on business papers was 25 per cent, the application of developing country preference translated into a 20 per cent cost advantage to privileged importers. This cost advantage has now more than doubled to 42 per cent as a result of the lowering of the general tariff rate. General tariffs on business papers were reduced from 12 per cent to nine per cent effectively on 1 July, and there will be a further four per cent reduction by 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics from the ABS in July show that developing country imports, particularly from Brazil and Indonesia, account for over 75 per cent of uncoated wood-free white reel imports to Australia, 62 per cent of uncoated wood-free white sheet imports, and 80 per cent of uncoated wood-free white cut ream copy paper imports. So paper is a very big part of the Australian import bill that we are paying, and also a product that is competing very much with our own producers here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way the pulp and paper industry in either Indonesia or Brazil could be described as infant, or developing, or in any need of Australia's assistance. The industry in both countries is large and very sophisticated with world scale state-of-the-art technology plants. In one instance we may be talking about their economies as developing, but certainly those industries are large and sophisticated&mdash;they do have the latest technology. In fact, Indonesia's production is expected to expand from just over one million tonnes per annum in 1989, to over nine million tonnes per annum within 15 years. Indonesia is planning to use Australia as one of its target markets for those surpluses that it has when it has concluded putting its products into the large markets of the world&mdash;Europe, the USA and some of the national capitals of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia and Brazil enjoy huge support, including tax breaks and subsidies from their host governments. They also work under rather lax or, at some times, non-existent environmental controls. They also put into place massive tariff and taxation barriers which protect their own domestic markets and, in so doing, protect state-of-the-art large and sophisticated plants that have been put into those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Indonesia, its government imposes a cost and freight based tariff of 30 per cent, plus a five per cent surcharge. This translates into an effective free on board tariff of 45 per cent. If any of the Australian producers have a product which is superior to those in Indonesia or is in demand in Indonesia, they have to get through a 45 per cent tariff barrier to export there. On top of that, there is a further 10 per cent value added tax which applies on all sales made there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue that, far from being a developing industry in a developing country, the pulp and paper industry in Indonesia is, by world standards, large and sophisticated and heavily capital intensive. That it has a cost advantage over its Australian counterpart should not be unexpected. Australian producers are obliged to conform to stringent environmental requirements, while Indonesian producers are harvesting unsustainably huge areas of tropical rainforest, which they get at give-away royalties. There are many cases where the Indonesian industry pollutes the environment. It also has the opportunity, with the Indonesian labour laws, to exploit the cheaper labour force and, in many cases, the industry has many dubious occupational health and safety standards. To that point it is a developing nation, and we should recognise that it does need assistance, in particular in bringing its work force to what would be considered realistic rates of pay, conditions and standards of occupational health and safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean that we should forever treat the industry as one that does not have major advantages over its competitors in Australia. The industry in both countries, that is, Brazil and Indonesia, clear fells mixed tropical hardwood and rainforests and replants with an introduced species, the eucalypt. In addition to the exploitation of huge areas of natural forests with these low royalties, and lax or non-existent environmental controls, the exploitation of the labour force gives the industry in those countries a massive and grossly unfair cost advantage over its Australian counterpart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Countries such as Indonesia have relatively low labour costs due to the fact that they are able to exploit the indigenous labour force, and wages are often low and conditions poor. A typical wage paid in Indonesia is $US1.50 per day. Compare that with the conditions in Australia. I can speak with some confidence on this matter. In my electorate of McMillan, the Amcor company has a very large plant with over 1,000 employees. Over the last five or six years there has been considerable improvement in that plant towards enterprise agreements with the union movement. In fact, it is one of the first companies in the world in this industry to sign enterprise agreements with its union. The union movement there, under the enterprise agreement, has a lot of control over and responsibility in the complete operation of the plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representatives of the union, the CFMEU, have been in Canberra for the last couple of days speaking with ministers in relation to a series of issues. They would argue that, far from being developing industries in developing countries, the pulp and paper industries in Brazil and Indonesia are large. They have world standard operations and they have gone very heavily into capital intensive infrastructures. As such, they have that advantage, as expected. When our government negotiates with these countries on giving, and continuing to give, developing country preferences, this fact has to be considered very carefully by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia our companies are working to the highest standards. The mill at Maryvale would be one of the best in the world with its work practices, health and safety standards, environmental procedures, waste disposal, and in-house regeneration of much of the waste that can be reused. The fact that it can generate electricity to a great section of its plant from within by recycling is part of cost structures that the Australian industry works to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian companies are now competing against overseas companies which are very capital intensive developments assisted by developing country preferences. In addition, these overseas countries also export their product to Australia at what could be considered excessively dumped prices. One such case was heard in the industry recently. Indeed, Indonesia and other countries have been found guilty of dumping their product on the Australian market and, accordingly, some adjustments have been made to that product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the scale and sophistication of the industry overseas and the high degree of support and protection it receives from governments, we should review the action of those companies in dumping products on the Australian market. The developing country status should be reviewed on the basis that Australia also has opportunities for large investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that Amcor is now seriously considering a very large investment in Australia through its development of the Maryvale mill. That development will succeed only if the company is allowed to compete on a level playing field, not one that is tilted totally against Australian workers and investors. I commend the CFMEU and the work force at that mill and in other parts of Australia for the way they have worked over a period of years to develop investment parameters that are as good now as they will ever be in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to consider further the developing country preferences in light of the fact that companies such as Amcor are on the verge of making significant investment decisions. In the ongoing negotiations between nations on developing country preferences, now may be the right time to review this issue so that we can send the right signals and build up confidence to get that investment flowing in Australia. We are not asking for any special favours. All we are asking for is a move closer towards a level playing field. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Indonesia is a developing country, it is also a very important market for Australia. Significantly, in the future, many of our exports will go to Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and those countries to our north and to Brazil. Undoubtedly, those countries would understand that, as they develop and get the opportunity for massive capital investments of a world standard to enable them to become world leaders by the turn of the century, we in Australia also have responsibilities to negotiate and argue the case on behalf of our investors, producers and workers to ensure that our industries are also able to compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite easy to walk into a K-Mart store, a hardware store or any outlet that sells paper goods and find, as I have done in the last couple of days, goods packaged with Australian flags, green trees and all sorts of things which give a clear indication that the product is made in Australia. But scratch the surface and you will find that the packaging may be the only part that is made in Australia, and even that is not always the case. Whilst the developing countries are producing goods and seizing the opportunity to get out into the world markets, when people buy goods in Australia it is not always clear that they are buying Australian made product. That is another very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In debates in this parliament we have the opportunity to raise some of these issues. I am happy to support those people from my region who were up here this week. I commend them for the work that they have done. They have had the opportunity to speak to departmental people, as well as to ministers and their staff. I am sure that the negotiations that occur in relation to developing country preference will continue and that there will be opportunities in the very near future for consideration of some of the issues that I have raised here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesians and the Brazilians are hard traders and we expect that when they are receiving this sort of investment. At some stage we have to ask the question: for how long does Australia continue to support developing nations, and in what areas do we consider support is required? Indonesia and Brazil are planning to expand from one million tonnes to over nine million tonnes per annum within 15 years. We are now very close to the time when the situation should be reconsidered. I urge the minister and the government to open negotiation as soon as possible so that in the near future we can introduce further legislation into this parliament on these matters. I support the legislation before the House. I ask the parliamentary secretary to take my comments on board and pass them on to the minister. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I picked up a recently published document that compares our population, gross GDP and GDP per capita with those of some of these countries. I do not have the actual year, but I know it is very current. With a population of 17.3 million, Australia has a gross GDP of $US289 billion, compared with Singapore, which has a gross GDP of $US46 billion. On the other hand, Australia's GDP per capita is $US16,700 and Singapore's is $US16,331. That is a remarkable figure, when one has recollections of visiting Singapore, as I did, in the 1960s, and then seeing it again in the last few months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a little unfortunate that at times we are told that countries such as Singapore have a low standard of living. There are tourists in the shops in Singapore today, but they are in the minority. It is the Singaporeans who shop in those high class department stores.

When one considers the costs of surviving in Hong Kong, that is a very high standard of living. For Taiwan the gross GDP is $US204.9 billion compared with Australia's $US 289 billion. Taiwan's per capita GDP is down somewhat to about $US10,000. Thailand and other countries are mentioned in this list.</PARA>

In fact, if we do not watch out, they are going to be our rich relations. The first issue is this: why should such tariff protection be provided in the future to countries that are quite obviously on their financial feet? The answer is that it should not. Therefore, this proposal is worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night I was in Brisbane at a small business conference. One speaker had invested a lot of money in making footballs&mdash;something Australians know a lot about. Eight weeks ago, he got knocked off. It is no credit to our great rugby league institutions in Queensland and New South Wales that when he tendered to supply them with footballs they could not even give him an order for some of them. The balls that we see kicked by our Aussie heroes are all made in India. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He complained about the matter&mdash;if it were to hear of it, the New South Wales Rugby League might answer to this&mdash;because he had been informed that his original quote was the lowest but he was later undercut.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a pretty tragic little story. I might add that this person made it very clear that that was not the only reason for the closure. He also blamed the Australian system&mdash;the time that it took him, the problems he encountered with the bank, and so on. For example, he had been forced by a bank, or rather a financial institution, the QIDC, to spend $21,000 on a business plan&mdash;which he had already had prepared by someone else&mdash;and was then told that he could not have the money.

It had an internal bladder&mdash;a membrane made in Queensland, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) might be interested to know.

I imagine that I have raised this matter in the parliament before&mdash;I have certainly raised it in the public arena because foreign fruit juice is a major competitor of the Australian product. The honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) pointed out some of the factors relevant to Brazil, whence most of the fruit juice that competes in Australia comes. It is an interesting example of the problems facing Australian manufacturers&mdash;problems that go well past wage structures and the other circumstances that the honourable member mentioned as existing in some of these countries to whom we have afforded preferential tariff treatment. I stand to be corrected but, the last I heard, there was a 10 per cent tariff on Brazilian orange juice. The extent to which that has depressed prices for the Australian product is such that if there were a 50 per cent tariff it still would not afford sufficient relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be asking why the Australian product is so uncompetitive. Honourable members might be expecting me to say that it is the fault of that rotten labour market. I am not going to say that, because there are other reasons. To begin with, the industry largely operates outside the labour market. It is a small business, and the pickers and other workers are generally casual employees paid casual rates. That is not the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some real problems that we have to address. Some of them have arisen from the budget.

It so happens that our huge population centres&mdash;the cities of Melbourne and Sydney in particular and, for that matter, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide&mdash;are all on the coast. They are all slap-bang up against the ports they surround. So these low cost countries all deliver by the cheapest known means of transport in the world: international sea travel. It is highly competitive. Even considering the additional costs in unloading in Australia, goods cannot be unloaded much cheaper than by swinging a container off a big ship. So we give our competitors the cheapest possible access to our markets in terms of travel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what do we do for our locals? Australia is such a gigantic country, and of course its population centres have already used up the farming land nearby, that people such as orange producers have gone to the Murray River area. As I often say, it has been found, over time, that oranges do not grow too well on Bondi Beach, which has a bit of vacant land that might otherwise be used. I do not know how much longer it will be vacant, considering the current debate in this place.

We are saying to those people competing against imports, `We put you that far behind the eight ball'. If one were to knock on the door of Treasury, its officers would say that an Aussie motor car has $800 worth of those sorts of taxes built into it. So we say to businesses, `Here is $800 worth of lead in your saddlebags, but go out there and compete', and we wonder why they retrench people and do all those sorts of things to hang in there. It is a bit silly. It is not point scoring. It is an issue we have to address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about tariffs. The other debate about tariffs is one that says, `Your tariffs are worse than my tariffs', which refers to the tariff policies of both sides of politics. There is not much difference between our tariff policies. As I said, if we doubled tariffs in relation to some of the countries that have extremely low manufacturing costs, would it make any difference? It would not make much difference. We have a real responsibility to ask ourselves: is it sensible&mdash;I could add `proper'&mdash;to add the sorts of tax levels we do to businesses that want to compete? Take Victoria or New South Wales&mdash;the two big manufacturing states. I could fly out over western Sydney on the way back to Perth any night, look down at all its factories and see not a light burning. No light is burning at night because we put a special tax on working at night in Australia. We call it penalty rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there are certain areas, such as nursing, police work and so on, where penalty rates are part of their income packages. I do not know why we do not make it just that. We could say to policemen that their salaries will go up 25 per cent&mdash;or whatever it would be&mdash;and they will be rostered on in turns. When a business closes its doors rather than pay the money, it seems pretty silly to me that we do not do something about it. That is the other issue. We have to look at these things because we accept that the tariff regime has to be lowered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know where Hamilton Island fits into the tariff situation, but I was with Keith Williams last night and I can tell honourable members that he does not agree with tariffs. It was a very interesting speech he made. It was pretty rough and ready, but he stated his position very clearly. The point I am making relates to tariffs. We know the tariff lobby. People come to me and say, `Give us some tariffs. There isn't a level playing field'. I am the first to admit that. I think we have some real arguments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We refer to a margin of preference on carpets to Canada. What about the poor old pork producers of Australia who were told they had to take a punch in the eye and cop imported subsidised Canadian pork to protect the Australian beef market? As soon as they did, Canada cut back on our beef market. I do not know what we should do with countries such as that, but let me put it on the record that I believe any country that subsidises production&mdash;internally or for the export market&mdash;should be called a dumper and should be treated as such, with no further questions asked. Clearly, it gives its own producers an advantage. That is just another aspect of the tariff argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has to be understood about the tariff argument by those who see tariffs as the panacea is that, particularly in the Australian context, if we put prices up so the imported price matches the locally produced price, it does not take long before the local manufacturer needs more tariff protection. I do not argue with that. The unions, representing the workers, come in and say, `Hang on. There has been a CPI increase because this tariff structure has taken our prices up. We want a wage increase'. That has been fairly fundamental in Australia; I know it has changed a bit lately. So the employer who has been protected finds he has to pay a wage increase. Of course, if we give him more tariff protection he has to give another wage increase. That is clearly silly; it is not the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So how do we, as members of this parliament, help Australian industries? We can exhort them to do better, or we can look at what costs we ask them to bear. If we did, we would find that the costs were huge. That touches on another aspect. It was put to me by businesses the other day that, if they employ five people, half of one of them will be needed to do the government paperwork. That is not just the paperwork generated by the federal government; it is the paperwork generated by all governments&mdash;local government included. I have just been through a six-month exercise with a local government to get permission to build a small garden centre. It is a pity, because the people should be selling plants now while it is spring. Government regulation is an issue and one which I intend to address. I have legislation before my leader now. I am not going to run around as the shadow minister for small business and promise people tariffs. I am not going to run around, giving them awards for being good boys. I may do that; I want to recognise excellence. But that is not fundamental to helping them. It is nice, but we should not be abusing that and doing nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to address the tax burden. I say to people that the simplest way to kill the Australian economy is to tax transport. We are not Singapore. Many of the countries that we have been giving preferential tariff treatment to do not have a freight problem of any consequence. They have huge cities where everything happens. They have their ports there as well. Singapore, for instance, can be literally jogged around in a day, if not a morning. These countries do not have to worry about a bit of fuel freight. They do not pay it on international sea travel; they pay it on internal consumption only. They have huge fuel taxes but that does not matter. It is interesting because I think Asia offers the future to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at ordinary taxation. I know that we want to stand up and say that we have all these wonderful social security systems and so on. Asia has a brilliant one as far as the elderly are concerned. There is an absolute obligation on the children to look after the old. This system is probably more functional than the one we have because all of the children do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the total taxation revenue as a proportion of GDP. Every time people talk about tax in this place, they talk about the OECD. Total taxation revenue in Australia is 30.8 per cent; in Indonesia, 19.5 per cent; in Japan, 13.8 per cent; in Korea, 16.4 per cent; in Malaysia, 19.8 per cent; in the Philippines, 14.7 per cent; in Singapore, 14.8 per cent; and in Thailand, 19 per cent. The simple fact is that that is the burden that many businesses in those countries&mdash;many of which have been removed from this preferential treatment&mdash;have to face compared with the tax burden we put on our businesses and then say, `Go out there and multiply'. The simple point is we have to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People say the opposition played politics, but I am devastated that the government put an additional tax on distillate&mdash;diesel&mdash;in the budget. The parliamentary secretary, who is sitting opposite, knows what it means to his electorate. Diesel is the most environmentally friendly fuel that is available to us today, and it is the one the Europeans clearly recognise as such by selling it cheap by their standards. It reduces the freight burden for their manufacturers and encourages their motorists to drive diesel vehicles and save the atmosphere. The government has banged a tax on diesel, and not once did the Greens and the Democrats raise the issue of diesel tax. They want to talk about leaded petrol. Diesel should be cheaper than leaded fuel, but it is in fact more expensive. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As other members have commented, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) is an omnibus customs and excise bill. Whilst I want to take up a few of the points the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) have raised, I want to draw the attention of the House particularly to the fact that the schedule contains a reduction of 3.103c per litre in customs duty on aviation gasoline. This proportion of the duty collected on aviation gasoline was attributed to aviation authorities to perform services on behalf of the aviation industry. The reduction is a reflection of lower Commonwealth costs due to the transfer of aerodromes to local ownership and to the direct levying on aviation users of charges for services previously provided by the Commonwealth agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I welcome these measures but in my own part of the world in western Sydney we do not have the luxury of handing over a Badgerys Creek aerodrome to local authorities. Indeed, we are prosecuting a case that the government should really reconsider its current proposals of building an 1,800-metre runway and extending it to 2,900. I have spoken often enough in this place about Badgerys Creek, but I want to reiterate something I have already said, and perhaps say something else as well. About 2 1/2 years ago, with the entrenched opposition of the FAC to the Badgerys Creek proposal, I advocated the proposition that we ought to look at the possibility of private enterprise involvement in Badgerys Creek in order to provide a facility for western Sydney&mdash;indeed, for Sydney, New South Wales and Australia&mdash;much more quickly. I must say there were some even within my own ranks who criticised me for this approach, but I notice that it is being announced in my local newspapers that this is something new and revolutionary and that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) has just recently accepted it. I think it is fair to say that it has been his position for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I would like to make is this: I really think the minister has to take the initiative now to scope the possibility of private enterprise involvement in Badgerys Creek to determine once and for all whether or not we can get that private investment in Badgerys Creek and get the international airport up and running much sooner than it was hitherto thought possible. If the result is negative, I think we from western Sydney have to bide our time for a period before we reactivate the proposal in light of new evidence. I would like to be able to say that Badgerys Creek aviation fuel was being reduced by this amount but, as I say, we do not have Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor mentioned GDP and growth rates of various tiger and ASEAN countries. I would just like to quote to the House some figures that the library has developed for me. I think we have a danger that as our economy picks up&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in the House earlier this week in response to a question I asked him that in fact GDP growth accelerated in the quarter to 3.3 per cent, which is getting very respectable, and that was the seventh consecutive quarter of growth&mdash;we may become very complacent about what level of growth we should strive for and what level of growth is important to this country to develop businesses but, more particularly, to create employment growth opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at Australia's average growth for 1980 to 1990, we see that it was about 3.2 per cent. The average growth for Japan was 4.2 per cent; for Korea, 9.3 per cent; for Taiwan, 7.7 per cent; and for China, 8.8 per cent. If we compare our growth with that of the ASEAN countries, I regret to say that there is only one ASEAN country that Australia performs better than&mdash;the Philippines, at 1.6 per cent. The average in Indonesia is 5.5 per cent; in Malaysia, 5.9 per cent; in Singapore, 7.1 per cent; in Thailand, 7.7 per cent; and in ASEAN as a whole, it is 5.6 per cent. Again, I compare that to the average for Australia of 3.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess I have a degree&mdash;not total&mdash;of sympathy with opposition members, not totally, when they try to make the point that, if we want to link ourselves with our ASEAN neighbours and keep our relative economic position, we ought to seek to aspire to higher growth rates than currently are fashionable. Of course, in the longer term that would help us to reduce our long-term investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Growth plus equals the employment challenge: a positive agenda for change</EMPHASIS>, by the caucus task force committee, was released today. I would like to commend the two co-chairmen, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan), who I think have put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and come up with a pretty good report. In referring to the honourable member for McMillan, who I thought made a very worthwhile contribution concerning the forestry industry in his electorate, I thought I should recount the meeting the task force had with the National Association of Forest Industries. I must say it came as a disappointment and a pleasant surprise to me. It was a disappointment because in our discussions with the association there were so many ways in which government, an association and industry could get together to further develop the primary stages of that industry, and in particular the value added stages of that industry, to dramatically accelerate its import replacement and, indeed, export opportunities. I sincerely hope that the government does seize the opportunity, and I guess this is what the essence of seeking higher growth is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really cannot afford the luxury of having industries that are not making an optimum contribution to this country. I believe that it is not a matter of tariffs any more, but a matter of things like providing a stable investment climate and planning certainty. To me, research and development is always critical for an industry's future. Whilst we have led the way with our 150 per cent R&amp;D investment program, I regret to say that that has already been supplanted by Singapore,  which currently offers 200 per cent. If we are to be world competitive&mdash;I think we should try to benchmark&mdash;I think there is a challenge for the government to lift the rate to 200 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of standards, particularly given the honourable member for O'Connor's contribution, is a very important one. Small businesses find the investment required to lift their operations to whatever particular international standard is appropriate or required can often be significant or beyond their capability. But assisting those firms to attain that accreditation and standard of production can make a tremendously significant difference in terms of retaining their existing clientele and expanding it. I think benchmarking is also a very important approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I specifically reject, for everyone on this side of the House, the suggestion by the honourable member for O'Connor, the shadow minister for small business. He pointed out the lower taxation rates in the ASEAN countries and particularly noted&mdash;in his words&mdash;the great advantage of not having a social security system but having children be responsible for their parents. The question I pose to the honourable member for O'Connor is: does he believe in the longer term, as the per capita income of the ASEAN countries increases and there is a redistribution of wealth, that these countries will put their lack of an adequate social security network in concrete?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, it used to be argued that the fact that Taiwan did not pay any attention to pollution and environment laws gave it a considerable advantage, which was terribly unfair, and that it would never change. Now given its huge per capita income, it is able to spend an inordinate amount on infrastructure, the environment and pollution. I understand it has already announced a program worth in the order of $6 billion. Countries do change their approaches over time to issues that many people suspect they will not. I predict that, as the growth rates of these countries propel them into increasing wealth, their attitudes towards social security will change. We should not try to compare ourselves in this regard with ASEAN countries; I reject that suggestion. I certainly would not go home to the pensioners in my electorate and suggest that their children should be looking after them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The honourable member for O'Connor also mentioned the budget, with specific reference to the fuel excise. I would also like to mention the budget. If we really want to help small business, we ought to increase our national savings. As the Fitzgerald report indicated, the greater the government deficit&mdash;and that has led to a haemorrhaging of the national savings&mdash;the worse the environment for small business. If the opposition had been successful&mdash;if it had been supported by the Greens and the Australian Democrats in the end&mdash;in its blockage of certain proposals, that would have led to a worsening of our national savings. I suppose, to be fair to the opposition, it has raised this issue of national savings over a period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the proposals in the bill.

The lowering of tariffs plays an important role in engendering and nurturing a more efficient manufacturing industry in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill 1993 gives effect to the government's budget related decision to introduce new peer review measures to combat overservicing in the Medicare program, including pharmaceutical benefits. The government claims it will save $25 million by cracking down on medical fraud and overservicing this financial year&mdash;an almost laughable assertion. The government introduced measures to retrieve the money at a time when it could manage to grab only $4 1/2 million from doctors who cheated the system in the past four years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the election campaign, the government said it would help fund its health budget by retrieving at least $400 million during a crackdown on fraud and overservicing. Previous history has revealed a rocky track record in the matter of collecting the information. This bill places the responsibility on the profession rather than a government agency. The coalition has no qualms about that concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Audit Office issued a report in 1992 of an audit of the professional review division of the Health Insurance Commission concerning the division's success in dealing with medical fraud and overservicing. Allow me to inform the House of the report's key findings. Firstly, there was a lack of prosecutions and disciplinary action taken against unethical practitioners. The performance of the commission, with the exception of the last 12 months, showed little improvement over that of the then Department of Health in the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the commission's legislative powers to combat fraud and excessive servicing were deficient with respect to the investigation and prosecution of unethical medical providers. Thirdly, the medical services committees of inquiry, the main disciplinary bodies, were not operating effectively and needed to be either made more effective or replaced by a tribunal. Fourthly, the trend in pathology benefits was such that there was a marginal decrease in expenditure in 1991-92 compared with 1990-91. However, diagnostic imaging expenditure was still escalating, increasing from $470 million in 1989-90 to $550 million in 1990-91 and $595 million in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the ability to release information for investigating was seen as important in preventing medifraud, and the commission was reluctant to utilise its powers fully under the Health Insurance Act 1983 because of uncertainty about the effect of privacy legislation. The ANAO was critical of the HIC's performance in policing medical fraud and overservicing, noting that in the previous four years only 27 doctors had been successfully prosecuted and less than $4.5 million recovered. That is a pathetic result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With reference to the HIC's performance in operating the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, it was noted that data collection problems needed to be addressed before the commission could properly tackle pharmaceutical fraud and overservicing. An internal review of operations and procedures for the conduct of investigations undertaken for the Health Insurance Commission by Harvey Bates and Co. in June 1992 concluded that there was a need for a significant cultural change in the attitude of several management levels within the Health Insurance Commission in order that the review's recommendations on medifraud be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill that we are debating here is aimed at minimising the abuse of Medicare. It is the first of several measures the government will be introducing, and we have been informed that further measures dealing with fraud and double dipping will be introduced progressively. This bill introduces new measures to combat overservicing within Medicare and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals are the outcome of consultation between the government and the Australian Medical Association. The AMA believes that the amendments will produce a much more effective mechanism in combating gross overservicing, and has sought the support of the coalition parties for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key element of the legislation is the establishment of a professional services review committee to assess instances of gross overservicing where the practitioner involved has not responded to counselling by Health Insurance Commission medical advisers. It is important to note that in this case `practitioner' includes medical doctor, dentist, optometrist, chiropractor, physiotherapist and podiatrist. With assistance from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, a statistical procedure has been developed which will enable the professional services review committees to examine the pattern of a doctor's servicing, rather than individual consultations, in determining overservicing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present system it has been difficult to tackle overservicing because the committee had to prove that every single consultation was inappropriate. In some cases it has been relatively easy for doctors to mount a defence of individual cases. Now the procedure will be that if an inappropriate pattern emerges under the new system, the doctor will be asked to explain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Health Insurance Commission reviews the Medicare claims database regularly to reveal suspicious patterns. If the doctor cannot provide an adequate explanation, the data will be referred to the director of professional services review, and a committee of the doctor's peers will be empanelled immediately. The review will be carried out by doctors of the same speciality. The requirement that the committee will have to convene a meeting within 14 days and make a determination within 90 days is welcomed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential difference between the proposed new system and the current arrangements is the replacement of the notion of excessive servicing with a new concept of `inappropriate practice'. It is worth noting that this encompasses the existing concepts of excessive rendering and excessive initiating, but also introduces the concept of excessive prescribing. In addition, it will allow a committee to examine, where relevant, aspects of a practitioner's practice more broadly than purely the excessive servicing of patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new system is clearly a peer review process. The AMA has cooperated in the setting up of the new processes. The Federal President of the AMA, Dr Brendan Nelson, was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have an obligation as a profession to see that we stand up and judge the behaviour of our own members. Who else is going to uphold the ethics of the profession?</PARA>
<PARA>Who else indeed? That previous attempts to stem over-rorting of the medical profession have cost so much money for so little return represents an enormous waste of taxpayers' money. I refer to my earlier comment that during the federal election campaign the government said that it would help fund its health budget by retrieving at least $400 million through a crackdown on fraud and overservicing, when in fact it could manage to recover only $4.5 million over the past four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will closely scrutinise the outcome of these measures over the next year because there is every chance, judging by past performance, that this most recent scheme will prove to be just another example of the government's continued economic mismanagement. In particular, we shall be watching to see what the outcome will be in the costs of administering the professional services review scheme which are to be met partly from transferring the moneys allocated to the HIC to administer the current arrangements. The 1993 budget forecast that savings of $25 million are anticipated in 1993-94, and $64.9 million in 1994-95 from a combination of measures to reduce medical fraud and overservicing, including the enhanced peer review scheme. It is noted that these forecasts have been acknowledged in estimates committee hearings to be guesstimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 20 September this year Dr Nelson, the Federal President of the AMA, was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> as saying that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the AMA did not believe much money would be saved through the new system as overservicing was nowhere near the levels being claimed.</PARA>
<PARA>That buttresses the thesis here. It has always been the opposition's view that Medicare has been an invitation to unscrupulous practitioners to overservice. Whilst the government insisted on bringing in the system in the face of those allegations&mdash;allegations which were also made about the old Medibank system&mdash;it still cannot handle that problem. It likes to claim that doctors are at fault and that the costs are blowing out because of overservicing, but it does not have any solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition supports the government's approach in theory, and is pleased to see that the concept of the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness have been considered, nevertheless some concerns have been raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. It has raised two principal issues, the first of which is retrospectivity. The HIC can refer to the director the conduct of a person with respect to services on or after 1 September 1993, as outlined in the proposed new section 86, whilst the act as a whole will not commence until 31 March 1994. </PARA>

The reversal of the onus of proof is a device that the Public Service, the bureaucracy, puts forward constantly as a solution to matters it cannot handle. Of course, sometimes it is the case that the government gives it tasks that are impossible, and the only solution is a reversal of the onus of proof. If that is the solution, then government has to address seriously whether that is a task that can be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding, I have to refer to something that occurred in the chamber earlier today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not had close contact with health legislation as a member of parliament but I have had some association with organisations interested in the subject of mental health and, in particular, an organisation called the Schizophrenia Fellowship, which tries to address the tragedy of schizophrenia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A landmark report from the Human Rights Commission on the subject was released yesterday. I am very pleased to see how much attention the media generally has given to the issue. The subject of mental health has not been a popular public issue. In my experience, the people in community organisations who have tried to do something about it can be pretty sad, worn-out people. I have seen these people before parliamentary committees&mdash;they tend to be parents, but sometimes professionals&mdash;and I always have the greatest sympathy for them because they are struggling with a terrible problem. Our society, in common with most societies in the world, has been very reluctant to put mental health on the same plane as other health issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill. This bill is designed to introduce new, improved measures to combat excessive servicing and inappropriate practice by medical and other practitioners within the Medicare program. It represents the first instalment in a series of measures announced in the 1993 budget to minimise abuse of Medicare. The bill contains a strengthening and streamlining of the inquiry process required to determine whether, and to what extent, a practitioner has provided excessive or inappropriate services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current medical services committees of inquiry, MSCIs, will be replaced by professional services review committees. These committees will be greater in number, be better resourced and have greater power and flexibility to determine cases of suspected overservicing. It has been clear for a number of years that the current MSCI system has been ineffective. This can be measured by the relatively few cases finalised through the MSCI system and the extremely small amount of Medicare benefits recovered, when compared with the estimated level of overservicing over a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report No. 17 of 1992-93 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medifraud and excessive servicing, Health Insurance Commission</EMPHASIS> says that, in 1991-92, recovery of Medicare benefits through the MSCI system totalled a paltry $55,394. For the seven-year period ended 30 June 1992, the total benefits recovered by the MSCI were only $556,826&mdash;just over half a million dollars in seven years. In fairness, we must add to that the recovery from fraud prosecutions to get a comparison. The sum of $1 million was recovered in 1991-92 and about $5 1/2 million over the last seven years ended 30 June 1992. About $7 million has been recovered either through MSCIs or through fraud prosecutions in seven years. I note that the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) said that it was a pretty pathetic outcome. I cannot disagree with that assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report also states that the estimated level of abuse through fraud or overservicing could still be as high as seven per cent of total benefits paid, which for 1991-92 would be more than $300 million. According to the Auditor-General's report, we are looking at less than $1 million out of $300 million. I will return to the basis of that estimate later in this speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of the main reasons for the ineffectiveness of MSCIs were the long delays in dealing with cases&mdash;up to 13 years in New South Wales in 1984&mdash;and the need for the committee to examine every single line by line item when under review before ordering recovery of benefits if service was found to be excessive. As the honourable member for Moncrieff pointed out, every item had to be assessed. It was a pretty tedious process which recovered a very small amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the Professional Services Review Committee will overcome both of these problems. There will be a specific time limit of 90 days for committees to consider cases. The whole process&mdash;from the time it is referred by the Health Insurance Commission to the time that the determination is made by the delegated officer of the health department&mdash;should not be any longer than six months, which would be a vast improvement on the current situation. But, more importantly, committees will now be able to use sampling techniques approved by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to determine levels of overservicing rather than having to examine every service referred by the Health Insurance Commission. This will clearly maximise the revenue recovered provided a pattern of overservicing is shown by the statistical sample. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has been prepared following close consultation with the Australian Medical Association. Since the last federal election, the AMA has dropped much of its strident anti-Medicare rhetoric of the past 10 years. This was no doubt partly due to the Labor government's convincing victory in the 1993 election, which clearly established the popularity of Medicare, in contrast to the coalition's inequitable, market driven health policies. But it also partly stems from the recent change of leadership in the AMA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that the AMA, under the leadership of President Brendan Nelson, has cooperated with the government in seeking to overcome the problems of medical fraud and overservicing. The AMA has played a key role in the preparation of this legislation and has recognised the need to keep the cost of Medicare under control. For the first time, it has agreed to actively participate in a genuine system of peer review. Of course there are still areas of disagreement. I suspect that there always will be areas of disagreement between the AMA and the government. There are a couple of areas of disagreement that I can think of. The honourable member for Moncrieff alluded to the comments by the AMA that there really is not much overservicing at all. But in the next breath she said that all the overservicing is caused by Medicare and bulk-billing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition cannot have it both ways; either there is an abuse of the system or there is not. As I will go on to explain, the level of overservicing, which has been around for at least 10 or 15 years, cannot be attributed simply to Medicare or to the fact that ordinary Australians have access to health services without having to worry about whether or not they can afford it. The issue of medical fraud, and in particular overservicing, first came to public notice in the early 1980s during the term of the Fraser coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to 1982 very little priority was directed to the problem of abuse by doctors of the various health insurance systems. There had been no official recognition of the magnitude of the problem, despite various warnings by concerned officers within both the health department and the Health Insurance Commission going back as far as 1976. Two basic reasons can be advanced for the lack of activity in addressing this problem: firstly, the Fraser government was unwilling to offend its friends in the medical profession, upon whom it relies for political support and, secondly, the medical profession's historical influence within the health department's senior administration in those days. Until December 1982, the position of the Director-General of Health had always been a medical appointment, as were the directors of the state offices of the health department. This influence permeated throughout the organisation and was reflected in conservative and relatively inefficient administration. Further, it hindered any effective campaign against abuse by the medical profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first public acknowledgment of the extent of medical fraud and overservicing came in February 1982. It was reported that a leaked health department document received by the then shadow health minister, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), estimated that the level of abuse for the financial year 1980-81 was a hundred million dollars. This hundred million dollar figure represented about seven per cent of total Commonwealth and fund benefits paid in 1980-81 under the previous health system. I stress again that that was before Medicare was introduced; it was under the Fraser government's health system, which involved private health insurance, subsidised to a significant extent by the Commonwealth. Yet the estimate was about seven per cent. That was about a hundred million dollars in those days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA then immediately issued a press statement which supported that figure. The figure was based on a formula calculated with the aid of the fraud and overservicing detection system, known as FODS&mdash;a highly complex computer based system which produced statistical data showing servicing patterns of doctors. It is extremely significant to note that the AMA's endorsement of the estimate at that time was made on the basis of analysis by its own actuaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two important points need to be noted about this matter. First, the AMA, through its then president, Dr Lionel Wilson, supported the department's estimate of a hundred million dollars. This is particularly interesting when one looks at the AMA's position on this same issue in later years. Secondly, as I have already said, the estimate of a hundred million dollars, or of seven per cent of total benefits, was at a time well before the introduction of Medicare&mdash;at a time when bulk-billing was not available to patients other than social security beneficiaries. So that refutes the comments made by the honourable member for Moncrieff that any abuse of the system was caused by Medicare and bulk-billing. After all, it is a minority of doctors and practitioners who commit fraud or overservicing; it is not governments or anybody else. That is like saying that bank robbing is caused by government policy&mdash;or any other criminal offence for that matter. I think that point has been made pretty clearly by the comparisons of the days before Medicare was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following public concern arising from these announcements, the public accounts committee initiated an inquiry into medical fraud and overservicing. Public hearings commenced in July 1982. An interim report was tabled in parliament in December 1982, which was extremely critical of the performance of the health department. It expressed the view that the level of abuse was likely to be even higher than the official estimate. This report also resulted in the immediate sacking of the then Director-General of Health. It had already led, during the inquiry period, to the resignation of the Victorian Director of Health. The report was clearly embarrassing to the Fraser government as it closely followed the release of the Costigan report on tax avoidance&mdash;we all remember that very well, do we not?&mdash;and came at a time when the Fraser government was planning an early election. The government, therefore, acted with unusual haste in creating a number of new positions in the health department&mdash;more than doubling the staffing in the area responsible for surveillance of fraud and overservicing. A new director-general was also appointed&mdash;the first ever non-medical appointment to that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the election of the Hawke Labor government, the 1983 budget allocated $8 million annually for the new surveillance and investigation program. Further positions were created and training courses were prepared. I will come back to the training courses in a minute. In November 1983 the then minister, the honourable member for Bonython, announced that his department would embark on a five-year plan to reduce levels of overservicing and fraud to acceptable levels. This program was to be an integral part of the success of Medicare, which was to be introduced in February 1984. The administrative arrangements and the five-year plan outlined by the minister represented a comprehensive response to the problems identified by the public accounts committee's interim report, No. 203, in the context of the introduction of Medicare. Unfortunately, political events throughout 1984 seriously hampered the government's intentions. Throughout 1984 there was renewed criticism by both the government and the department of health as evidence mounted that the level of abuse was continuing to escalate.The public accounts committee inquiry resumed its hearings in April 1984, and the issue continued to attract significant media publicity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advent of Medicare on 1 February 1984 brought about a marked change in the attitude of the AMA and sections of the medical profession. Throughout 1984 and 1985, doctors took their own form of industrial action designed to undermine and sabotage Medicare. An element of the medical profession also started to wage a campaign to undermine and discredit the department of health's upgraded program for combating fraud and overservicing. The AMA, despite its endorsement of the official estimate of a hundred million dollars in 1982 as a level of abuse, sought to discredit the basis of the estimate, which had risen to $130 million for the period 1982-83. It was suggested that, as the department was not catching significant numbers of offenders, there might not be a problem at all. It was interesting to consider the AMA's sudden about-face on the level of overservicing now that a Labor government was in power and had introduced a universal national health scheme such as Medicare. There were also attempts within the department of health itself to discredit the size of the estimate. I guess it was thought that if they buried the estimate, they might be able to bury the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eventually, following months of controversy and speculation, the minister announced in March 1985 that responsibility for control of fraud and overservicing would be transferred from the department of health to the Health Insurance Commission. He also announced that the FODS computer system would be scrapped. The Health Insurance Commission, which had eagerly lobbied for carriage of this program, stated in evidence and in documents tabled at a public accounts committee hearing on 27 March 1985 that it would take a different approach from that of the department of health. That move attracted criticism&mdash;much of it justified. The Health Insurance Commission also stated that it would examine the FOD system to determine which elements of it would be useful for adoption within the Health Insurance Commission's computer system. It was clearly the expectation of the government that the transfer of the function to the Health Insurance Commission would lead to an improvement in the measures to combat abuses of Medicare. However, it was also fair to say that the decision, particularly the scrapping of the FOD system, was partly due to the relentless campaign of fear and undermining waged by the medical profession. Even the announcement was timed to coincide with the settlement of the New South Wales doctors dispute over Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the Auditor-General's report No. 17 1992-93, which has already been mentioned. This report examined the Health Insurance Commission's performance in combating fraud and overservicing. It concluded that there had been little, if any, improvement evident since 1985 when the function was transferred from the department of health. Furthermore, the report suggested that the estimate of seven per cent of medical benefits as the extent of abuse may still be appropriate. As a total, Medicare benefits&mdash;not including pharmaceutical, just medical benefits schedule items&mdash;for 1991-92 were over $4 1/2 billion. This would put the estimated level of abuse at over $300 million. For 1992-93, as the total of Medicare benefits are now over $5 billion, this would represent abuse of over $350 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this particular audit was in progress during 1992, the Health Insurance Commission also commissioned a consultant, Mr Harvey Bates, to review its investigation unit. His report appears to have dealt mainly with an investigation of medical fraud rather than overservicing. However, it is nevertheless pertinent to note some of the conclusions reached in the report. The honourable member for Moncrieff has also mentioned these conclusions. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the need for a significant cultural change in the attitude of several management levels within the Commission. Secondly, that the level and seriousness of medifraud is likely to have increased since the investigation function was transferred to the Health Insurance Commission. In part this could be attributed to a reduction in effort and lack of expertise currently allocated to this task since the function was transferred from the Department of Health in 1985. Thirdly, that the function and responsibility for detecting and prosecuting medifraud has never been successfully integrated into the Commission's operations.</PARA>
<PARA>One can only agree with the comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moncrieff, that the performance of the Health Insurance Commission in the last seven or eight years has been less than wonderful. It is something that I am very concerned about, particularly with my background in a number of different capacities on this issue, and having followed it fairly closely over the last 10 years. I know the minister is also concerned about that. This legislation will go some way towards improving the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation finally picks up the recommendations made in the inquiry of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in 1982, and again in 1985, including a number of submissions made to that inquiry and including submissions I was involved with from the former Administrative and Clerical Officers Association. I refer particularly to the use of sampling techniques and the reform of the cumbersome MSCI system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that this legislation has now been introduced, and is likely to succeed, obviously owes a lot to the different attitude of the AMA. Whilst people can criticise the length of time that this legislation has taken, that can be partly blamed on the fact that the AMA and the medical profession in the past have resisted all attempts to bring about proper surveillance measures. While the agencies responsible have a lot to answer for in their failure to address this problem, I believe there needs to be, and has been, a change in the attitude of the medical profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this legislation is welcome, and I support it and believe it is in the right direction, it will not succeed without proper administrative procedures. I once again point out that the Health Insurance Commission needs to address this problem. It sees itself, in terms of its corporate objectives, as a paying office: it pays doctors; it pays out cheques and it pays patients. That is its main operation. The compliance side, or the combating of abuses of Medicare, has taken second place. The estimates of $300 million or $400 million a year that are floating around are not insignificant amounts of Commonwealth revenue. That needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff was rather sceptical that the legislation would succeed in saving that amount of money. It will not. The estimate&mdash;I have not time to go into the formula&mdash;was mentioned in detail by the then minister in 1983. I refer honourable members to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>of 15 November 1983. The estimate of $300 million or $350 million, which I stand by as being valid, is only a ballpark figure on the cost of abuse. It would be like saying that, if one million people a year broke the speed limit on the F5 freeway and the fine for each person was $150, the revenue obviously would be $150 million. That is not the case, of course, because no system could ever curb every single abuse of Medicare by a doctor or by a patient. But the measures in place will have the potential to realise the amounts foreshadowed in the budget, which are considerably less than the amounts mentioned in various estimates. To that extent, I believe the legislation will succeed, and I commend it to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that there are problems in the finance and delivery of health care in Australia. However, there is little agreement on what can be done to solve or at least alleviate all of these problems. Fundamental to the whole debate are two central issues&mdash;an open-ended, fee-for-service system and the split of funding and delivery of services between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories. Increases in costs to provide and use medical services is a major problem. Providing these services contribute to their greater use, but the problems caused are complex and there are no easy solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Depending on their perspective of and role in the health system, individuals have differing views on how the problems arise. These include a link between bulk-billing and overservicing and/or overutilisation, regional variations in the number of practitioners in general practice, advances in medical procedures and medical technology, the ageing population and increased emphasis on preventative health care, including screening programs. The argument about overservicing and overutilisation is not a new one. The former national vice-president, now President, of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Brendan Nelson, described bulk-billing as `a complex issue that has become a cancer within medicine to which could be attributed much of the reduced commitment and integrity of some doctors'. The view of the former Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), said that `bulk-billing is not responsible for overservicing but that government and medical organisations are agreed that we have too many GPs, and that this creates an environment in which inappropriate servicing is more likely'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely difficult to determine just what constitutes overservicing or overutilisation. Section 79 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 defines overservicing or excessive servicing as `services which were not reasonably necessary for the adequate medical or dental care of the patient concerned'. How or who can objectively decide whether a service or series of services are necessary or not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a speech made nearly 10 years ago, the former president of the General Practitioners Society of Australia, Dr Dennis Mackey, highlighted this dilemma with a few examples. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GP who visits the old age home every week to see his patients is regarded by the Commonwealth Health Department as doing a `milk run'. Yet the patients regard him as a good and caring doctor . . . The young doctor setting up practice and spending greater than twenty-five minutes with his patients is regarded as overservicing by comparison with the established doctor down the road.</PARA>
<PARA>He could well have added: the doctor who orders a higher than average number of pathology tests but has a higher percentage of female patients or the GP with a higher number of diagnostic items but a greater number of aged patients or a large number of sporting patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that there is no such thing as a typical patient, let alone a typical medical practice. Deviation from an average may permit an assertion or influence of overservicing or overutilisation, but it does not constitute hard evidence. In a letter dated 8 October this year, Dr Paul Hemming, the current President of the Australian Association of General Practitioners, wrote to the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The association considers there is an urgent need to provide adequate guidelines to doctors, as to what constitutes inappropriate practice, so as to ensure that the ethical majority of practitioners are not unnecessarily threatened. We also have concerns regarding the limitations of legal representation and use of statistical sampling and extrapolation as outlined in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1981 the AMA announced that there was overwhelming evidence that 900 doctors were involved in medical fraud and overservicing worth $100 million per year. This figure represented about seven per cent of the total medical benefits expenditure by the Commonwealth and health funds in 1981-82. The figures on overservicing and fraud were then calculated by the then Department of Health through a statistical survey. The survey used a distribution curve of costs per patient per doctor, and an average was plotted near the centre of the curve. The area under the curve, to the right, was labelled `in excess', which amounted to $160 million. The department then made a rough appropriation that one-third of that was fraud, one-third overservicing and one-third legitimate practices, thus arriving at the figure of $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1984, however, only 29 doctors had been found guilty of overservicing and six convicted of fraud. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts issued a number of reports between 1982 and 1986 dealing with medical fraud and overservicing generally, as well as that specific to pathology. The committee agreed with the department's estimate of $100 million and said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the estimate is far from precise, the Committee believes it to be conservative, especially if one accepts that some overservicing is built into standard medical practices in some areas.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1992 the Australian National Audit Office issued an audit report of the professional review division of the Health Insurance Commission, concerning the division's success in dealing with medical fraud and overservicing. It found a lack of prosecutions and disciplinary action against unethical practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The performance of the commission, with the exception of the last 12 months, shows little improvement over that of the then Department of Health in the early 1980s.

It quoted the department's estimate of $100 million and said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this statement may well be true, there is no attempt to justify it and it may well be equally true that there is no evidence to confirm that the situation is the same or even better than it was in 1981-82. The statement stands as a gratuitous observation.</PARA>
<PARA>The department may well have added that the figure originally of questionable validity has now passed into popular usage, given the imprimatur of the AMA, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and now the Australian National Audit Office.

However, if there appears to be no hard evidence of the link between bulk-billing and overservicing and/or overutilisation, then neither does there appear to be any hard evidence of the extent of medical fraud and overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The office report was critical of the Health Insurance Commission's performance in the area of fraud and overservicing, noting that in the last four years only 27 doctors had been successfully prosecuted and less than $4.5 million recovered. This is the basis for the debate today. The Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services, in its comments on the Auditor-General's findings, noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is accepted that the level of recovery for both fraud and overservicing is minimal in terms of the levels of activity that some practitioners actually indulge in, this is a product of the Court's refusal to accept generalised evidence. Thus each and every allegation relating to a medical service must be proven. In practical terms, this is not possible.</PARA>
<PARA>The AMA responded in detail to the Auditor-General's report, pointing out that the practice of medicine requires complex decision making in very difficult circumstances, often with little and sometimes conflicting information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way a particular case is managed can be influenced by a wide range of factors, and it would be difficult for a tribunal, such as proposed in the Auditor-General's report, to make judgments as to appropriate care in a particular case. In a letter from the AMA president and the presidents of the senior colleges to the health minister in June, it was pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it is necessary to examine a patient's medical records, it should only be done by a professionally accredited group of the doctor's working peers . . . if the Commission considers that personal patient information must be examined either to verify claims or to consider charges of "overservicing", it should be done by a group of doctors who has no allegiance to anything other than proper medical standards and ethical behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA>The AMA has stressed to government officials in discussions on this matter that it is its view that the operation of the medical Medicare arrangements is dependent upon the honesty, integrity and professionalism of the vast majority of medical practitioners, and that aspects of the structure of Medicare, such as low general practitioner rebates and a lack of patient accountability, create an environment in which inappropriate activities can develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was further emphasised that involvement by the profession in the assessment of overservicing was on the basis that the emphasis should be on using resources appropriately, rather than considering the process as a mechanism for assessing the quality of care. This input and this cooperation have resulted in a new system which is clearly a peer review process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of persons on a committee of review will come from the profession or speciality of the person under review. The AMA is not the only group or organisation concerned about access to doctors' books and patient records. The view of the Consumers Health Forum of Australia was expressed in a recent paper. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ownership and access was regarded as a matter of negotiation between consumers and their GP and certainly not involving government agencies or anybody else.</PARA>
<PARA>I note in this bill references to services and samples of services. This really equals consumers or patients, and I trust that, when this legislation reaches the other house and is thoroughly examined by the committee, its members will look seriously at confidentiality, the use and possible abuse of patient records, and just what data matching there is of visits to doctors linked with tests performed and prescriptions ordered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that, while this information is available to the committee members who are peers, the data will be put together by public servants. There must be stringent safeguards for confidentiality and patients will have to be made aware that the days when their medical, family, physical and mental health records and other information were sacrosanct and strictly between them and their doctor are over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) said that this legislation should not concern the vast majority of practitioners. I caution otherwise and do so because of practical experience. When the HIC, acting on information from its database, decided to crack down on doctors ordering too much pathology, it did have some small success in isolating some who it was claimed were defrauding Medicare, and I applaud that. But the medical adviser also came knocking on the doors of women doctors whose pathology ordering profiles were higher than average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was good reason for these profiles. They saw more women patients, and women between the ages of 20 and 39 years are greater users of pathology. Another irony at the time was that the then minister put out a press release urging women to have regular pap smears on exactly the same day that the pathology crackdown was announced. I understand this fact has now been taken into account when examining doctors' profiles, but it is a warning that there could well be other hiccups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of its campaign for the last federal election, the government pledged to raise $410 million by 1997 through a crackdown on medical fraud and overservicing. This figure consists of $70 million in 1993-94, $100 million in 1994-95, and $120 million in each of 1995-96 and 1996-97. We wait with interest to see whether these savings can be made. I hope they can be. If there are dishonest practitioners making financial gains through deliberate, inappropriate servicing, I hope they will be apprehended and dealt with appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do have concerns. It could well be that education of both doctors and their patients could prove to be more effective than threats and wielding the big stick. Money the government devotes to these measures may be better spent working in partnership with various bodies to educate them as to what is appropriate and best for their patients. </PARA>

The honourable member said that the AMA appeared to find that there was not fraud and overservicing to the extent of $100 million. But in 1981 the AMA announced that there was overwhelming evidence that 900 doctors were involved in medical fraud and overservicing worth at least $100 million per year. I understood the honourable member to say that the AMA was not acknowledging that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also spoke as if there was only a slight decline in the growth of pathology benefits. The growth in pathology benefits slowed to such an extent that there was a marginal decrease in expenditure. That was pretty good in that time of inflation in 1991-92 compared with 1990-91. There was an increase in diagnostic imaging expenditure from $470 million in 1989-90 to $550 million in 1990-91 and $595 million in 1991-92. But this points out the conflict&mdash;a lot of people seek diagnostic imaging expenditure. Many of the cases that are drawn to my attention, and I am sure to that of other honourable members, come from people whose doctors say, `This is the best way for you to go'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Diagnostic imaging is extremely expensive. It gets to the stage that where the government is involved in health&mdash;as it should be&mdash;it can easily become big brother, whether it wants to or not. We have to have this continuing battle. Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits scheme benefits worth around $7 billion will be paid in 1993-94. The government is expecting to save a significant part of that expenditure&mdash;around $300 million&mdash;over the next four years, including $25 million in 1993-94 from improved measures to combat fraud and overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA said that there was overwhelming evidence about the figure calculated by the department of health in 1991. In 1984 only 29 doctors were found guilty of overservicing and six were found guilty of fraud. It is interesting that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts furnished a number of reports between 1982 and 1986 dealing with overservicing and fraud. The committee agreed with the department's estimate of $100 million, although it said that the figure was probably imprecise and probably conservative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Audit Office issued a report in 1992 which pointed to a lack of prosecutions and disciplinary action taken against what it described as unethical practitioners. There have not been a lot of media reports relating to pharmacies. As an ex-pharmacist I would not claim that pharmacists are any more ethical than medical practitioners, optometrists or others in the health field. I think I am the same bloke, and I am regarded as a lot less ethical in the job I have now than I was when I was at the top of the ladder as a pharmacist some 10 or 11 years ago. </PARA>

The Pharmaceutical Remuneration Tribunal comes to a decision about fees after receiving evidence from government and pharmacists. But that does not happen with doctors. We have this fee for service where doctors can continually change their fees. I would say to the honourable member for Adelaide that there are as many problems, if not more, with fee for service as there are with bulk-billing. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) and the honourable member for Adelaide pointed out that the Health Insurance Commission's legislative powers to combat fraud and excessive servicing are deficient in regard to the investigation and prosecution of unethical medical providers. The main disciplinary bodies are not operating effectively. They need to be made more effective. Let us hope that the action being taken here achieves that result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been quite a substantial move from the days when doctors were able to ignore cost considerations on the grounds that these concerns interfered with their role as healers. When I first started in pharmacy&mdash;I am not talking about being a bottlewasher or a messenger, but when I started as an apprentice in the early 1950s&mdash;doctors were able to ignore cost considerations. In the first Menzies-Page pharmaceutical benefits scheme&mdash;substantially based on the Chifley proposal&mdash;the health costs were not all that high, relatively, as a percentage of GDP to the government or to the patients. Some items like heroin were a hell of a lot cheaper. What used to cost about eight shillings would now cost about $25 or $50, but people are paying about $2,000 in the streets to get a product of very deficient quality. I will leave that for debate on another day before you pull me up, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One former Melbourne hospital executive was fond of commenting that the most expensive implement in any hospital was a pen in the hand of a first year resident ordering a battery of tests and any other procedures that he or she could think of. That is changing, and full credit to the medical profession. The profession is moving with the times. The honourable member for Macarthur and the honourable member for Adelaide have both referred to the present leadership of the AMA. It is a constructive leadership, and I am sure that the minister has taken a positive attitude. I believe that the minister and the AMA will come up with a proposal that will stand the test of time. It is certainly worth pursuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a lot of complaints about the professions, and sometimes an illegal service is associated with higher costs. Here in the Australian Capital Territory a practitioner was charged with illegally administering electro-convulsive therapy to a patient. The treatment was initially opposed by the woman, but later on she was persuaded. She asked for the treatment and signed the relevant documents. It was supplied illegally, and the practitioner was charged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite often there are problems where patients themselves can abuse the scheme. In the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 30 October 1992 Tim Pegler mentions a patient who had visited the Preston clinic 14 times and had seen eight different doctors. Doctor Barbagallo was the eighth doctor to see Mrs Donovan and he immediately noticed `her attendances were drug-seeking in nature'. I can recall people like that in my own former profession. Patients would go to doctors and we would nickname them `grocery lists'. We would find a list of 18 or 19 items that the patient had asked the doctor to prescribe. That was particularly so with patients who were on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme or the veterans scheme. That has changed substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard of a case in Britain where a veterans scheme patient actually upholstered his couch with cottonwool obtained from a doctor. That sort of thing has been much more strictly policed. But sometimes there is a problem in working out where to start and where to stop. For instance, there has been public and media outrage over the infamous affair at Chelmsford psychiatric hospital. All that has really happened is that 30 former patients received compensation from the victims compensation tribunal at an average of $36,000 each. There was certainly an abuse of chemical treatment, but not all chemical treatment is an abuse of the patient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall coming across a qualified Chinese doctor in the Australian Capital Territory who believed in combining western and eastern medicine. He looked at the environment in which the patient lived. Every type of medicine can have its place. For instance, it is rather silly to say that valium ought to be completely banned; it has its place. In the year I left pharmacy I can recall the old brompton cocktail being dispensed. It was a cocktail of cocaine, morphine, whisky and phenobarbitone&mdash;barbiturates&mdash;which was given to terminally ill cancer patients. It certainly made them feel a lot better and a lot happier. The only problem was that it was not natural for the relatives to see the dying person in such happy circumstances. Nevertheless, it did work. So there is a place for an open attitude in medicine. Sometimes we can become too restrictive and ignore that place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal health department involved the La Trobe University's National Centre for Socio-Legal Studies in a project that undertook an intensive study of 24 victims.

It is not always easy for patients to make complaints about some medical practices, as the Chelmsford group found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always this dilemma: should people be able to make complaints easily; should they be able to litigate, as is happening extensively in the United States; and, if so, where should we draw the line?

<PARA>One of the problems the government identified when formulating this proposed legislation is the federal system. It is evident that the complaint systems in most states do not encourage complainants to come forward. The complaints figures over the last few years show that New South Wales has the highest number of reports of sexual abuse by doctors. As a resident of that state, I point out that that does not mean that the doctors in New South Wales are any worse or any better than those in other states or territories. It probably says that the public in some states does not have as much confidence in making a complaint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cases were reported where doctors were not only sexually abusing patients, but doing so on Medicare, obtaining benefits for the time spent with the patient. I would like to refer to Dr Brendan Nelson, someone for whom I have a great deal of respect. He believes that the incidence is much less frequent in Australia. Here we have another example of an activity which is unethical, if not illegal, associated with overcharging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson mooted a proposal for matching state and federal patient records as a way of tackling the rorts, but the problem there was the rivalry between state and federal governments over the control of health budgets and the sharing of information. The Victorian Minister for Health, Ms Tehan, has said that she would release state hospital records to federal authorities investigating fraud but would not agree to routine matching of state and federal data. However, I imagine that if one government has the data, it is possible for another to get the data. At least, for the first time, the states and the Commonwealth have agreed to share information on Medicare fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation responds to a number of the Auditor-General's key findings: a lack of prosecutions and disciplinary action; a deficiency in the Health Insurance Commission's legislative powers to combat fraud and overservicing; the inefficient operation of the medical services committee of inquiry; the slowing in growth of pathology benefits; and the need for release of information for investigative purposes, particularly in preventing medifraud.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I offer comments from a different perspective from those made so far. There are a considerable number of aspects of the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill which I find disturbing. I do not propose to mention data-matching among them. I will confine my remarks to one aspect&mdash;namely, the nature of the professional services review proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest achievements of the judiciary in the common law world in the last 40 years has been an ongoing development of a discrete body of administrative law. A feature of this body of law is the set of principles concerned with what used to be called `natural justice', but which is now more accurately described as `procedural fairness'. One of the major areas to which these principles has relevance is that of investigations for the purpose of possible prosecution or disciplinary proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many decades, the common law has laid down a well-known set of rules regarding the conduct of prosecutions before courts&mdash;whether before judges and juries, or before magistrates. The development of administrative law principles applicable to disciplinary proceedings before non-judicial tribunals and bodies, such as professional disciplinary tribunals, is a more recent phenomenon. It is one in which great strides have been made in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distinction between an investigation or inquisitorial process on the one hand, and a proceeding in the nature of a prosecution or disciplinary proceeding on the other hand, is fundamental. What is procedurally fair in one may be a cause of gross injustice in the other. The investigation generally does not result directly in rights being lost or obligations being imposed. The object is simply to unearth what has occurred, generally for further reference or further proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a disciplinary proceeding the opposite is the case. An unfavourable finding may result in a heavy penalty, with enormous direct and indirect consequences for the subject of the proceeding. It is imperative, I suggest, that this government should recognise the distinction and should not lightly approve any blurring of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, I do not wish to aid any professional who wrongly seeks to make unlawful or improper profit from breaches of professional standards or from illegal conduct. On the other hand, I do not wish to be party to any legislation which establishes a star chamber process for reviewing the conduct of professional persons or any other person and which enables the imposition of a penalty, particularly one such as striking off or suspension from practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order that I make plain why I object to the procedure proposed, let me briefly refer to some of the principles of procedural fairness. The courts have laid down a variety of principles which will apply in a variety of ways and in a variety of circumstances, but subject to any statutory provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One principle which may be stated at the outset is that a person is entitled to be heard and must be given prior notice of any hearing and of its purpose. The notice must be adequate in the sense of giving the person sufficient time and information to prepare effectively and present his or her case; and arrange to attend the hearing or submit written representations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are different requirements in the case of investigations as against prosecutions. In the one case, a general indication of the area to be reviewed may be adequate; in the other case, it is important that the person to be dealt with be precisely advised as to what is the subject matter of the proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another requirement concerns the manner of the hearing. It is recognised that the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted will vary according to the circumstances. The distinction between a duty to inquire and a duty to adjudicate, and between making findings of guilt on the one hand and collecting facts and opinions for the making of policy decision on the other, is important in considering the choice of procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Principles of natural justice may also require a right to legal or lay representation, although whether representation is necessary to secure a fair hearing will, again, depend on all the circumstances of the particular case. Statutes may exclude the formal rules of evidence, but natural justice requires that the material on which any finding is based must be relevant and logically probative. A fair hearing must also include the opportunity to comment on and controvert relevant information adverse to one's case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Natural justice may require that a discrete hearing on the penalty be conducted where the penalty is in the discretion of the tribunal. In this regard, the courts have recognised that it is only fair that a person found guilty of a charge carrying a discretionary penalty be afforded, at some stage in the proceedings, a distinct opportunity to persuade the tribunal that a reduced penalty, or no penalty at all, should be imposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is beyond doubt that legislation can exclude the principles of natural justice where they would otherwise be implied by the courts, provided that the intention to exclude natural justice is unambiguously clear. It is another question entirely whether legislation should exclude the principles of natural justice. This is particularly relevant, given the fact that both the House of Lords and the High Court have held that professional bodies are obliged to apply the highest standards of natural justice when disciplining their members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does the proposed legislation measure up against these principles of natural justice or procedural fairness? Under the present provisions of the Health Insurance Act 1973, a medical services committee of inquiry is established for each state. It consists of five medical practitioners whose functions include inquiring into and reporting to the minister on any matter concerning alleged overservicing referred to the committee by the minister. After the committee considers a matter referred to it by the minister, and it appears to the committee that a practitioner or other person may have initiated, caused, or permitted overservicing, the committee can conduct hearings into the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill proposes replacing the medical services committee of inquiry with professional services review  committees, which will assess instances of overservicing where the practitioner involved has not responded to counselling by the Health Insurance Commission's medical advisers. The proposed new system replaces the notion of excessive servicing with a concept of inappropriate practice. This encompasses the existing concepts of excessive rendering and excessive initiating, but also introduces the concept of excessive prescribing. In addition, it will allow a committee to examine, where relevant, aspects of a practitioner's practice broader than purely the excessive servicing of patients. Under this, a committee will have the capacity to consider the conduct of the person under review in his or her practice and determine whether that conduct is acceptable to the general body of his or her profession or specialty. This is objectionable. Conduct may not be acceptable to a majority of the members of a profession or specialty, but it may be a preferred practice of a respectable and reputable minority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for the professional services review committee to apply the findings from a statistically valid sample of services rendered or initiated by the practitioner under review to the whole class of services which are of concern. This new statistical sampling method will infer the level of inappropriate practice in a class of Medicare services from a random sample of services drawn from that class. This is suspect for the sorts of reasons given by the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), but it is worse. It may result in a penalty being imposed for an offence which did not occur. At best, it would be a penalty for an offence which might have occurred on the basis of a statistical sample taken on a random basis and applied generally. That is not, in my opinion, an appropriate way of disciplining a professional person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The professional services review committee is constituted from a professional services review panel, which will represent a wide range of professions and specialty groups within a profession. The bill also establishes the position of a director of professional services review. Under the scheme proposed by the bill, the commission can refer to the director the conduct of the person who is engaged in inappropriate practice in connection with the rendering or initiation of services. The commission must send a copy of the referral to the person under review within 48 hours. Within 28 days after receipt of the referral, the director must either dismiss it or set up a professional services review committee to consider whether the practitioner has engaged in inappropriate practice. The director, in reaching a decision on the referral, may consult a member of the professional services review panel or any consultant or learned professional body that the director may consider appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the person under review is a practitioner, the director and the practitioner may enter into a written agreement under which the practitioner agrees to partial disqualification, which means disqualification for up to 12 months in respect of the provision of particular services, the provision of services to particular persons or classes of persons, or the provision of services within or without a specified location. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This provision is of particular concern as it raises the possibility, prior to an inquiry being made into the matter under consideration or any allegation being proved, of pressure being brought to bear, under statutory authority, on a practitioner to agree to a disqualification. In effect, this provision may compel a professional to engage in plea bargaining to avoid the expense of an inquiry. This would be contrary not only to the interests of the practitioner, but also to the interests of the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept it may also be contrary to the public interest for another reason. Conceivably, a practitioner may be aware that matters will be discovered during the inquiry which could result in his or her total disqualification or the imposition of a significant monetary penalty. The opportunity to do a deal with the director to avoid such an inquiry would, therefore, defeat the purpose of the entire review procedure&mdash;albeit there would be a temporary respite. If the director elects to establish a committee, the committee must convene within 14 days after the appointment of its members. The committee may regulate proceedings as it thinks fit, but the meeting must be held in private. The committee may, for the purposes of its inquiry into a matter that is the subject of a referral, inform itself in any manner it thinks fit. It is not, therefore, bound by the formal rules of evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After considering a referral, if it appears to the committee that the person under review may have engaged in an inappropriate practice in connection with rendering or initiating the referred service, the committee must hold a hearing at which evidence is given and documents are produced. The person under review must be given at least 14 days notice of the time and place of the hearing. The person under review is entitled to attend the hearing and to be accompanied by a lawyer or another adviser, but is not entitled to be represented at the hearing by a lawyer or other adviser. The person under review may question any person giving evidence at the hearing and may address the committee. The committee may allow an adviser, but not a lawyer, to question a person giving evidence at the hearing and to address the committee on behalf of the person under review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As described earlier, natural justice may include a right to legal or lay representation, depending upon all the circumstances of the particular case. Given that the potential outcome of the hearing may be a finding of overservicing, which may result in disqualification for the practitioner and thus immediate emotional, social and financial impacts, natural justice demands, I suggest, that a person be allowed legal representation, in the full sense, in such hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the person under review is required by the committee to give evidence or produce documents at the hearing and fails on two occasions to comply with those requirements, the committee may proceed with the hearing in the absence of the person under review. That seems fair. If the person under review is a practitioner, the bill requires the director to be notified of the failure to comply and the director is then required to disqualify fully the person under review. This also applies if the person under review fails to answer a question put to him or her by the committee in the course of his or her evidence, unless the answer is one that might tend to incriminate him or her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are draconian provisions. Certainly, it may in some cases be appropriate that there be a penalty attached to a practitioner failing to comply with the requirements of the act. However, there is a multitude of reasons why a practitioner may not receive notices requiring him or her to attend a hearing or to produce documents. A monetary penalty imposed is easily reversed and would not have long-term ramifications for the practitioner. If the person under review subsequently complies with the requirements of the committee, the director must be informed and the director must then revoke the disqualification. However, a disqualification, no matter how brief, could have an irreversible adverse impact on the reputation and the livelihood of the practitioner involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has the right to include in its findings that overservicing has occurred beyond the cases specifically examined by the committee. This is extraordinary in a penalty proceeding. The committee's findings are to be forwarded to a determining officer, who will prepare a draft determination on the basis of the findings and the remedies available in the legislation. The draft determination must be given to the person under review, and that person then has 14 days to make written submissions suggesting changes to the draft determination. The determining officer then makes a final determination.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The determining officer did not hear the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions do not meet the requirements of natural justice with respect to either the prosecution guilt-finding phase or the prosecution penalty phase. As I mentioned previously, natural justice principles would apply to not only the inquisitorial phase and the guilt finding phase, but also the penalty determining phase. With respect to the penalty phase, the affected party does not have the opportunity to make submissions prior to the making of a draft determination. The onus is placed on the party under review to overturn the draft determination, rather than a determination being based on the submissions of both the committee and the party under review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill fudges the distinction between a prosecution on the one hand and an inquiry or investigation on the other hand. A review turns into a prosecution without the subject ever having been advised of that transformation or of the particular charge against the person being identified to him at the relevant time. That makes a mockery of the government's assertion that the proposed legislation meets the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not mentioned it particularly, but I am also concerned that the proceedings before the committee are to be in private; they are confidential. It is accepted that the personal affairs of patients should not be made public. However, there are ways and means, regularly engaged in in courts on a daily basis, of keeping out of the public gaze the affairs of particular persons innocently involved in other people's proceedings. The confidential nature of the proceeding may be appropriate for an investigation. I suggest that it is entirely inappropriate for a prosecution in which the public has an interest in ensuring that justice is done from both points of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the justifications the government has given for this bill is that it is supported by the medical profession and specifically the AMA. My response to this is threefold: first, I query whether the AMA has in fact been properly advised as to the operation of this proposed legislation; secondly, I question whether the general bodies of the professions impacted upon by this legislation are aware of the ramifications of the proposed review procedures; and, finally, even if I am wrong on both those counts, even if all the parties directly affected by this bill support it, I still oppose it as setting a dangerous precedent for legislation dealing with administrative disciplinary procedures for persons who are not directly affected by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles of natural justice and procedural fairness set down by the courts have been developed over time in order to ensure that proceedings are conducted in a fair and just manner. While the parliament is not bound by those principles, they nonetheless provide a guide to legislators as to how proceedings should be conducted. The fact that some of these principles have been compromised or simply flouted in this bill means that practitioners under review for overservicing will be denied rights accorded to members of other professional bodies in similar disciplinary proceedings. It is accepted that the question of overservicing is an important one that must be addressed, but this bill needs substantial revision to be acceptable. In the review, the distinction between investigation and disciplinary proceedings must be recognised and must be observed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to speak on the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill 1993. This bill is a step forward in the monitoring of the provision of health services in this country. For too long the relationship between the Australian Medical Association and the government has been hostile and confrontationist, and this issue of overservicing and inappropriate practices has long been a bone of contention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember during the election campaign fronting up to my local AMA meeting to put forward the Labor Party health program and priorities and to listen to the Liberal candidate's views. To say the night was rather daunting would be an understatement, but I did come away with the impression that a dialogue between the Labor Party and the AMA could take place in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Australians, it seems, are sick and tired of seeing a continual brawling between both parties, the government and the AMA, rather than a focus on what the public sees as the many health issues facing the nation. I will mention these, and they are not listed in any priority: the lack of doctors in many country areas in Australia; the need to grapple with the problems of the mentally ill in our society and the impact of deinstitutionalisation&mdash;this aspect of the health debate is now finally out in the open through the new Burdekin report; the serious health problems facing the long-term unemployed in our country; the urgent need to address the many health problems facing our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders; the need to address the long waiting lists in many of our hospitals; and, finally, the need to ensure a totally effective national immunisation policy to ensure that all our children are covered against the many diseases prevalent in the world today. There is now an acceptance by the vast majority of Australians that our health system will continue to be based on the principles of Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I would like to place on the record my admiration for the President of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Brendan Nelson, and his work in establishing a proper dialogue between his association and the government. I welcome the views he expressed at the National Press Club on 29 September of this year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the election there has been a change. Graham Richardson recognises, as I do, that the majority of middle Australians out there want its doctors working with their elected government, whatever its political colour, on the solutions to our substantial problems.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Health policies must be presented honestly, the rhetoric and conflict between doctors and politicians has to be put to one side in the interests, especially, of the sick and the poor. We are all tired of knee-jerk, ideological responses from people on both sides of politics to solutions that any sensible person can see are needed.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill gives effect to an undertaking given in the budget to introduce new measures to combat overservicing in the Medicare program, including pharmaceutical benefits. It is pleasing to note that the amendments to the Health Insurance Act outlined in this bill reflect the outcome of a close consultative process with the Australian Medical Association. The AMA has played a vital role in the development of the new measures. In so doing, it has shown that it is serious in its belief that public resources earmarked for the provision of health care services to all Australians are properly and effectively utilised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This bill proposes new arrangements for determining whether individual health practitioners have engaged in certain inappropriate professional practices. The new measures in this bill are necessary because, unfortunately, the current mechanisms for effectively dealing with overservicing have not proved to be successful. The strengthened and far more effective review process in this legislation should not concern the vast majority of medical practitioners throughout Australia. They are doing an excellent job in the provision of health services to all Australians throughout the country. However, we are sending a warning shot to those practitioners who are misusing or deliberately abusing the current benefits arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides for the making of findings on the extent of a practitioner's rendering or initiating of inappropriate services on the basis of sampling techniques endorsed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This review process is not to be invoked lightly. It is the government's intention that no practitioner will be subjected to the review process until he or she has been seen by a medical adviser of the Health Insurance Commission. The medical practitioner is to be advised of the commission's concerns regarding the practitioner's practice and given the opportunity to consider his or her position. This could include seeking the advice of professional colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only if the practitioner's practice continues to cause concern will he or she be referred for review. The review scheme will be independent of the Health Insurance Commission and be managed by a director of the professional services review who will have the power to empanel the professional services review committee to consider the practitioner's conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Membership of the committee will consist of practitioners in the same profession or, if that profession is medicine, in the same general discipline as the practitioner under review. The operation and proceedings of the committees are designed to facilitate the prompt determination of referrals of inappropriate professional practice with a minimum of formality and an absence of legal technicality. I do not share the concerns of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), about the lack of legal representation. I think that some of the emotive language he used when discussing the inquisitorial nature of this is not well founded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed that the committees be empowered to make certain findings based on statistical sampling. The proceedings of the committees are regulated in much the same way as those of the committees they will replace. However, more detailed provision is to be made in respect of persons who fail to cooperate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Committee findings adverse to persons under review are to be reported to a determining officer who, it is proposed, will be appointed by the minister. The role of the determining officer is to be that of making determinations on those findings. These determinations range from reprimand, counselling, repaying certain benefits to the Commonwealth, paying a penalty equal to any benefits paid, to being partially or completely disqualified from the Medicare system. Through these provisions, it is intended to protect Commonwealth revenues from the consequences of inappropriate professional practices. It is interesting at this point to note the thoughts on these proposed changes as given by Dr Brendan Nelson in this month's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Medicine</EMPHASIS>. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMA's involvement in this is driven by what I see as our obligations as a professional association to be just that&mdash;to provide a proper peer review mechanism for doctors who are accused by the HIC of providing unnecessary medical services.</PARA>
<PARA>He further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new mechanism developed by the AMA ensures that proper peer review does occur and that natural justice is achieved for the doctor concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>I think this allays some of the fears of the previous speaker. </PARA>
<PARA>He further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must also be said that although overservicing is difficult, if not impossible to define, it is a bit like pornography&mdash;you can't define it, but you know it when you see it!</PARA>
<PARA>It is pleasing to note the views of the opposition and its basic general support for these amendments; for, as I said earlier, we must all work collectively in order to ensure that all Australians are receiving the most comprehensive, qualitative and effective health programs possible. I totally support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate on the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill 1993 has been one in which honourable members on both sides of the House have, in their own unique ways, contributed to its passage through the House. I listened with interest to the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth). I was sitting in my office during contributions by her and other members. That is the wonderful thing about closed circuit television. We can be quietly working away in our offices, being part of the debate without being in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some interesting aspects were raised in this debate. The reality is&mdash;and I think we all accept this&mdash;that there are major problems in the delivery of health care in Australia today. It is no secret that we have the highest rate of drug prescription per capita in the world. More people in Australia are addicted to legally prescribed drugs than those who are addicted to illegal drugs. Hence, valium, serepax, tryptanol, rohypnol and a whole host of other drugs are prescribed well over and above the appropriate medication need. The evidence is unarguable that this is the problem; so much so that we now know that over five per cent of public hospital beds in Australia are occupied by people admitted because of poly-drug abuse of legally prescribed drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem goes far beyond that in the illegal drug market, on which we spend millions of dollars. We do not concentrate as much on the legal prescription side of drugs and the problems it creates as we do on the illegal side. We know also, for example, that we have more appendicectomies and caesarean sections performed in this country per capita than in any other country in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have more surgical intervention across the board in this country than in any other country in the world. In fact, evidence has shown very clearly that there are more healthy appendixes removed in this country than there are unhealthy ones. One must wonder what sort of a profession we have in this country when, very largely from the public purse, overservicing is occurring to the extent that it is. This is a major problem not just for the Commonwealth, but also for the states. After all, it is the states which are responsible for the provision of public hospital care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know, of course, that in Victoria hospital funding is being cut dramatically. As an aside, today I received by fax newspaper cuttings from my electorate about one hospital in the town of Heathcote which looks like it will have to close its kitchen and reduce its staff by an enormous number to the extent that the hospital may be forced to close. That is not a problem appropriate for this House, but it is a major problem for Victoria. Indeed, we know we have distinct and uniquely Australian problems in the delivery of health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with a great deal of interest to the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). He is indeed a distinguished lawyer; a person whom one would listen to with respect and with whose views one would not lightly disagree. But there are several things I should say to the honourable gentleman. It is a pity he is not in the chamber. Firstly, the proceedings of the proposed tribunal have not been changed substantially. They are the same proceedings that have been in place in the original legislation for some time. There is to be no major or substantive change in the proceedings as a result of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other fact the honourable gentleman probably does not know, but which is a reality, is that the changes that are taking place with this legislation have eventuated after consultation with the profession. There is nothing in this legislation which is not known to the profession. Perhaps, more importantly, the changes have taken place as a result of suggestions from the profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I do not think it is quite fair for the honourable gentleman to say, as he did, that there will be grave concerns. I think I quote him correctly as saying that he had doubts as to whether members of the profession were aware of the concerns he expressed about the changes and the effects of those changes. I have to inform the House that that is not correct&mdash;in fact, the profession is aware of them. The profession has operated under these procedures for some time now, and the bill before the House is the result of suggestions for change from the profession. I must confess again, after listening to the honourable gentleman, that I did in fact go through&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! The honourable member for McEwen might resume his seat. I again draw the attention of the honourable member for Calwell to standing order 57 and invite him to observe it. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KF4">Mr CLEELAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did check with the bill. Having sat as a part-time legal member on an administrative tribunal in 1991 and 1992 and having had some experience, both legally and as a member of one of the administrative tribunals, I suppose it is fairly common to find in most Commonwealth legislation a clause or a proposed section which directs a tribunal to apply what can be loosely called `natural justice' or rules which create fairness in the procedural activities of a tribunal. I must confess that I do not find that in the amendment bill. Of course, I do not know whether the principal act has such a provision in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I note that this bill requires the committee to establish its own proceedings and its own rules of meeting. Indeed, it would be most unusual for any tribunal of this nature, in establishing its proceedings, not to have an understanding of the administrative law requirement to have a procedure which would recognise what are loosely called the rules of natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who sit on these tribunals have professional staff, registrars and other people, to guide them. Not for love nor money could I imagine the professional people who would be part of this committee not setting forth procedural arrangements for the hearings in the early stages which would take into account those requirements which are known in loose terms as the requirements of natural justice, procedural observance or other such language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point is that if this committee did act in a way which was capricious or contrary to administrative law principles, the right of appeal would come into effect immediately. Any aggrieved person appearing before this committee would have the right to go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court. On such occasions, those breaches would be remedied and the tribunal would undoubtedly be directed by the AAT or the Federal Court to get its act together. If its procedures were found to be deficient, they would be changed to fall within the general requirements as recognised by administrative law in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having listened to the honourable gentleman, having thought about the matter and having turned to my own knowledge of the way these tribunals operate, I do not share his concerns in the way they were expressed. This House should not be concerned, because as I have explained&mdash;and as I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, will explain&mdash;this is indeed in accordance with what the profession requires and seeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) also raised concerns about what he described as a rash of legal claims against obstetricians in this country. I have some knowledge of this problem from local obstetricians in my electorate. It is one of the oddities of medical practice in this country that, despite the fact that we have more medical practitioners per head of population than almost any other country in the world, we cannot get doctors in rural areas. There is an enormous shortage of medical practitioners outside Australia's major urban centres. It is one of the real quirks of the medical profession&mdash;and it applies to lawyers too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professionals, it seems, will not leave the comfort of urban areas and travel outside their comfortable practices to assist those in rural areas who really deserve the same sorts of services as city people. Several medical practitioners in my electorate&mdash;I think of Dr Joan Curtis at Mansfield, for example&mdash;have contacted me expressing their great concern about the increased number of legal actions being taken against medical practitioners, particularly those involved in obstetrics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bothered to do a bit of research through the library and I have made other inquiries about the problems that Dr Curtis and other obstetricians are observing. I have also had chats with Dr Colin Officer, a practitioner in Seymour, about the problems. There seems to be no doubt at all that the number of legal proceedings is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, there is a risk with all births. The fact is that a baby goes through a birth canal and there can be associated trauma. In all births we know that there will be a percentage of babies born with defects. Yet today it is clear that an increasing number of parents who have a child who does not meet their expectations are bringing actions against the obstetrician for legal damages, saying, `There must be some problem that you caused, because my baby is not what I expected. My child has a medical problem as a result of the birth'. The evidence I have received from Dr Officer and Dr Joan Curtis is that almost one-third of the fees they charge goes toward insurance. That is increasing at an alarming rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must not forget that many obstetricians, particularly in rural areas, are general practitioners. We do not find city specialists going to towns like Seymour, Woods Point, Euroa and the central parts of Victoria. Heavens to Betsy, we are a settled state and we have trouble getting doctors in rural towns. What in blazes happens in outback New South Wales or the rest of truly rural Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My contacts in my electorate tell me that, if insurance costs keep increasing, GPs in rural areas will not practise  obstetrics. It is a major and increasing problem. In fact, I have written to the relevant minister about this. I know a review is currently being undertaken regarding a national insurance system or some other program whereby some pressure could be taken off obstetricians. As I have said, rural people deserve, and are entitled to expect, the same medical services as city people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ophthalmology services have now been stopped in Shepparton hospital, which is a dreadful tragedy for Victoria. As a result of case mix funding, Shepparton base hospital has now said, `No more eye surgery, no more ophthalmology; down to Melbourne you go'. Rural people will again be denied the same medical services and treatment that I have already discussed in this House. I find it an absolute disgrace that people are being put under these pressures in rural towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the general things said by almost all honourable members who have spoken in this debate. All of us in this House know of the dreadful problems and difficulties that have to be faced. The sad truth is&mdash;we cannot deny it&mdash;that for every 100 honest professionals there are two or three pretty rotten ones. That applies to my profession; it applies across the board. Some of these pretty rotten ones can cost taxpayers&mdash;the ordinary, decent people out there who pay taxes so that the government can pay Medicare rebates and so forth&mdash;a hell of a lot of money. From reading the newspapers, I know that some pretty frightening cases have come up only recently where medical practitioners have been charged with quite gross and quite evil acts against the Commonwealth and the system. I think it is proper that we introduce procedures to encourage detection of those who overservice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out earlier, sometimes it is not necessarily a problem of criminal activity. As the most overprescribed and most surgically overserviced country in the world, we really need to start educating our doctors&mdash;our medical practitioners&mdash;about other ways to deliver services. This bill provides for counselling. One of the more positive things about this bill is that, rather than necessarily get medical practitioners down, beat them about the head, fine them lots of money and kick them out, it provides that some of those people who may be overprescribing valium, rohypnol&mdash;rollies&mdash;and so on be brought in, counselled, maybe cautioned by being told in no uncertain terms that it is not acceptable and directed on the right path again in the medical practice. This will make them far better medical practitioners at a more effective cost to us than the other ways in which the matter has been handled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) is anxious to move along. I have said what I particularly wanted to say, and I do not want to unnecessarily prolong this debate. I support the bill and I urge the House not to be overly concerned by the honourable member for Tangney. I think he was very deliberate in what he said. As I said, I listened to him carefully and I respect his opinions, but I support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all honourable members will recognise that this is very important legislation in that it will reform, in quite a dramatic way, overservicing. It is hoped that the levels of overservicing will be reduced, that taxpayers will save significant amounts in terms of Medicare and that health costs will be kept down. That is the aim of this legislation. The new system is not primarily directed towards punishment or towards collecting penalties or fines. It is directed towards encouraging correct practice so that medical practitioners will cease or at least reduce overservicing, therefore saving taxpayers and the medical system.</PARA>

I remember when I was first elected the Joint Committee of Public Accounts initiating a massive inquiry in 1981 or 1982 into medical fraud and overservicing. That was quite a controversial inquiry. In fact, a lot of material came out of it. At that time we were in opposition. Initially, people said that there was no overservicing, but it soon emerged that there was a significant amount of overservicing and, indeed, fraud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Berowra is getting ahead of me here; I was about to explain what has happened. Following that inquiry, after being elected to government we adopted some of the committee's recommendations and established the so-called medical services committees of inquiry that were required to deal with these issues of overservicing and fraud. The initial impact of the publicity about medifraud during that period after the establishment of these committees and the period which followed caused significant inroads to be made into the problems of overservicing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although inroads were made, as is the wont, certain people discovered ways and means of getting around being put before these committees. The committee processes became dragged out and lengthy. Each and every case of overservicing had to be established as a separate incident. It suited some practitioners to ignore instructions to change their practices and simply pay fines where it was established that they had been involved in some overservicing. The result was that the system started to break down. The intention of the system&mdash;namely, to change the practice of medical practitioners&mdash;was certainly less and less fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has recently decided to reform the system in such a way as to try to focus on the practices of medical practitioners so that they will change them. The government wants practitioners to have in mind the fact that, in our system of health care, it is primarily the taxpayers, through the whole system, who have to pay for medical care. It is not as though they are able to do whatever they like, irrespective of cost and irrespective of overservicing. We have tried to make this point in a number of ways. Unfortunately, as I said, the old system was starting to break down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have brought in a new system. The extraordinary and very positive thing about the new system is that the basic structure has been recommended by the profession. The AMA, especially under its new president, has been very keen to come to an accommodation with the government over these issues. The structure of the system is very fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally reject the thrust of the comments made by the honourable member for Tangney. If his views were representative of the views of the whole of the opposition, the opposition might not have moved amendments or opposed the bill outright. I do not believe that his views represent the views of the real thinkers in the opposition. They know that we have to do something about this problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not saying that he is not entitled to say whatever he likes; I am saying that I do not think his views would be shared by an overwhelming number of members of this chamber. He used expressions such as `star chamber process', `denial of natural justice', `contradicting principles of natural justice', `draconian provisions', and other rather emotive expressions. I was here for the whole of his speech. I have to say that is a very unfair representation of the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a couple of points about the process. Most importantly, it should be remembered that this is a system of peer review; medical peers are going to make a judgment as to whether there is overservicing. The honourable member for Tangney said that the practitioner will have the opportunity in the first instance of consultation and discussion with the director. So, if he is prepared to amend and change the pattern of his overservicing or the pattern of his medical practice, the matter might end there; no fines or penalties would be involved. But if he persists or if he decides that he wants to continue with that form of practice, then he would be entitled to a hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obligatory within 90 days of a hearing that a finding be made by members of the review panel. The finding would then be sent to a determining officer of the department, who would then make a determination. He could suggest that the practitioner be spoken to, that a fine be imposed, or that the practitioner not continue to receive Medicare benefits for a certain period. That would apply to particular groups of practitioners or a particular group of people. There is a whole range of possibilities. In the event that he is dissatisfied with the determination, he has 28 days to appeal to a tribunal. The tribunal will then make the final determination. After that, if there is any point of law, he can take it to the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member for Tangney is concerned about issues of natural justice, given all the checks in this system, any such issue that may arise can be dealt with. If it is not dealt with, there is the possibility of a final appeal to the Federal Court. I reject the allegations made by the honourable member for Tangney about this system. It is interesting that he seemed to have a great sympathy for a professional person having to explain his behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say this about professional bodies and professional persons: professional persons are given a very big responsibility in our community, especially medical practitioners. They are looked up to and should behave in a particular way and meet certain standards. If they abuse those requirements, then it is quite correct that a judgment should be made&mdash;not by you or me, Mr Deputy Speaker, as laymen, but by their peers, who may make a judgment that they have engaged in an activity which is quite wrong from the point of view of justifiable practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Tangney was against the idea of a sample. He said that he felt it would be unjust to make a judgment against somebody on the basis of a sample. Let us look at the general structure of the system. I want to make this point because it is important. In the event that a medical practitioner feels that he does not want to go on the basis of a sample of, say, 50 out of the 500 or 60 out of the 500, he will be in a position, if he so desires, to ask members of the panel to survey every case. If they found massive overservicing&mdash;let us say it was an extreme case and they found that 150 out of the 500 had constituted overservicing&mdash;then they would be in a position to fine him for the whole number of those cases. On the other hand, if he went on the basis of the sample, then it is up to the determining officer to determine whether the offence is going to be expanded to the totality of the cases or limited to a certain proportion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be up to the practitioner to make a determination of that kind if he feels that the sample procedure has something that does not benefit him. If somebody has been deliberately and wilfully overservicing, it would be most unlikely that he would want the panel to go through all 500 cases. He would be more likely to take his chances with the survey on the basis that he can argue for the minimum position with respect to the survey. Nevertheless, that option will be available to him if he feels that the other procedure is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by saying something about the way in which this system will work in relation to the fraud issue. In the past, whenever members of the medical services committees of inquiry have detected a case which appears to be not overservicing but which involves fraud&mdash;that is to say, a case where there was no such person or where no such service was given, which is fraud&mdash;they have said, `That is no longer our concern', and the case has been sent back to the Health Insurance Commission. The matter has then been reconsidered, usually with the help of the Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a difficulty in that whatever was detected at the MSCI hearings that might have been relevant and helpful in building the case for fraud was not given either to the Health Insurance Commission or to the Federal Police. The situation now will be different. If members of the committee feel that this is no longer a case of overservicing but a case of fraud, they will be able to refer the matter again as before. But now they will be in a position where they will be able to provide explanations and evidence&mdash;to the extent that they have such explanations and evidence&mdash;that it is a case of fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this scheme there is a whole range of very positive possibilities. I believe we will exceed the savings which were mentioned in the budget. It is an excellent new scheme and one must be very thankful to the AMA for its participation. One point that came up in the debate which needs clarification is that the penalties which are imposed in these matters are either fines or suspension from Medicare benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will not provide the power to disqualify a medical practitioner. It is concerned primarily with the Commonwealth giving benefits through the Medicare structure. If medical practitioners are abusing the Medicare structure and getting excessive benefits incorrectly, fines can be imposed and those people can be withdrawn from the</PARA>
<PARA>Medicare structure. But they cannot be struck off as medical practitioners; that is a matter that only state medical boards can determine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this legislation to the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill that we are debating tonight are related. They have a very simple purpose: to put in place the regime that is designed to ensure that people who are trading in nursing homes, in particular, are able to do so and obtain a clear title&mdash;that is, clear of charges. So the complex set of arrangements which were initiated in the National Health Amendment Act 1992, and which made unspent nursing home benefits a recoverable debt upon the sale of a nursing home, have some implications on this matter. Previously, such overpaid benefits could only be clawed back by imposing a negative loading on the new proprietor. So people who were acquiring a nursing home were in prospect of acquiring substantial debts which they might not otherwise be aware of. The 1992 changes were effective prospectively, applying only to overpayments in relation to benefits paid after the commencement date of these amendments on 1 July 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) amends the National Health Act 1953 to provide for the collection and recovery of unspent benefits in respect of a period prior to 1 July 1993. The amount of these unspent benefits will be assessed by the secretary and recovered as a nursing home charge levied on the vendor in the same way as post-30 June 1993 overpayments are now recovered as a result of last year's amendments. The proposed amendments further protect the rights of purchasers, enabling them to purchase nursing homes unencumbered by debts incurred by previous owners. In that sense, it is a very worthy, appropriate and proper objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the nursing home charge is strictly a tax&mdash;and we are all very familiar with these distinctions these days&mdash;the Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill 1993 enables the tax to be levied on the proprietor responsible for the debt at the time of the sale. There are certain complexities in relation to the start-up date of this legislation which I will not go into. We are told that the financial impact is somewhat limited, in the sense that the Bill has no direct financial impact upon the revenue of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) introduces a new division 2A into the National Health Act imposing a nursing home charge. Under this proposed division, if an investigation upon the sale or proposed sale of a nursing home finds that a fee-reducing unspent benefit was paid to a proprietor prior to 1 July 1993, the secretary may give notice in writing to the vendor of the amount of that benefit. The notified amount is the nursing home charge and the vendor is liable for that charge. The notice must stipulate the amount of the charge and the date that it is payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secretary may amend an assessment within three years of it being made. An amended assessment may be made at the initiative of the secretary or by application by the charge payer. If the amendment results in a reduction in the charge, the amount of that reduction is taken to have never been payable. A liable person has 42 days to lodge an objection with the minister in regard to an assessment. The minister must consider an objection and reject it or allow it in full or in part. An objection decision may be reviewed under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed division 2 refers to the collection and recovery of the nursing home charge. The secretary may extend the time for payment; however, a 16 per cent per annum late payment charge applies. The secretary may remit some or all of the penalty in special or mitigating circumstances. The charge is recoverable as a debt through the courts. There are special provisions for the recovery of a charge from persons with joint liability, from trustees of deceased estates and from unadministered estates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed division 3 allows for the collection of the charge before completion of a sale of a nursing home, either from the vendor, the purchaser, or both. Advance payments can occur if there is a likelihood that an assessment will reveal a vendor's liability or an assessment has actually revealed such a liability. If the appropriate notice of a sale has been given, an advance payment direction can occur only upon the completion of an investigation; is limited to the purchaser; and is considered as a consideration in the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If an investigation is ordered due to a lack of notice of sale, an advance payment direction may result of an estimate of the fee-reducing benefit and may also include the payment of any difference between the estimated amount and the purchase price to the vendor. Any advance payments made as a result of the estimates are held in trust and interest may be payable if they exceed the sum of the fee-reducing benefit and any post-30 June 1993 overpayments. The bill allows the secretary to take account of unpaid nursing home charges when setting a charge of fees and to reduce the fee that the proprietor can charge accordingly. If an outstanding charge is paid, a new scale of fees which reflects any underpaid general care benefits to the proprietor must then be determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to subsection 65H and 65J allow the secretary to direct that pre-1 July 1993 nursing home charges and post-30 June overpayments be paid by nursing home purchasers when no advance payments have been determined. These amendments also allow the secretary to direct post-30 June 1993 overpayments to be paid to purchasers when an advance payment has been directed. The schedule to the bill replaces all references in the principal act to the previous fee determining benefit with the new fee increasing benefit. The separate, but connected, Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill enables the nursing home charge to be levied on the liabilities that are determined by the secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate in the 1992 budget session in relation to the National Health Amendment Act 1992, the coalition pointed out that the nursing home industry was in support of an extension of the overpayment provisions to include unspent funding prior to the 1 July commencement date of the act. This bill, however, is designed to accommodate concerns that the industry noted at that time. It will provide further protection to purchasers of nursing homes by making the vendor liable for unspent Commonwealth funding, both before and after 1 July 1993. It will also enable a more timely recovery of Commonwealth moneys than the current negative loading system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, it would be appreciated that the coalition does not oppose these two interconnected bills, which we see as facilitating the arrangements and protecting bona fide purchasers. In fact, we would like it to be noted that the coalition was the first to put on record the nursing home industry's concerns about the inadequacy of the post-June 1993 amendments that were contained in the previous amendments that I have noted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The determinations of the nursing home charge emanate from validations of the nursing home funding by the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services. Significant concerns have been expressed about the department's administration of its validations program, and they have been expressed by both the voluntary and private sectors of the nursing home industry. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and to ascertain whether a further inquiry is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA>It is in this context that we in the opposition stress that the relevance of the validations process to the successful implementation of these measures is of the utmost importance, and we see the inquiry that we have initiated as an important factor in relation to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns that have been expressed by proprietors of nursing homes and their representatives about the conduct of validations seem to have been many and varied. Some of the more commonly expressed concerns include: first, the department validating nursing and personal care expenditure from before the commencement of the new CAM and SAM system in 1987; second, the purchasers of new nursing homes not being informed about negative loadings that are pending on nursing homes when they have inquired with the department&mdash;inquiries are proper matters that people, particularly when they are properly advised, ought to be able to undertake, and the expectation ought to be that they receive accurate information in relation to those matters, particularly when they are important questions to be resolved at the time of purchase; third, widely differing interpretations between departmental officers as to what constitutes nursing and personal care expenditure; and, fourth, the issuing of departmental circulars that amend the definition of nursing and personal care, and then applying these new interpretations retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth matter is the significant miscalculations of negative loadings by validation teams; sixth, the excessive tardiness by the department in validating nursing homes that are changing hands; seventh, the excessively onerous requests by departmental officers for records and proof of expenditure for many years earlier, including when a nursing home may have been under different ownership&mdash;of course, that is a matter that presents some difficulties at times; eighth, the fact that undue discretion is given to individual validators in the handbook available for that purpose; and, ninth, the totally unrealistic interpretations of the everyday duties, particularly of directors of nursing, including whether or not it is a nursing duty to take linen from a linen cupboard or to take a resident's nightdress from the bed to the laundry, and instances which my colleague Senator Patterson has drawn attention to in particular. From experience with nursing homes that most of us in this place have had, not necessarily through the circumstance of our own families but very often through our constituents or as a result of many places in our constituencies, I am always amazed that there can be inflexibility in relation to such matters where really the importance is on providing the service and care to the individuals involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tenth matter was that the validation guidelines ignored the fact that tax had already been paid on money that is being recouped; and the eleventh and final matter&mdash;possibly the most disturbing&mdash;was the Australian Federal Police entering nursing homes for what would appear to be questionably valid reasons. These are matters of concern which we believe this inquiry will facilitate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that this is an area in which there has been a good deal of comment. There have been a number of parliamentary inquiries over time, and we have now had further reports, only in this last sitting period, in relation to nursing homes in particular. Professor Gregory, known for his comments in relation to economic matters, has reviewed the structure of the nursing home funding arrangements, and Mrs Macri inquired into resident classification instrument documentation consultancies. Both of those who have reported in this area have had some comments about the aged care system generally, which is very much related to the nursing home questions that this legislation broadly deals with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The findings confirm very much the sorts of comments that my colleague Senator Patterson has been raising. I will note some of these for the purposes of the record. Professor Gregory, for instance, found the inflexible funding system prevents any significant efficiency gains through enterprise bargaining. That is a matter of some concern to us all. One of the further matters he raised was the need to reduce the monitoring of nursing homes that provide a high quality standard of care; in other words, to look at those that perhaps have evidenced, through their past record, a need for more careful monitoring. He also suggested that there was a need for greater industry involvement in the operation of the standard monitoring teams. Obviously a form of peer review is a better way of proceeding than often is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the current funding system is a disincentive to upgrading nursing home stock was another matter about which he commented, a matter that I think needs to be taken on board and needs to be the subject of further consideration and implementation. He noted the excessive administration entailed in the residential classification index and the need to clarify nursing and personal care tasks for validation purposes. Finally, he emphasised the need to examine state variations in infrastructure costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second inquiry raised other matters, but which are equally important, such as fostering a partnership with industry based upon cooperation and mutual respect; the fact that the level of documentation required by the Commonwealth is seen as excessive; that inconsistencies in the application of current documentation requirements are of major concern; and, finally, that documentation requirements have lowered staff morale and caused animosity towards the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This gives the government a great deal of food for thought. These matters suggest that there needs to be a fundamental rethink of the way in which the relationship between the industry and the department are reviewed. We have also had further developments in the area of nursing homes, particularly with the Burdekin report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of the National Inquiry into the Human Rights of People with Mental Illness</EMPHASIS>, which has been presented recently to the government. In particular, recommendations in chapter 17 of the report are a salutary reminder of the special needs of older people with dementia to have support and care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of Commissioner Burdekin's report as well as Professor Gregory's mid-term review, a number of matters need to be taken up, particularly&mdash;as Commissioner Burdekin has said&mdash;the chronic problem of underfunding for people with dementia. He noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some dementia specific aged care facilities are facing such significant recurrent funding shortfalls that there is a real possibility that they may have to shut down.</PARA>
<PARA>I think those sorts of comments are quite alarming. He has further recommended that purpose designed dementia facilities should be supported because they are a more humane and cost-effective way of going about the task than generic hostels. In that sense, nursing home facilities have been, in the main, contracting under the government's policies as it has sought to put more emphasis upon access for people to and raising the level of care within the hostels' facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of integrating people with dementia into mainstream services is another matter of concern. I serve in a private capacity on the board of a hospital in New South Wales which has carried out some nursing home functions in the past. I know that there has been an effort to develop psycho-geriatric services to complement some of the other services for the elderly that are provided in this particular hospital environment. It does require a very different style of operation and a very considerable enhancement of the resources to provide the different form of care from what we are used to providing in less secure facilities such as nursing homes and hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arising out of the Burdekin report are a large number of matters that will have to be clarified. Commissioner Burdekin's call for improved support for home based carers of people with dementia is a further important matter and reflects the need for more flexible and accessible care in this area. I am hoping that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous), with his interest in this area and the conscientious way that he approaches his duties, will be keen to clarify, in the context of this debate and having regard to the comments by Commissioner Burdekin, to what extent the government's policy of integrating older people with dementia into geriatric facilities is directly responsible for what Commissioner Burdekin has noted as a deplorable abuse of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of Commissioner Burdekin's recommendation that purpose designed dementia facilities must be supported as a more humane and cost-effective form of accommodation than generic facilities, will the government move immediately to alleviate the serious funding difficulties faced in a number of facilities? Some that have been drawn to my attention were Strathdon Lodge, Eabrai Lodge and Lefroy Hostel. No doubt the parliamentary secretary would be able to enlighten us about others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, this legislation is not opposed by the opposition; it is supported. But we will be seeking, in the committee stage, to pursue a number of minor amendments. They are amendments of a character that my colleague Senator Patterson moved previously in debate on the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 and are designed to ensure that, in relation to penalty units, the form of notation relates to that in the Crimes Act, in which this matter is more fully defined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, while the system the government is moving to is designed to simplify changes in the way penalties are dealt with, the way it is facilitated at the moment means that, without some additional notation, it would be difficult for those reading this section to know where to look to ascertain where the definition and value of a penalty unit might be found. In the committee stage&mdash;assuming we do not run out of time under the guillotine&mdash;I will seek to move to remedy that matter, I trust with the government's cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the parliamentary secretary whether he is also willing to provide an undertaking that all written advices as to the estimates of determinations will include a clause stating that the determination is an estimate only and advising that the principle `buyer beware' should be adhered to by the purchaser. I am sure that is a matter upon which the parliamentary secretary will be equipped to give such an assurance in the conclusion of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last few weeks there have been some comments about the way in which matters are dealt with in this House. People have sought to characterise the opposition as being destructive and unwilling to offer appropriate support to legislation deserving support. In relation to this bill, nothing could be further from the truth. Our approach has been constructive, positive and supportive of reforms that we thought needed additional modification&mdash;and we have offered constructive advice. The government has taken it up in the bills that are now before the House. We commend it for doing that. We support the bill; and that ought to be noted. This is a constructive opposition that looks at each matter closely and adopts a sensible and appropriate response, given all the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary sniggers a little. Where the government approaches these matters in good faith, the support will be there. But when we see, as we have seen in so many other areas, the electorate not being taken into the government's confidence and being given little idea of the tax changes in store for it&mdash;or the substantial changes in the revenue sought in other areas in which I have responsibility&mdash;of course we properly take a different view. We could not be expected to do otherwise. But we are constructive; we are a positive opposition. We, the opposition, will be seen to be the real contributors and worthy of government in the future. </PARA>

I am also delighted to hear that the opposition will not oppose these bills. Aged care is extremely important and, wherever possible, we should have bipartisan agreement. These issues are very important to me as a member of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs and the caucus committee on community services, and convener of that committee's aged care task force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned to ensure that this important government responsibility maintains its current high priority. Australian society has been ageing rapidly over the last 10 years, and this trend will continue into the next century. There were one million people aged over 65 in 1971. That had increased to two million by 1992. By the end of the third decade of the next century&mdash;only 37 years away&mdash;there will be approximately 5.2 million older Australians. This trend is partly because people are living longer. Average life expectancy of 75 years for women and 68 years for men in 1971 had increased to 80 years for women and 73 years for men in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills are about better management of an important part of the government's aged care services policy. The Labor government has more than doubled its spending on aged care since 1983. In 1983-84, expenditure on aged care was $1 billion. This year's programs total an estimated $2.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was privileged to attend the Aged Care Australia national conference last month. The Reverend Ian Paxton, national president of Aged Care Australia, wrote in his message to national conference delegates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Challenging times are upon us. As aged care service providers we are asked to look at ourselves and ask</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*Where do we want aged care to be in the year 2000?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*What will the care needs be for frail aged in that year?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*What skills will the aged care sector require?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*Who should fund these facilities?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*Where will the money come from?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All these questions should be addressed now so that we are prepared for the future.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with Reverend Paxton's assessment. Discussion was lively over the three days of the conference and many subjects were tackled. There was agreement and disagreement, but in general the delegates to that conference agreed that planning for the future was absolutely essential. Commissioner Brian Burdekin was one of the keynote speakers at that conference. The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has already addressed Mr Burdekin's recent report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human rights and mental illness</EMPHASIS>. Mr Burdekin on that occasion obviously addressed the question of the aged with mental illnesses. He particularly referred to dementia sufferers and to the paucity of purpose-built facilities for those people. I agree that more needs to be done in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a part of the government, and involved as I am in planning for aged care provision, attendance at the conference was a very valuable experience for me. I met a great many people from the community sector who are involved in aged care provision, and I learned a lot. In fact, next month when I am in Adelaide for a standing committee inquiry I will be visiting several centres which are trialing new types of aged care facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, one issue which was widely canvassed at the conference and highlighted for further consideration was dementia care planning. This is also an area which has been given a great deal of attention by the government. The national action plan for dementia care was launched in September 1992 and is currently being implemented. The plan aims to stimulate new ways of delivering dementia care. One example of this plan is the funding this financial year of 39 dementia demonstration projects. These projects are not just about showing others what to do; they are about making others think about what they are doing and how they can do better in their own service. They are also about raising community awareness of dementia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The demonstration projects are in all states and cover a range of needs. Five are services for ethnic groups and 12 are based in rural areas. I recently had discussion with those running one of these projects, which is based just outside my electorate but which covers the area of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Health Amendment Bill and the Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill are a small part of the government's overall aged care strategies. They are indicative of the government's commitment to quality care, accountability of the sector and good management. They are about the best and most efficient use of government funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's commitment goes further than this. The government's aged care programs are subject to continual review. The programs are accountable to the government, to the community and, most importantly, to the aged people for whom they are responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September I received a copy of the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Raising the standard&mdash;resident centred nursing home regulation in Australia</EMPHASIS>, which evaluates the introduction of the outcome standards monitoring program for Commonwealth funded nursing homes. The outcome standards monitoring program focuses on rights to health care, social independence, freedom of choice, privacy, dignity and safety. This report is the result of a four-year consultancy headed by Professor John Braithwaite of the Australian National University. The research involved field work in the United States, England, Japan and Canada, and extensive testing of measurement processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report praised the monitoring program and concluded that it has improved the quality of life for Australian nursing home residents and that it is superior to those of the other countries examined. It achieved better outcomes for residents at only a quarter of the cost of the US system, something I think we can be very proud of. The government is continually evaluating its programs with input from consumers, professional groups and unions. Such evaluations, along with considered, responsive refinement of our programs, are what ensure the continued quality of our aged care services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aged care is more than providing support services for those who can no longer support themselves. Independence, self-esteem and the quality and value of life are important to everyone, particularly as they grow older. This government believes that older people should have every opportunity to remain active and valued members of their community. Planners must take account of our ageing society in the design of urban environments so that older people are not isolated. This involves a range of issues from public transport systems which are responsive to the needs of older people to the provision of affordable housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these issues&mdash;which affect the quality of life of so many elderly Australians, not just those requiring care&mdash;fall into other policy areas. Just a few of the policy areas which are relevant to ensuring adequate care of older Australians are health, public housing, urban and regional development&mdash;including public and private transport and other infrastructure provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to providing care for the aged in nursing homes, the government is keen to see people remaining in the community in their own homes for as long as possible. The home and community care program, HACC, has been active over the last few years in providing services for those people. Another part of the provision of services in the home is the community aged care package. The number of community aged care packages will increase from five per 1,000 people aged 70 or more to 7.5 per 1,000 through this year's budget. This will be done through an equal reduction in new hostel places. There will be no change in nursing home allocations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This initiative addresses the increased demand for care packages, improves the choice of services available to older Australians and reduces the need for entry to residential care. In addition, the government will provide $1.3 million for establishing establishment grants of new community aged care packages in 1993, rising to $3.4 million in 1996-97. These grants will be directed to areas where there are limited resources and infrastructure to support community care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly important to establish community care where residential facilities are not viable or are inappropriate. It is also relevant to provide that kind of care for people who have no desire to go into a nursing home. Recently I had the privilege of visiting a day care centre for aged people who are in receipt of aged care packages and other HACC services in my electorate. They were vehement about their need to stay in their own homes for as long as possible, and they hoped they would never have to go into a nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill relates to nursing homes, which are an important part of the government's aged care reform strategy that is based on achieving a balance between residential and community care. The government is committed to providing quality and affordable residential care that respects the rights and dignity of the aged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already spoken of the standards monitoring of nursing homes. In the budget the government has made provision for a further $6 million over two years for the replacement of some 160 nursing home and hostel beds in the non-profit sector. In the private sector a one-year package of approvals to be funded over 10 years, costing $12 million, will assist the proprietors of private nursing homes to upgrade old homes or for new construction. This assistance will take the form of a partial interest rate subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate there are 15 nursing homes which receive Commonwealth funding. They cater for 580 clients and have received over $34 million in funding over the last two financial years. I have not as yet had the opportunity to visit all of the nursing homes in my electorate, but those I have seen provide wonderful services and caring environments for their clients. As a part of the ongoing evaluation of provision of services to which I have already referred, the government is currently undertaking the review of the structure of nursing home funding. The review will examine options to promote the replenishment of nursing home stock, for both the non-profit and private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I commend the government on its commitment to aged care as a high priority policy area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am moved to speak on the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) to highlight the importance of care required within our community for those Australians wishing nursing home care. Too often we assign those Australians needing care to the forgotten area of health care where basic human rights are sometimes ignored and neglected. For far too long we have heard the trumpeting and bleating of successful Labor governments about their supposed excellent work in this field of social welfare when in fact this is really a myth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with interest to the speech of the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) and to the compassionate things she had to say. I believe what she has said, but the compassion and rhetoric are not backed up by any action of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great Australian myth that is becoming folklore in our community is that members of the Labor Party care about individuals, but this is constantly debunked by the ever increasing evidence of their democratic socialistic doctrine of supporting the collective ahead of the individual. But on this occasion it seems a rarity that the government is following the coalition recommendation and acting responsibly. Acting responsibly is rare for the government; however, it should be commended on this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation comes at a most opportune time, given the recent reports into the provision of aged care. Those reports&mdash;the report by Professor Gregory on the review of the structure of nursing home funding arrangements, and the report by Sue Marci on the resident classification instrument documentation consultation for the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services&mdash;highlight a policy vacuum in the area of adequate and effective aged care by this Labor government&mdash;dare I say, a lack of responsibility. Those reports highlight the urgency with which major changes need to be made in the area of aged care if Australia is to effectively meet the demands of an ever ageing population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will seek to improve the collection of moneys owed to the government by nursing homes through overpayments made to them by the Commonwealth. This will be achieved by imposing a charge on the vendor of a nursing home on sale, equivalent to the amount of any outstanding benefit unspent. I point out to the House that the coalition drew attention to the concerns of Australia's nursing home industry about the shortfalls of the National Health Amendment Act 1992 back when the original legislation was passed. There has been much talk in recent years about Australia's ageing population but I wonder whether honourable members and the community appreciate how quickly our community is ageing. In 1989, 1.86 million Australians were aged 65 or over, representing 11.1 per cent of the population. This is expected to increase to between 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the year 2010 and to between 19 per cent and 21 per cent in the year 2031. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we examine the issue of dementia care the statistics become more alarming. Between 1986 and 2006 the projected increase in the sufferers of dementia will rise by over 114 per cent. The future cost to the community will be extravagant and long-term policy decisions need to be taken today to cope adequately with the demands these demographic changes will place on our funding resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 Australia had six working age persons to every aged person. In the year 2031 it is expected that Australia will have three workers for every aged person&mdash;50 per cent. The Labor Party's record in these matters is not surprising, nor is it very comforting, but it confirms the myth and demonstrates the Labor Party's continuing lack of responsibility in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's present aged care system is characterised by overregulation and insufficient and inflexible funding arrangements. These problems are further complicated by the duplication of the provision of services for residential and home care services for the aged by federal, state and local governments. There is no sign of responsibility&mdash;just throw money at a problem, keep throwing money at it and just ignore it. That has been the attitude of the Labor Party for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deficiencies in the present system were identified by the coalition prior to the last federal election. This week those attitudes have been confirmed and reiterated by the reports of Professor Gregory and Mrs Sue Marci. The reports identified the following as major problems with aged care in Australia: an inflexible funding system which prevents any significant efficiency gains through enterprise bargaining; the fact that the current funding system is a disincentive against the upgrading of nursing home stock; and the need to examine state variations in infrastructure costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both reports are critical of the government's policy and lack of action in the area of aged care and they endorse many of the policy positions of the coalition announced before the last election. One of the most important aged care issues confronting Australia, correctly identified by the recent Burdekin report, is the need for better facilities to care for elderly Australians with dementia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Burdekin report identified the chronic underfunding for people with dementia and the fact that some dementia specific aged care facilities are facing such significant recurrent funding shortfalls that there is a real possibility that they may have to shut down. Yet the honourable member for Macquarie was saying how wonderful this government is in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Burdekin's suggestion that purpose designed dementia facilities need to be supported, because they are more humane and cost effective than generic hostels and nursing homes, is an issue that should be top priority for this government. Mr Burdekin's comments are worthy of attention because the present policy of the government is in total contravention of his recommendations; that is, this Labor government prefers to integrate aged Australians with dementia patients into generic hostels and nursing homes. This is more evidence of how out of touch with reality this government really is with the individual&mdash;it would rather work with the collective&mdash;and its poor attitude to the aged care issue. The government's policy is publicly recognised as being less than humane. I remind the House of the findings of the Burdekin report on the mental health of elderly people. Chapter 17 of the report states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Many older people with dementia are being denied their right to treatment in the least restrictive environment:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.Approximately 3000 people with dementia are still confined to psychiatric wards.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.Inadequate support services in the community are forcing older people unnecessarily, or prematurely, into institutional care.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">c.Outdated, inappropriate design and funding arrangements for nursing homes result in some residents who have dementia being physically restrained or sedated as a method of control.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Burdekin goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Purpose-designed dementia facilities must be supported as a more humane and cost-effective form of accommodation than generic facilities. Funds should be allocated immediately for the planning and construction of such facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>This brings me to my second point, that is, the need for improved support for home carers of people with dementia is long overdue. There is now a much stronger need for more flexible and accessible respite care services in our community&mdash;and, dare I say it&mdash;another example of the myth about a so-called caring Labor Party. The Labor Party purports to be a caring party for the individual when it is clearly more for the collective. The need for greater attention for those with dementia was identified by the coalition prior to the last election. Our aged care policy clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major challenge facing the Australian government is the provision of care for our ageing population, particularly with the increasing incidence of dementia . . . the Coalition recognises the varied, changing and growing need for care and accommodation for the aged, arising from the demographics of Australia, and will provide flexible and diverse services.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a responsible attitude to this issue, not one of myth and folklore, or poor action from those opposite. I strongly support our shadow minister's recommendations to the minister. I call upon the minister to review the government's attitude towards aged care. It is no good just talking about it when immediate action is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reinforcing to the House the fact that this government is more concerned with collectives than with showing care for individuals. It has proved that with legislation to do with the family. The social consequences of its other irresponsible legislation are decaying the very vital fabric of the community and its value structures. But we should not be surprised, for this is really part of its ongoing and long-term doctrine. It is time, I guess, for those remaining true believers to look at the last 10 years of decay and ask why. Why have we had to put up with this decay for so long? Talk is cheap; action is required. The government has let the aged people of Australia down in this area. Let me finally say that the Labor Party turned the dreams of expectation into the despair of exploitation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given the list of speakers, including the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), I thought that we were going to have a repetition tonight of the previous two nights. I confess that I was pleasantly wrong. The contribution of the honourable member for Berowra was thoughtful and meaningful, given the fact that the amendments are relatively minor and are essentially of a machinery nature to tidy up what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous), in his second reading speech, called a quirk. That is a nice way of putting it. I thought it was a loophole or a flaw, but `a quirk in the legislation' is an unusual way of describing it. The shadow minister made the point that the opposition was a positive opposition. Until the speech of the honourable member for Berowra tonight, I would not have thought so. But the fact is that his contribution was positive, and I thought that was helpful to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stated earlier this week that in this particular session, with its constraints on censure motions and MPIs, we have had much more debate than I have heard in the past 10 years. That has been terrific. We are even finishing earlier than the times allotted under the guillotine. It has been a wonderful process. The actual level and volume of debate have been markedly improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought the contribution of the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) was very pertinent. Therefore, it was disappointing that a newer member of the House, the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans)&mdash;one of the new leaders of the nation, one of the 147 members of the House of the people, and one who may potentially be in a future government&mdash;does not understand his role and does not follow the leadership of his shadow minister. This leadership suggested that this was not a debate in which the opposition goes silly; there was not really a debate going on here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Cowan raised this concept of the collective versus the individual. When we think it through, what he really means is that we have to build a nursing home for every individual with every condition because a nursing home is a collective&mdash;it must be. I am puzzled by the inference&mdash;which he repeated over and over&mdash;that the government favours a collective over the individual. This means that the opposition, therefore, must want a separate home for every individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also quoted Burdekin and other people. The Burdekin inquiry dealt with people who had psychiatric illnesses, people who were ill. As the honourable member for Cowan would understand, I am sure, given his research on the topic, nursing homes, hostels and aged care were essentially a matter for better responsibility. People with psychiatric illnesses were essentially the responsibility of the state. Mr Burdekin was not examining our hostels or our aged care system, he was examining our health care system&mdash;the mental institutions that have been downsized, not nursing homes or hostels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the zeal and naivety of the new member, even he, I thought, would have been at least aware of the government's program of development of dementia-specific facilities. They have been around for so long now that I thought, surely, he must know. So he firstly has concocted some mythology for himself about ideology. His speech was mainly about ideology rather than the reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about nursing homes, he then got it all wrong by incorrectly using the Burdekin report. In the process, the honourable member insulted all of those who are involved with dementia&mdash;people who have dementia or who have members of their families who have dementia&mdash;by trying to suggest that dementia is an aged problem. It is not. Dementia affects people of all ages&mdash;people as young as 30 years of age and as old as 80 and 90 years of age. It is a condition of which little is known or of which not enough is known, and which both state and federal governments are trying to come to terms with. When we came into government, this condition did not exist in nursing homes at all, as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Cowan did not do himself, his party or his shadow minister justice by introducing such shallow and clearly politically driven proposals into what had been a constructive and positive debate. The idea that somehow at the last election the opposition had all the answers and suddenly unveiled this master plan is ludicrous. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I were elected into the House at the same time. You will recall that, just before that, the McLeay report into aged care had been tabled by the previous Speaker. This became the blueprint for the government's dramatic changes in aged care&mdash;the introduction of the home and community care program in 1985. It took us years of negotiations with the states to achieve that. There was no federal involvement of any nature in home care before this government came along. In 1985, home and community care legislation was brought in as a direct result of the McLeay report, with Senator Grimes as the minister. Federal involvement did not exist before that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Macquarie made fairly clear the position in regard to the community aged care packages that are being established. Hostels are one side of it, but the idea that we can actually emulate hostels in people's homes has been an exciting concept. She also referred to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which is currently undertaking an inquiry into the home and community care program. In the public hearings, which honourable members would no doubt be aware of, the submissions coming forward about the aged care packages have been very positive. Hence, we were not surprised to see them being extended in this budget. Support for the home and community care program in the submissions and the public evidence to the inquiry has been absolutely overwhelming and virtually universal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly in the caring community, particularly the aged care caring community, this government stands very tall and in good esteem. We have been prepared to listen, to review and to re-appraise. I think the shadow minister recognised this and made the point that these amendments, to some degree, were correcting quirks which someone in the opposition had raised. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea that somehow the government and the opposition are poles apart, to coin a phrase, on this topic is simply foolish. I trust the new, zealous and younger member will understand that there are times and places for that kind of debate and that kind of contribution. This was not one of them, and he will certainly lose the respect of other members of the House if he sees every opportunity to speak as an opportunity to slag, bag, denigrate, or establish some ideological platform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, on this particular topic the opposition and the government do not have a great degree of difference. Certainly in the 10 years that I have been a member, I have not seen the opposition particularly acting contrary to the government in terms of support of the evolution of the three forms of aged care. It has supported the HACC program, it has supported the increase in and extensions of the hostel and nursing home systems and, particularly, it has supported the need to come to terms with and understand what frail aged, dementia and other forms of aged care support are about. The idea that somehow they are all generic nursing homes, as the honourable member for Cowan kept talking about, and so on, has long gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the honourable member for Cowan did not see tonight on television Minister Phillips of the New South Wales Liberal government trying to explain the complications of dementia, vis-a-vis Commonwealth and state responsibilities. That really is a complication. The fact is that both state and federal governments have been trying to come to terms with that because it varies so dramatically. But the idea that dementia is solely an aged problem is wrong; the idea that it is solely a mental problem is wrong. I thought Brian Burdekin, to a fair degree, pinpointed that in his report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is concerned and does care. As I mentioned before, there is this constant review and appraisal which is very important because it provides an open and responsive framework. The fact that we are currently undertaking a parliamentary inquiry, by all parties, of the home and community care programs is indicative of this. The terms of reference were supplied by the same minister who manages the nursing home and hostel program. The government has nothing to hide; it is open. I have found to date in that inquiry that opposition members have been very positive, instructive and helpful. That is the way this parliament can work on so many occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one point that has been coming through very clearly&mdash;and has come through to me as a member in recent years&mdash;has been the question of standards of patient or resident rights. It has been interesting the number of people who have said to us that the only way we will ever get complete rights for users of HACC is by making the rights compulsory and mandatory&mdash;as we did eventually with hostels and nursing homes. We talked about them as being a desirable objective for a long time. We were fairly gentle, and we were pushing, but we only ever got somewhere when the charter of rights was made compulsory. That is not what we are saying, but it is what the community is saying to us. Eventually, I think we will see that both sides of parliament will agree with that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question is that of standards. Any form of quality procedures or evaluation is difficult, whether it be in human services, aged services, health services or manufacturing, because it is impossible to make it totally objective, despite our best endeavours. We will see from time to time complaints and concerns expressed by both sides of an argument about how standards work. But the important thing is that there has to be bipartisan support for the need for standards in aged care, and I believe there is. We may disagree about how we achieve it, and we may disagree in terms of the methodology and some of the philosophy, but I do not think we disagree with the need for there to be standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have seen in recent years a movement towards a charter of rights for people who live in nursing homes and hostels, and towards standards of delivery of service in such institutions. We have been forced to consider these in the parliamentary committee because of the submissions and evidence given publicly, and it is also a concern in the home care system, whether it be in the community aged care packages or in the home and community care program itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are, as the parliamentary secretary said in his second reading speech, to correct a quirk in the legislation. Both amendments are appropriate and they are not contested. It is an opportunity&mdash;a potentially important opportunity&mdash;for members of the House to indicate their attitudes and values on aged care, and support for aged care. I am very proud to be part of a parliament which, in general&mdash;with the minor exception I mentioned earlier&mdash;is unanimous in supporting the need for aged care support and the way in which we do it. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and as the honourable member for Cowan may well learn&mdash;people come to Australia constantly to look at how we do it. We are recognised worldwide as one of the leaders in providing support for our older people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know as a parliamentarian that when visiting other countries one of the questions often asked of me by other parliamentarians is about our aged care system. Questions are often asked about Medicare as well, but the two things asked about as individual systems are our aged care system and our Medicare system. Those systems evoke the most comments and queries in terms of our human services. It is not a matter of dispute. At the same time, I am sure those opposite are as proud as we are, because we do not see this as being simply a Labor Party or government issue. From my understanding, on the aged care support, there has been bipartisan support for most of my time in parliament. I think that says a great deal about how effective our system can be. The amendments are minor; they correct a quirk in the legislation. I trust they meet with the support of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I am going to address my remarks to the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3), which is part of this cognate debate. I am going to raise something which, for me, is a first in this House, but I can assure honourable members that it is not going to be the last time, because I believe the issue I am going to raise is one of more than passing concern and interest for nearly 50 per cent of the population of Australia. As I look around the House, I can see that we have a lady in the press gallery, a lady attendant and some ladies in the public gallery. Almost any Australian we talk to would be aware of the benefit of pap smears for the detection of cervical cancer in women. I think all Australians, male and female, would be conscious of the need for mammography for breast cancer screening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if we talk about the prostate, a male area which is becoming more and more important and significant in terms of health care in this country, I venture to suggest that a very high percentage of males would not have a clue what we are talking about.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did a very small survey today when I spoke to three young males in their 20s. All three are intelligent, and at least one and probably two are university graduates. I said, `Where is your prostate?'. They said, `It is down there somewhere'. I said, `What does it do? What is it there for?'. They said that they did not have a clue. I think this illustrates the very widespread ignorance about the function of the prostate in male physiology and of how dangerous it can be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prostate cancer is the second most deadly cancer in men in this country. It is a great killer. It has the highest incidence in males of any cancer. We do not talk about it; we do not discuss it. We have got no research programs, and we have got no screening facilities. As I said, this is the first time that I have introduced this subject in the House, but it will not be the last. I have not undertaken anywhere near the research that I will be doing in the next few months, and I do not have all the figures I would like to be able to present to the House. But in New South Wales in 1990 there were 2,048 new cases of prostate cancer in men, and 808 deaths; that is a pretty high death rate. In the same year, in New South Wales, for cervical cancer in women, there were only 372 new cases, with 117 deaths. Therefore, I think it is fairly obvious that, in spite of the widespread nature of prostate cancer, it is being ignored very largely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that cervical cancer in women is at such a low level. It has still got a long way to go, but it is because of the screening projects and pap smears that that has happened. We still need to encourage more widespread use of pap smears and more research. Pap smears are encouraged for women after their first sexual experience and then every two years. But for males there is no early screening for prostate cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If men think of it, they can act on simple symptoms such as difficulty in urinating. Unfortunately, I guess with advancing age&mdash;I am delighted to say I have not reached that point myself&mdash;many elderly men who are experiencing this difficulty do not recognise it for what it is and think it is just a symptom of advancing age; that it is just a normal part of old age coming on, but it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should never accept cancer&mdash;whether it be breast cancer, cervical cancer or prostate cancer&mdash;as the norm. Assessing whether somebody has prostate cancer can be done by ultrasound, by rectal examination, or by a biopsy of prostate tissue. It has got to the point now, because of this very widespread growth in the incidence of prostate cancer, that probably men over the age of 50 should have a medical every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body it invades the bones and bone marrow, reduces the person's vitality, and causes terrible pain. There is a dramatic decrease in the quality of life. It is very important to get the treatment right. The two most successful options are surgical removal of the whole prostate or precision bombardment of the tumour with X-rays&mdash;and, of course, that radiation is best in small doses over a number of weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding for research is at an absolute minimum, like the research for many other diseases. Unfortunately, Australia spends only 1.4 per cent of total health expenditure on medical research and, by world standards, this is deplorable. Research into another vital cancer, breast cancer, is also lagging, and breast cancer kills six Australian women a day. However, the funding disparity between breast cancer research and other diseases is alarming. In Australia, AIDS attracts $62 million annually for research and this is a good thing&mdash;I do not criticise that at all. But that compares with an allocation of only $29.8 million in 1993-94 for a national program for early detection of breast cancer. We need to do much more to fight breast cancer. As a point of comparison, in the United States breast cancer research attracts at least $US400 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an increase in the diagnosis of breast cancer, due in part to early detection. The diagnostic mammography to investigate breast lumps and related concerns has been very effective. Australian women need all the help they can get in combating breast cancer. It affects our wives, mothers, grandmothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, cousins and friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the amount of information available&mdash;good as it is&mdash;looking at it in detail, it still seems that women can find out more about getting their cars repaired than getting the optimal treatment for this cancer. That is why we must raise women's awareness about breast cancer. They need access to screening measures and to other preventative measures to ensure they are not subjected to massive mastectomies. The government could increase research funding by introducing a 150 per cent tax deduction for donations specifically made to fund research into breast cancer. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point very clearly that people suffering from breast cancer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer have a very great possibility of ending up in nursing homes. I look forward to the findings of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into breast cancer screening and treatment, which is due to report in 1994. I certainly support a national program for the early detection of breast cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1993-94 the Commonwealth has given $28.8 million to the program for the early detection of small cancers and reducing the number of deaths from breast cancer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm), the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans), the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for their participation in this debate on the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill. I will begin by trying to meet some of the concerns raised, but also by emphasising the general theme in all of the speeches&mdash;with the possible exception of the honourable member for Cowan&mdash;namely, the bipartisan concern with ensuring that the federal government and the federal parliament provide aged care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shift in the area of aged care was, I think, adopted initially by the Fraser government. But under the Hawke government there was a dramatic increase in aged care through implementation of the recommendations in respect of home and community care. There has since been a massive expansion in the number of nursing homes and hostels and a number of other major programs to assist the aged, the overwhelming proportion of which are funded by the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that if the federal parliament had not adopted this approach we would be faced with a crisis in our social programs. We are an ageing population. In 1970 less than one million people were aged over 65 years; by 1990 there were two million; and, by the year 2031, it is expected that 5 1/2 million Australians will be aged 65 and over. In other words, the number of old people in the population is virtually doubling every 15 years or so. Therefore, we face the difficult problem of continuing to provide a life of dignity for these people so that they can live not merely in reasonable health and have their health care needs met, but also, importantly, have a quality of life commensurate with a civilised society and one which is consistent with the kinds of civilised values in which we believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, Commissioner Burdekin is right in emphasising the interconnection between human rights, social rights and the rights of people such as the aged and, indeed, those suffering from mental health problems. We need to embed in the consciousness of Australians this whole idea of what makes us different from other democratic societies, especially those democratic societies that are only beginning to develop. That is the fact that, in this society, in our form of democracy, certain social rights are taken to be fundamental to the democratic edifice. One of those is the right to a pension and support in old age. The honourable member for Berowra is correct in saying that we have a certain level of bipartisanship on these matters. He wanted to draw a long bow in suggesting that the opposition has suddenly become constructive because there has been agreement on a number of areas in his shadow portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since the budget was brought down we have had mostly disagreement and division in this parliament. Nevertheless, I am very happy to see that the honourable member for Berowra is being constructive in accepting the totality of the bill. I will also be constructive in that I will move to accept the opposition's amendment in the committee stage. We are all trying to be as constructive as we can in achieving this outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra wanted some answers to certain questions concerning issues that came out of the Burdekin report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human rights and mental illness</EMPHASIS>. Today the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) issued a statement, and also answered a question in this House, in which he made it clear that we will be examining the Burdekin report in detail. I want to put on record that I welcome the Burdekin report. I do not agree with one particular honourable member who has tried to denigrate Commissioner Burdekin and his report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Burdekin report is extremely serious and important. It is true to say, as many of the newspapers said today, that the situation revealed in the report is disgraceful. It is one which we, as a society, have to come to grips with. The fact that a situation has arisen because of neglect and bureaucratic buck-passing between federal, state and local governments does not in itself justify what has occurred. It is one of the problems that we have in our constitutional arrangements. We need to make our arrangements more efficient so that in every important area the people will know which government is going to be held responsible and in what ways. In that way we will not have the very sorry situation that has arisen with the mentally ill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra was particularly concerned with care for the aged, and especially with aged people suffering from dementia. That is a matter that Mr Burdekin addressed. We know that there have been a number of reviews of aged care, and the issue raised by Mr Burdekin was widely canvassed in the second stage of the mid-term review of aged care. If the implication in Commissioner Burdekin's report is that the Commonwealth forces integration of dementia sufferers into nursing homes or hostels, my response is that this is not the case. We do not force a mix between residents suffering with dementia and those who are not mentally ill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has supported a diversity of approaches on this point. As I mentioned at the outset, the government is going to give a detailed response on all these matters. The commissioner makes a valid point when he says that there is a danger in some instances of a person suffering from serious dementia being placed in a mixed arrangement. We have to look at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I undertake to ensure that the government's review will look into that matter. Tonight Mr Phillips, the New South Wales minister, appeared on television with Mr Burdekin. He made it clear that the problem of dementia is complicated by the fact that it is not sufficient to say there are people with dementia and people without dementia. It is a graded situation. Some people are suffering from very heavy dementia and are virtually incapable of performing even basic functions. There are other people who have only some small amount of memory loss, for example, and who are generally quite easy to put into an integrated situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at this whole category. We have some people with light dementia, some people with middle dementia, if I might say so, and some people with heavy dementia. We have to decide how they are going to be treated. We need to be sensitive to these categorisations. To deal with this matter we need to see what is the most appropriate form of care and accommodation for these people. I undertake to ensure that the government, when looking at its response to the Burdekin report, will also focus on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to another matter raised by the honourable member for Berowra, and this concerned the question of what is happening with the validation program. I think we all agree that there is a need for this validation process as a result of problems in the past and it is our responsibility to ensure that funds which have been misapplied by owners of nursing homes are fully recovered. The honourable member for Berowra asks whether the government is prepared to make a commitment that the secretary will advise potential purchasers of nursing homes of the estimate arrived at as a result of the investigation. Buyers should still exercise caution in commercial arrangements. The answer to the honourable member's question is yes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making his determination the secretary will look into this matter. We give that undertaking. In cases where the estimate is out and there is a difference, of course the money will be refunded. The most important thing is that we get a very secure validation program in place and we are able to recoup this money which is owing to the Commonwealth. We have already put measures into place to try to ensure that these sorts of problems do not recur in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that there will be many other issues in aged care coming before this parliament. Next year I hope to present the bill from the Law Reform Commission. We will be putting all the aged care bills into one. I hope we will be able to have a wide ranging debate on all aspects of aged care. By that time I hope that the recommendations of the Gregory report will also be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Cowan made reference to the Gregory report and seemed to suggest that the government was not acting on it. Let me make two points.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill and cognate bills seek to put in place a range of new measures, many of which were announced in the budget. Four of the measures being proposed are quite substantial: namely, the formalisation of excise arrangements applicable to blended fuel products; the provision of a payment to producers of naphtha; the introduction of a series of changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme; and the imposition of an excise on beer brewed in micro-breweries. The coalition will not be opposing the first two of those amendments. For the benefit of the House, I would like to briefly run through these measures as well as to make a couple of comments on the coalition's position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is currently common practice for larger fuel companies and refineries to carry out a production process where they blend a number of petroleum and crude oil products. This blending is undertaken on the oil company's premises and duty is paid on the full blend at a rate equal to either the diesel or leaded petrol rate. The conduct of these activities and payment of duty is not subject to legislation but operates according to an informal arrangement between the major refineries and the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, the Australian Customs Service has been made aware of the activities of some operators, such as service station owners, who are also engaging in blending activities. Not only does this result in a loss of revenue to the Commonwealth but it also poses a considerable safety risk. As the premises of some blenders are not licensed there is no requirement for them to operate according to recognised standards. This package of bills proposes to redress that situation by requiring all premises&mdash;including refineries, service stations and other business operations&mdash;that blend petroleum and oil products to be licensed and to have duty paid on the full value of the blended substance at either the diesel or leaded petrol rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second measure being proposed amends provisions relating to substances produced from shale mined in Australia. One amendment is simply a housekeeping measure to remove an outdated provision which gives gasoline and mineral turpentine produced from shale mined in Australia an exemption from duty. This particular provision was first introduced after World War II when considerable reserves of shale were found in the mountain ranges of New South Wales. Shale is no longer mined, nor is its derivative used to manufacture petroleum. Accordingly, the provisions giving an exemption from duty are redundant and are now being removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second component introduces a new measure to encourage the mining of shale and its downstream processing into naphtha. The naphtha will subsequently be marketed to petroleum companies for use in the production of gasoline. Following the development of new technology in Canada, a private sector joint venture has announced plans to mine shale and process it into naphtha in Gladstone in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has agreed to refund naphtha producers the excise duty payable on a limited volume of unleaded gasoline produced from the naphtha. A similar arrangement currently applies to the production of natural gas. The payments do not commence until 1996-97, will terminate in 2005, and will be limited to 600,000 barrels of unleaded gasoline per year. Projects must use innovative technology and each must be approved for assistance by the minister. The coalition endorses this policy as it applies to natural gas and is happy to extend the same treatment to the producers of naphtha. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two key amendments proposed in this package are a different story altogether. The coalition has major concerns about both of these measures and, accordingly, I propose to confine the remainder of my remarks this evening to those two proposals. In respect of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading because of the merit of the proposals it contains in relation to blended petroleum products and to naphtha producers, the House calls on the Government to abandon the iniquitous and unreasonable proposals which will curtail the diesel fuel rebate scheme and impose duties on beer brewed in micro-breweries".</PARA>
<PARA>I also foreshadow that, in respect of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2.) 1993, I will be moving a second reading amendment calling on the government to abandon its ill-conceived plans to impose duties on beer brewed in micro-breweries. In the committee stage of debate&mdash;if time permits, that is&mdash;I shall be moving amendments to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill to delete provisions relating to the diesel fuel rebate scheme and micro-breweries. I also foreshadow that, if times permits, the coalition shall be opposing the Diesel Fuel (Excise Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill and the Diesel Fuel (Customs Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill outright. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The diesel fuel rebate scheme has been in existence in some form or another since 1957. The scheme provides a refund of excise paid on diesel fuel to registered users in the primary industry, mining, hospital and nursing home areas. The Commonwealth collected $2.6 billion in excise on diesel fuel in 1992-93 and estimates that it will collect around $3.1 billion this financial year. Of this, $898 million was rebated to users in 1992-93, while around $1 billion is expected to be rebated during this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mining industry is the biggest single industry user of diesel fuel, receiving rebates of $486 million in the last financial year, or just over 54 per cent of total rebates paid. The primary industry sector, including farmers, fishermen and those involved in forestry, is the second biggest user, receiving rebates of $395 million, or 44 per cent of all rebates paid. Nursing homes and hospitals make up the remainder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is seeking to restrict the application of the scheme and, in the process, generate additional revenue for its coffers. It has outlined three separate initiatives to achieve this. Firstly, claims for diesel fuel excise rebates are proposed to be limited to three years. Currently, a rebate of excise paid on diesel fuel can be claimed in respect of fuel purchased since 1986. The bills before the House seek to place a three-year time limit on the lodgment of rebate claims. The amendment is scheduled to come into effect on 1 January 1994, which means from this date rebates will be payable only in respect of diesel fuel purchased within three years of that date of application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the excise levied on diesel fuel is currently adjusted twice per year for inflation&mdash;in February and August. The rebates paid to claimants are also adjusted twice a year. The government proposes to limit the adjustments of rebates paid on diesel fuel to just once a year, generating savings and cash flow benefits to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third measure announced in the budget was the imposition of a fee equal to one per cent of the rebate payment to process the rebate claim. The administrative fee is payable to the Australian Customs Service. This particular measure is largely implemented by the Diesel Fuel (Customs Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993 and the Diesel Fuel (Excise Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993, both of which are part of the package we are debating here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already mentioned, the coalition is vehemently opposed to all of these measures, and we are opposing them for a number of reasons. Firstly, the one per cent administration fee is effectively yet another tax for which this government has no mandate. During the last election campaign&mdash;which started when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) delivered his failed One Nation statement&mdash;we did not hear a single word about tax hikes. We heard plenty about tax cuts but absolutely nothing about new tax burdens. Yet, within six months of the election, the voters of Australia have been hit with increases in sales tax, fuel excise, wine tax, tax on long service leave payouts and of course this tax which will make diesel fuel more expensive for business users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tax is even more appalling because it imposes yet another cost on business. Diesel fuel is a key input to many businesses and is used as part of their normal commercial operations. The administrative fee must eventually be built into their costs and hence their prices, making them more expensive in the domestic market and less competitive on the international market. The farming sector, for example, in 1990-91 exported over $9 billion worth of goods. Similarly, the mining sector earned over $10 billion in export revenue in 1990-91. Surely, given the very tough world trading conditions, we should be encouraging our industries to compete internationally, not hindering them. Make no mistake about it: this new charge hinders our businesses and it increases their costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second key point which must be made about the government's plans to impose a one per cent administrative fee is that it does not place any onus on the government to administer the scheme efficiently. Rather, it is simply looking at the cost of the current procedures, then slugging industry a similar amount. Moreover, there is no requirement for the government to contain the future costs of administration. If the costs blow out, the government can simply whack up the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the administration of the scheme by the Australian Customs Service, I came across some interesting figures. According to material provided to a Senate estimates committee, the cost of running the diesel fuel rebate scheme is about $6 million per annum. This includes salaries, the cost of travel and other administrative expenses. In the last financial year, some 229,495 claims for diesel fuel rebate were paid. A little arithmetic shows that the cost of processing each claim was $26.14. This is an outrageous sum&mdash;$26.14 to process each and every claim for rebate of excise. One has to wonder, quite frankly, what they do over there in the Australian Customs Service. One has to wonder whether they actually print the paper they write the cheque on. More importantly, this figure adds weight to the arguments of the coalition that there is a considerable scope for reform in the administration of this scheme. It is my firm belief that the government should look at this first&mdash;clean up its own backyard, so to speak&mdash;before slugging industry this substantial cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the material provided to the Senate estimates committee estimates the cost of administering the diesel full rebate scheme at around $6 million per year, yet some $10 million will be raised by this administration fee. This gives a windfall gain to the government at the expense of Australian business. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table, could explain why the fee was set at one per cent and not at a rate which would simply cover costs. Senator Schacht's explanation to a Senate estimates committee hearing that `this was the rate recommended by the Auditor-General' is, quite frankly, not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore up to the parliamentary secretary representing the minister to justify why this government is making a profit out of Australian business. I point out to the parliamentary secretary that the forerunner to the diesel fuel rebate scheme was a diesel fuel excise exemption certificate, which required little administration at all. It assisted rather than penalised Australian industry. Of course, this is not the only gain to be made by the government from its proposed measures. First, in seeking to impose a three-year time limit on claims for rebate, the Commonwealth will retain all of the unclaimed excise paid between 1986 and 1991. Secondly, in adjusting the rebate for inflation only once a year, the Commonwealth will gain considerable cash flow benefits. The explanatory memorandum to the bill puts these gains at nearly $16 million in 1994-95 and $17 million in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I am concerned about the anomalies which the one per cent fee opens up. Industry receives an exemption from or rebate of other taxes and charges without having to pay an administration fee. If we are to follow this as a trend, will the government's next move be to levy a fee for processing income tax refunds of workers? The question why the users of diesel fuel rebate have been discriminated against must be answered, although perhaps of more concern is whether this fee is simply the first to be applied and sets a precedent for the imposition of other administration fees and charges. For all of these reasons, the coalition is determined to oppose these provisions in the bill which amend the diesel fuel rebate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second key amendment proposed in this package of bills, and on which I would like to comment, concerns the imposition of an excise on beer brewed in micro-breweries. Excise has been imposed on beer since Federation. In 1973 the government decided to exempt beer brewed at home from excise because it was produced on private premises and not for commercial gain. The intention of the amendment was to ensure that only beer produced on commercial premises for sale or some other form of commercial gain would be subject to excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 18 months a new method of producing beer has become available to the consumers, namely brew-on-premise shops, or micro-breweries as they have become otherwise known. Beer produced in these shops is not currently subject to excise. The concept of brew-on-premise shops, BOP shops as they are commonly known, originated in Canada, where there are some 240 shops in operation. The BOP shops are essentially small, do-it-yourself, retail, hobby shops, which provide the facilities and ingredients for the customers to brew beer for their home consumption. Up to 50 litres of beer can be brewed by any one customer per visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In utilising BOP shops, customers simply walk in off the street, purchase the ingredients, which are subject to sales tax, choose a recipe, rent the equipment and then set about making their own beer. The customer physically mixes the ingredients, produces the beer, leaves it for about two weeks, and then comes back to bottle the beer and take it home. The brew-on-premise customers spend about three hours of their time over two visits. I actually visited a brew-on-premise shop in Perth, and can assure the House that they are only small hobby operations, their customers are not shop staff and, of course, the customers have responsibility for the production of their own beer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package of legislation proposes to license brew-on-premise shops and to impose excise on beer brewed on their premises. The application of excise in this case goes against the spirit of the imposition of excise. Excise is a tax on production levied where goods are produced for commercial gain. This is the principle underpinning the government's decision to exempt home-brew from excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While beer brewed in BOP shops is brewed on commercial premises, the equipment is actually rented by the customer, and the customer has full responsibility for the production of his or her own beer. Moreover, the beer is brewed solely for home consumption. The only commercial element in the process is the rented equipment and the purchase of the ingredients. As such, the process by which beer is brewed in BOP shops is far more similar to the process used in beer brewed at home, to which excise does not apply, than to that undertaken by the commercial breweries, the produce of which is subject to excise. Given this, the coalition does not believe that there are any grounds for distinguishing between beer brewed at home and beer brewed in BOP shops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already mentioned, the concept of brew-on-premise shops originated in Canada. Beer brewed in Canadian BOP shops is not subject to excise, although the premises must be licensed. Beer brewed commercially is, of course, subject to excise. A circular on the matter, issued by the Canadian National Revenue Office, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 172 of the Excise Act allows for the production of beer, exempt of excise duty for non-commercial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>The circular goes on to define a brew-on-premise operation as a:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . commercial establishment providing equipment, raw materials and technical advice, where a person can brew and package beer for personal or family consumption or to be given away without charge, and not for sale or commercial use.</PARA>
<PARA>The Canadian brew-on-premise industry has grown quite  rapidly. A number of industry groups, including those representing commercial breweries and the hotel industry, argue that the Australian business could experience a similar growth rate, with a detrimental impact on the industry. I dispute this fact. Much of the evidence available, which is patchy and largely anecdotal, suggests that many BOP shop customers previously made their beer at home. They are attracted to the brew-on-premise shops because of the better quality of the product, the hands-on element and, of course, the cost. Hence, the growing custom of BOP shops appears to be at the expense of the home-brew market and not the commercial mainstream beer market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with many other taxes announced in the budget, the government does not have a mandate for this tax either. Again, it was not even hinted at in the lead-up to the election. In fact, in correspondence received by one of the brew-on-premise shops in October of 1992, the Australian Customs Service confirmed that excise did not apply to beer brewed in brew-on-premise shops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In debating the budget taxes, the coalition has expressed particular concern about those taxes which fall hardest on those on low incomes. The clientele of brew-on-premise shops are, in the main, low income earners and migrants who brew their own beer to save money. They are the group who can least afford another tax burden and who have suffered most under this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it is worth pointing out that the brew-on-premise concept is a budding industry which does not deserve to be taxed out of existence. Just as the wine industry was allowed to remain free of any tax burden in its infancy, so too should the same principle be extended to the brew-on-premise shops. Of course, BOP shops are still subject to a range of other state and federal taxes and charges, including sales tax, land tax and, of course, the superannuation levy. The coalition opposes the application of excise to beer brewed in BOP shops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because I suspect that a lack of time will preclude us from moving our amendments in the committee stage of debate, the coalition will divide on the second reading amendment. We do this to emphasise the strength of our opposition to the government's plans to limit the diesel fuel rebate scheme and impose excise on micro-breweries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill and cognate bills, which are now before the House. Earlier this year the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, the Diesel Fuel (Customs Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993 and the Diesel Fuel (Excise Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993 were introduced into the parliament to give effect to some measures announced in the 1993-94 budget. The amendments covered a range of matters, which included the diesel rebate scheme, micro-breweries, the blending of petroleum products, petroleum substitution, and excise matters relating to the production of naphtha from shale oil. In the time that is available to me tonight, I would like to expand on the amendments as they relate to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Later on in the debate my colleagues will expand on other matters to which I have just referred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current rebate scheme was first introduced by the Fraser government in 1982 and, previous to that, a diesel fuel exemption certificate scheme operated, which allowed the purchase of diesel fuel for off-road purposes excise free. That scheme was abandoned in favour of the current rebate scheme due to several factors, one important factor being the rising level of abuse under the old exemption certificate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what I understand the shadow minister was saying tonight, he is arguing for a reintroduction of the old fuel exemption arrangements on the grounds that they would be administratively cheaper. But I think he ought to keep in mind that, even under that scheme, the bona fides of users would still have to be checked, exemption certificates issued, sales records of distributors audited and field officers required to verify the end use. For this collection of reasons, the government does not favour this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills introduce three important initiatives in the diesel fuel rebate scheme; an administrative fee of one per cent on the value of rebates payable to claimants, the annual indexation of rebates and a requirement that claims for rebate be lodged within three years from the date of fuel purchase. An important reason for these amendments to the diesel fuel rebate scheme is the need for the government to contain the costs of the scheme. The government is faced with a difficult choice, given the enormous escalation in the costs of the scheme. For example, in 1982-83, some $76 million was paid out under this scheme. It is estimated that in 1992-93, $898 million will be the cost and it is expected that in 1993-94 over $1 billion will be rebated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several factors contribute to this growth in expenditure. In 1989 the scheme was broadened, which caused an increase in expenditure. In the mining and agricultural sectors over the last decade there has been an increase in the use of this particular fuel, although that has declined recently. Also, decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court throughout the 1980s have seen a broad interpretation of the scheme, which has been in favour of applicants. These and other factors have contributed to the increasing burden on Commonwealth outlays. As the shadow minister has eloquently argued, perhaps this is not the correct or the most opportune time to be introducing these measures, given that some parts of the agricultural sector are recessed and we are experiencing, in some areas, low commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if the government is to be fiscally responsible&mdash;which it has been in the presentation of this budget and in setting out a long-term fiscal strategy for the nation&mdash;it needs to take action now for that particular reason; to contain the costs of this scheme. We ought to keep in mind, as far as the agricultural producers of this nation are concerned, that there have been considerable savings in costs to this sector by the good management of the government in lowering the inflation rate and achieving quite low rates of interest. Of course, some sectors have been advantaged by the devaluation of the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take up the measures contained in these amendments. As I stated before, over $1 billion is expected to be rebated in 1993-94. The cost of administration is expected to be in excess of $11 million. The government has programmed a set of recovery mechanisms that will lead to the following amounts being recovered over the next three years: in 1993-94, $5 million will be received over the six-month period; in 1994-95, it will be $11.7 million; and in 1995-96, $12.6 million. The government has opted for this basis of calculating the charge; that is, on the value of the rebate cheque, because greater resources are needed to audit the larger claims. The bona fides of claimants need to be checked and this is, in the more complex cases, a costly process. In addition, the larger claimants are generally more prepared to litigate against the Customs Service, before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court, over rather borderline eligibility issues. Consequently, the government has opted to levy on this basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as indexation is concerned, the purpose of the amendment is to adjust the rate of rebate only once a year to compensate for the twice-yearly indexation of the excise and customs duty on diesel fuel. The proposed duty arrangements will permit duty and rebate rates payable in respect of primary production to be aligned with each other by 1 February each year, but to move apart during the following 12 months. After the initial alignment of rebate rates for primary production and duty rates on 1 February 1994, the next indexation will occur in February 1995 and will operate from then, so that rebate rates will be adjusted each February for the indexation effects on duty rates of the preceding August and February. These proposed amendments will lower the administrative costs of the scheme and will certainly simplify its administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of retrospective claims, the present situation, as the shadow minister indicated, is that the claims can be lodged for fuel purchases as far back as 1986. The measures introduced by the government have been to streamline the administration of the scheme and to introduce greater certainty in rebate expenditures. It is a reasonable measure and it is consistent with the refund provisions applying for sales tax purposes. On the financial impact of these measures&mdash;and I am dealing here with measures other than the imposition of the administration charge&mdash;the amendments are expected to result in the following savings: $3.9 million in the financial year 1993-94, $15.8 million in 1994-95 and $16.9 million in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These measures are fiscally responsible. The government has set an economic and fiscal strategy for the nation. The measures proposed in this package of bills are part of the long-term strategy of the government to contain expenditure, control the deficit and bring it down over the life of this parliament to one per cent of GDP by 1996. Therefore, these measures introduced by the minister are essential to the achievement of that objective. I commend the measures to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendments moved by my colleague the shadow minister for industry, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), who spoke earlier this evening. I do so because I genuinely believe that the administrative charge that the government is proposing to introduce on the excise rebate for diesel fuel is a tax that industry cannot afford to wear, particularly in light of other taxes that the government has increased since the 17 August budget. We heard tonight from my colleague that the cost of administering the diesel fuel excise rebate scheme runs to around $6 million per annum.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some $11 million, as I am corrected by my colleague opposite, the honourable member for Herbert. At the same time, the amount of money raised by the charge, we are reliably informed, is well in excess of that amount. One can say from the example given by my colleague earlier tonight that this is simply another way of raising revenue from those industries that can least afford it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our mining and farming industries enjoy an excise rebate on diesel. Both these industries are exporters, which means that they have no capacity to pass on increased costs in their price structure for the product that they sell. They have to take what the market will pay; they have no capacity to pass on the cost increases, whether they be imposed by government in the form of increased charges or increased taxes or whether they be other cost increases that relate more particularly to the costs of production in their own industry. They must wear the costs themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately this means that if costs and government taxes and charges go up, jobs are lost. If jobs are lost, it simply adds further to the problem that Australia has been suffering over the last couple of years&mdash;high unemployment levels reaching around 11 per cent, where they remain today. It is not only important but it is also symbolic that the opposition is moving these amendments tonight. Since the 17 August budget we have outlined our opposition to the government's proposals to increase taxes and charges on a whole range of industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason for opposing the increases is that during the election campaign the government indicated that it would not be increasing taxes. I am sure honourable members can remember what the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will be delivering the tax cuts without tax increases.</PARA>
<PARA>The government is introducing into the House tonight a tax increase in another form. Just as the 5c per litre tax on diesel and unleaded fuel is an increase, the 7c per litre in leaded fuel is another tax increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this evening the House received a message from the Senate requesting amendment to a number of the fuel tax increases. The legislation was pushed through the House of Representatives earlier today without any debate at all from this side of the House. It is a disgraceful state of affairs when members of the opposition in this House are denied the opportunity to put their views on one of the most important tax increases in the federal budget brought down a couple of months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increased revenue raised by the 5c per litre increase in fuel and 7c per litre increase in leaded fuel runs into hundreds of millions of dollars this year and in excess of a billion dollars in a normal year after this current year. Those sorts of tax increases deserve fair, reasonable and sufficient debate in our parliament. Earlier tonight the opposition was gagged from debating those particular tax increases. Fortunately in this particular debate we have the opportunity to discuss one very small aspect of the tax increases that users of diesel will experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today the Senate, in its wisdom, exempted the fuel tax increase on fuels used by the shipping and rail industries. I believe this will benefit Australians generally, just as it will benefit Australians generally if the amendment that has been moved by my colleague the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) is accepted. The purpose of the Senate's amendments earlier today and the amendment moved by my colleague tonight is to ensure that we do not push up the price of transport and thus the cost of production beyond levels that we had in August of this year. To do so will simply make Australia a less competitive place to produce goods and to sell those goods into our export marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members might say that the few million dollars that this administrative charge imposes does not make a big difference to our competitive position in the international marketplace. Whilst that is probably true, I think it is worth debating these amendments tonight because they are symbolic of this government's cargo cult mentality when it comes to matters relating to transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am giving a speech in Sydney tomorrow at the annual conference of the Australian Livestock Transport Association. It is interesting to note that, after these tax increases on fuel, the average trucker will be paying around $1,000 a week in taxes. Obviously a person who is travelling from Sydney to Melbourne will be doing many kilometres per year, burning a lot of fuel, using many tyres and buying many spare parts. The truck will be worn out much more quickly and he will be paying a lot more tax on average. That is a shocking state of affairs. What this means is that those who struggle to make a living will now make a lesser living because of the increased taxes that they will have to pay. Ultimately, the taxes that are borne by the transport industry will be passed on to the users: miners, farmers and those who will be receiving a rebate as a result of the legislation being debated tonight. Others are not going to enjoy the rebate that is being afforded this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take the road transport forum's accounts to be accurate, the cost of the average shopping trolley will go up by between $2 and $3 per week. That is the net consequence of this government's cargo cult mentality when it decides to tax the transport industry through the measures being introduced in the House tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can no longer afford to continue taxing transport as this government has done for the 10 1/2 years that it has been in power. This budget has increased the fuel excise to 31c per litre for diesel and unleaded fuel and 33c per litre for leaded fuel. When the government came into power 10 1/2 years ago, fuel excise was 6c a litre. So we have gone from 6c a litre to 31c and 33c a litre in excise on fuel. That is an incredible increase, certainly way in excess of any inflationary spiral that we would have seen over that 10 1/2 year period. This measure is imposing more tax on the transport industry. Since this government was elected 10 1/2 years ago it has just used this industry as a vehicle through which to raise more tax revenue. It was 6c a litre 10 1/2 years ago; it is 31c and 33c a litre today. Of the $10 billion-odd that will be raised in fuel excise in the next financial year, less than $1 billion will be allocated towards road funding. Some $813 million will be allocated towards road funding out of the $10 billion that is raised out of fuel excise in the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transport users are paying more tax, as we have seen in this bill before the House this evening and as we saw in the Senate earlier today. The opportunity to debate this matter was denied us by the government's determination to gag debate earlier tonight on other taxes relating to the transport industry. The government is taking more money from our road users and giving less back, which is causing most people in this country to be outraged. That is why the opposition is determined to oppose this measure and other measures related to increasing the cost of fuel and transport. We are determined that the road transport industry, the rail industry, the maritime industry and all fuel users&mdash;whether they are driving their 1975 Holden or whether they are generating electricity for themselves at some remote area in Queensland or some other part of Australia&mdash;enjoy lower taxes on their fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why our opposition has been so strong and determined. That is why in the Senate earlier today the opposition moved amendments and that is why the Senate carried a number of those amendments that the opposition had put forward. That is why my colleague earlier in this debate this evening moved amendments to ensure that this government, if it tries to get away with taxing our fuels and transport industry, at least does so with the full light of day shining on it. People in the transport industry and people who are interested in using their own cars, concerned with the cost of living and concerned about making Australia a competitive country from which we can export our goods and in which we can create jobs will then have the opportunity to see what this government is up to. The government is not about trying to make Australia a more competitive place; it is about taxing people to breaking point. That is what it is doing to the transport industry. That is what this bill before the House tonight does in its own small but very symbolic way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons I am very happy to support the amendments that have been moved by my colleague the honourable member for Forrest tonight. I know that other members of the opposition will agree, as I am sure all members of the Australian transport industry and indeed most Australians would, that that is the reason the government has plunged in the polls. That is why the government has had so much trouble getting its budget through the Senate. People can see quite clearly that this government is not doing things in the best interest of Australians; it is doing things in its own party political best interests. I think Australians can see quite clearly, from the bill that we are debating tonight and from other bills that have been in the Senate over the last few weeks, that this government did not tell us the truth during the election campaign. When it said that it would deliver the tax cuts without any tax increases, it had no intention of doing that. The budget proved it. The bill before us tonight adds further to the proof that we have had over the last few months that this government went right through the election campaign telling the people of Australia one thing whilst intending to do quite the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason alone, the government deserves to be condemned. It deserves to have elements of its budget knocked back. Indeed, the government deserves to be seen for what it is: a shameless group of people intent on doing nothing other than taxing our road transport industry, our shipping industry, our rail industry and ordinary motorists, whether they be rich or poor, employed or unemployed, old or young. The government is doing it simply to cover up for its shameless mismanagement of the Australian economy. It is for that reason that we move these amendments. Members of the opposition will be supporting those amendments to do away with or to try to overcome this government's cargo cult mentality when it comes to transport in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">The provisions of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 are essential if the intention of the present exemption to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 is to be maintained. The present exemption in the Excise Tariff Act was meant to apply only to genuine home-brewers, brewing in the home. On 10 April 1973, in debate on the Excise Tariff Bill (No. 2) 1973, Mr Chipp, the then member for Hotham, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . these Bills have the purpose of making beer produced in the home for non-commercial purposes exempt from duty . . . The proposal is to allow beer to be produced or brewed in a home without the payment of excise . . . The Opposition supports this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA>On 11 April 1973 the then Attorney-General and Minister for Customs and Excise, Senator Murphy, said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment contained in the Bill now before the Senate makes provision for beer produced in the home for non-commercial purposes to be exempt from excise duty.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, the intention of that legislation was to restrict the exemption to excise to in-the-home-brewers. The essential difference between the so-called micro-brewers on the commercial side is the timing of the payment for the product. The end product is the same: excise has to be paid for beer greater than the prescribed alcohol content. In micro-brewing, the customer pays for the ingredients, the use of the premises and the profit component of the owner of the micro-brewing. In the case of a purchase from a licensed outlet, the customer is paying for exactly the same things, but not separately. In addition, he is paying tax, excise and a much greater employment component. These brew-on-premise organisations have been carefully designed in such a way as to market their beer to circumvent the excise provisions of the act. They are nothing more than an attempt to rort the act, and they should be treated that way before the revenue lost to the government and the effect on many thousands of legitimate small business owners and their employees throughout Australia is felt in a major way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the government revenue side, the Amateur Brew on Premise Association of Australia, in its paper `Economic Social Benefits of Brew on Premises', goes to great lengths to  make a case that the effect will be minimal or negligible on government revenue. At the same time, it makes the case for the potential for growth in the industry. The case it makes, however, is full of false, spurious and misleading assumptions&mdash;some of which I imagine the opposition will use. It has already used them. There is no doubt that some of the information in that paper was used in the speech of the shadow minister for manufacturing and service industries, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABOPA says that growth projections it has made are conservative, at less than 60 per cent that of Canada. There is no proper basis for that argument. It admits itself that it is a conservative argument. I argue that growth would be at least that of Canada. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brew Kettle, a Canadian micro-brewery operator, has an Australian franchisor who said in June 1993 that he expects this style of home-brewing to take off in Australia just as it has in Canada. That being so, in 1998 we would see 260 outlets in Australia, using the ABOPA growth figures. In 10 years time, there will be at least 1,500 of these shops. There could be many more shops, considering that there are now 6,452 hotels, 3,484 liquor stores, 8,992 licensed restaurants, 6,225 licensed clubs and other categories of licensed outlets, making a total of 29,316 licensed liquor outlets&mdash;all of them paying excise, wholesale sales tax and state licence fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABOPA further assumes that each of its outlets will sell eight by 48 litres of beer, 300 days a year. That is 115,200 litres for each outlet. It says in its submission paper that it will charge $15 for 24 by 375 millilitres or nine litres. It says that each shop will produce $230,400 gross turnover per annum. To produce that sort of turnover, each shop will have to sell 15,360 of those 24 by 375 millilitre bottles or 138,240 litres&mdash;not the 115,200 litres as is claimed in its paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABOPA further makes certain assumptions as to where its customers will come from. These assumptions were repeated by the shadow minister tonight. A total of 30 per cent would come from current house-brewers, 20 per cent from import beer drinkers, 10 per cent from new beer drinkers and 40 per cent from customers of commercial production. Bearing in mind that current home-brewers have their own equipment and have already gained the experience and knowledge required, it is unlikely that many of those people would be prepared to pay for what they already have. More realistically, it is estimated that only five per cent of brew-on-premise customers would come from that group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABOPA also assumes, once again for no good reason, that 20 per cent of its customers will come from drinkers of imported beer. But imported beer makes up less than half a per cent of Australian sales, and that still comes out of sales at retail outlets. Moreover, this class of drinker is buying expensive premium beers and is more than likely to continue to do so. Certainly a more realistic estimate would be that there would be a negligible draw of customers from this group to the brew on premise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABOPA also assumes that 10 per cent of its custom will come from new beer drinkers. Beer consumption per head is falling and has been for some time. ABOPA also says that people under 25 are least likely to use its brew on premise. But this is the most likely area to draw new drinkers from. Therefore, to be realistic, brew on premise could not expect more than two per cent of its custom from this group. That means that more than 90 per cent of its business will come from established commercial outlets&mdash;hotels, clubs, liquor stores and restaurants&mdash;those 29,000 licensed liquor outlets that are already paying excise, wholesale sales tax and state licence fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in 1998, using the ABOPA growth figures, but with realistic assumptions, there would be 260 shops each selling 138,000 litres&mdash;that is, a total of 36 million litres of beer annually. Ten years from now there will be at least 1,500 shops selling 207 million litres annually. Bearing in mind again that more than 90 per cent of this would come out of the present excisable area, the effect on revenue in today's terms would be to reduce government excise revenue by three per cent, which is 20 times more than the 0.14 per cent that ABOPA claims in its paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ten years from now, using the ABOPA growth pattern, there would be a reduction of 10 per cent in government revenue from excise on beer which, in today's terms, would amount to $110 million&mdash;a substantial cut in government revenue. That is not counting the loss in wholesale sales tax and state licence fees which would explode that figure to more than $200 million a year. At the same time, it would reduce sales at present outlets by $600 million per year and this would have a severe effect on the viability and the employment in all those smaller hotels, clubs, restaurants and liquor stores&mdash;the 29,000 outlets now paying excise, wholesale sales tax and state licence fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, ABOPA makes the claim that its proposals would increase employment, but it takes no account of the loss of employment in the present commercial outlets. If, as calculated, the effect on commercial outlets is 10 per cent of beer sales, after 10 years that industry&mdash;the brewing, the hotels and the clubs&mdash;could expect a drop in employment of a figure of that order. The loss of jobs would be in the tens of thousands in the liquor industry; at which time, ABOPA claims in its submission, it would be supplying five employees per shop. There would be a net loss of tens of thousands of jobs. The job losses would be skilled tradespeople and skilled shop assistants. It is self-evident that there is far greater employment needed to sell beer through the steps in the present brewing and marketing arrangements than there would be through this brew on premise set-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, I wonder what type of jobs this brew on premise will provide. ABOPA says in its paper about the economic and social benefits that they will be unskilled jobs. There will be five in a shop and over six years in 150 shops it will pay $33 million in wages. That is all in its submission; but that works out at $142 per employee. I wonder where that comes from and I wonder at the Liberal Party's backing of this proposal. Is it backing it because it sees it as a backdoor way into its $3 per hour youth wage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The non-regulatory nature of the brew on premise means that we will have under-age people brewing and purchasing beer legally. Now is the time for the government to put a stop to this underhanded attempt to get around the Excise Tariff Act. It is not a new tax. The intention of the exemption was for in-the-home-brewers, not for these commercial operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill maintains the intention of the purpose of the 1973 exemption. I urge all members to support this package of bills, and particularly this one. Specifically, I ask those opposite to appraise critically the sort of tripe that ABOPA, the Amateur Brew on Premise Association of Australia, has handed to it in this paper on the economic and social benefits of brewing on premise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In entering this debate on the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill and cognate bills, I want to draw the attention of the House to the speakers list. I can only assume that it was drawn up in the whip's office&mdash;probably that of the government whip. This debate is listed, in the final stage, as `Excuse Tariff Amendment No. 2 Bill'. I think it is a very poor excuse for good government as far as the increases in this bill are concerned. One might wonder whether that was deliberate or whether it was telling the facts as they are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, there are quite a few aspects I would like to comment on within this wide ranging bill. I will begin by commenting on behalf of the National Party of Australia and its rural constituency. This particular increase in charges is once again going to affect the country people more than any other sector of the community. I say this because the cost of fuel, as has been demonstrated earlier by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), will be felt mainly in the outlying areas where transport is essential and for which there is no alternative. These charges&mdash;in addition to the normal motoring charges and the cost of business&mdash;will be felt right throughout the rural community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In mentioning the rural constituency, I want to make a reference to a press release put out by Senator Reynolds in North Queensland where she is drawing a comparison&mdash;I think it was unfair because it then has racial overtones&mdash;between the difference in government funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and the rural community. I happen to know from a debate we had a few weeks ago that $1.3 billion is made available to ATSIC, either by direct grant or by way of supplementary programs. I believe the amount paid to the rural industry is some $914.6 million. The bulk of that represents a refund of excise charges on the farming sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who would suggest that that is a subsidy or payment to the rural industry is being deliberately misleading. I am not sure what part of that amount of $914.6 million is regarded as a rebate, but I notice that within this bill $898 million was rebated to registered users in 1992-93, and there are many other registered users apart from the rural industry. I take exception to people being misleading, in a public sense, about the way in which the impact of the increase in excise is going to be felt. It is going to be felt by the farming and rural communities more than any other. I suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that your electorate would be one that would feel the impact because it is devoted basically to primary production and has many outlying districts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I vigorously dispute this mischievous claim that is circulating that farmers are receiving a greater rebate, a greater handout, from this government than anyone else, because they have to pay the amount before they get a rebate. It is absolutely misleading to suggest that it is a form of government charity. The rebate system replaces an exemption system. I believe that, while that exemption worked fairly well, there were areas of abuse. However, as far as simplicity is concerned, that system of exemption had a lot to recommend it over the current arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cite a particular example of what this current arrangement means to a rural producer. In October last year, I became aware of a constituent farmer whose mother had been keeping the farm accounts right up until her death from cancer. She maintained, as her only continuing grip on life, her grip on those books and she never actually fed out the information for somebody else to follow. So, when she died, the daughter-in-law took over keeping the books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a necessity in keeping the books to lodge the accounts for diesel fuel for rebate purposes. She did it quite honestly and an honest mistake was made. In this regard, I thought I could write to Mr Brian Docherty, a collector of the Australian Customs Service, drawing his attention to the particular problem, detailing what had happened and explaining the desire of the daughter-in-law to get details of past rebates so that she could follow precisely where she was. Even at that stage a second error was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been back to the department and minister involved and outlined the particular problems, but at no stage have I received any satisfactory answer to what I believe was an innocent error. I am greatly offended that, even having written to the then Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs, the present Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall), and having received a reply on 19 January, the minister washed his hands completely of the case and said that there was no way in which he could intervene. He said it was the responsibility of the person, even in these circumstances, to be absolutely correct in his or her application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Admittedly, the self-assessment nature of the scheme confers the benefit when one mistake is made; and, admittedly, two quite innocent mistakes have been made. So I got no joy whatsoever from the minister. I then took the matter to the ombudsman who, in a two-page letter, said that the assessments et cetera were made `in accordance with the act'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to highlight the high degree of bureaucratisation of the whole scheme. One wonders whether the expense of running this scheme in such a manner is justified when one sees an incapacity within the act, the department, the minister and the ombudsman to rectify a simple mistake. When we got down to the last gasp, the real irony of matter was that, while the penalty still applied, another error was found in favour of my constituent which reduced the amount owing. Still and all, that is indicative of the manner in which the bureaucracy is ruining the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now mention some of the other offensive aspects of the bill. At the last election, the Australian Labor Party said there would be no new taxes and that personal tax cuts were in law. Yet in the August budget we see the imposition of another tax through the one per cent administration charge. It might be argued that that amount was recommended by the Auditor-General, which would be the first time the government has taken any notice of the Auditor-General. Earlier this year the Auditor-General highlighted the fact that the national debt was a great deal larger than the government had contemplated. Normally, this charge would bring in $9 million against an administration cost of some $4 million or $5 million. By any stretch of the imagination, that is a new tax. The cost recovery should have meant that this charge was 0.5 per cent and not one per cent, as it is at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's amendment is justifiable in striking that charge from the record because the government had no mandate to introduce it. It is a huge imposition.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is with a heavy heart that I rise tonight on a very serious matter that has enraged many residents of my electorate of Cowan. I am sure that my colleagues have also been inundated with messages from constituents saddened by this government's handling of our most sacred occasion&mdash;an occasion of national importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are few days in Australia that instil such a deep sense of melancholy and humility in Australians as Armistice Day. On that day, Australians young and old give thanks and pay homage to the many men and women who courageously gave their lives in pursuit of the principles of democracy and freedom when they were threatened by foes on a far distant shore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Armistice Day will be a particularly unique one with the entombment of Australia's own Unknown Soldier. The date of 11 November 1993 has been marked as a national day of importance, and correctly so. However, I am personally distressed and saddened by the decision to allow the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to be the chief pallbearer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this issue I ask all honourable members to think beyond personal and party discipline to ensure that this day is a truly national day&mdash;a day for all Australians to give thanks and to show their respect. It should not be turned into a day of politics, as I am afraid that it will be if we allow the Prime Minister the responsibility of being the chief pallbearer&mdash;a Prime Minister who has single-handedly attempted to recklessly destroy and denigrate our country's finest institution and national symbols. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I caution my comments because we must protect this important and historical event from political manipulation. But, by the same token, I will not let my silence on this issue be construed as support. Mr Neville Rossiter of Greenwood wrote to me yesterday about the issue. On issues such as this, we should listen attentively to the opinions of our constituents. Mr Neville Rossiter of Greenwood writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Richard Evans . . . I wish to protest strongly about the Prime Minister Paul Keating being chief pallbearer at the funeral procession of the unknown soldier. I was wounded seriously in action in Vietnam in 1970 and for a person like Paul Keating whose Government showed nothing but contempt and created a division between Australians during the Vietnam War, I regard this as an absolute insult of the highest order. Please do something about it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not my words; they are the words of an Australian who knows of horror and sacrifice of war. Those thoughts and sentiments are echoed around Australia this evening. When we examine who the other five pallbearers are on this occasion&mdash;the Chief of the Defence Force Staff, the chief of each of the services, and the Vice-Chairman of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission&mdash;the decision to make the Prime Minister the chief pallbearer leaves me very concerned. The Prime Minister should take his rightful and respected position behind the official mourner, the Governor-General, in the company of other parliamentary and political leaders, the  mayors of two French cities which were located on the western front and representatives of national veterans and widow organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge all Australians who feel anguished by the decision to allow the Prime Minister to be the chief pallbearer on this very important and sacred occasion to voice their concerns and to write to their local members, be they Liberal or Labor members of parliament, in the strongest terms. We should not take the risk of undermining the integrity of such a sacred occasion by ignoring the concern in the community of the prime role and responsibility extended to the Prime Minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The NRMA is notorious concerning the ways in which it misuses its members' funds. If NRMA members want some strict supervision exercised in their interests, then they will get out their ballot papers from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Open Road</EMPHASIS> and vote for the six Motorist Action Group candidates&mdash;Jane Singleton, Richard Talbot, Geoff Lawson, Pat O'Shane, Jim Morris and Philip Laird. Honourable members will recall the appalling campaign by the NRMA against a former duly elected director, Mr David Parker. Mr Parker lost favour with the inner clique of the NRMA after 1985 and was subjected to a campaign of vilification, isolation, humiliation and intimidation. The hounding of David Parker continued until the NRMA bosses finally got rid of him, but at a cost to members of over $2 million. The NRMA carried a vote of no-confidence in Mr Parker, called a special meeting of the NRMA and on 15 August 1988 removed him from the council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Parker later took action in the Supreme Court claiming that directors of the NRMA had received improper payments totalling almost a half a million dollars between 1974 and 1985. The scam to arrange these improper payments was exposed by David Parker. The NRMA articles of association provided for the remuneration of directors. Rather than increase that remuneration in an honest and open way, the NRMA chose to create a bogus subsidiary body called the Insurance Liaison Committee. It performed no function other than to allow the concealment of the nature and purpose of the remuneration paid to directors of the NRMA. Between 1954 and 1967 the minutes of the insurance arm of the NRMA recorded only seven references to the ILC. After 1967, there were no references at all. The ILC kept no minutes of its own. It made no reports to the insurance arm. In fact, it did not exist in any meaningful way. However, directors of the NRMA drew remuneration as directors of the ILC. No resolution was ever passed by the NRMA board to appoint directors to the ILC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRMA became the ultimate exclusive and privileged club for its bosses. It became a source of private indulgence for those who controlled it. The remarkable thing is that these people thought that they were above criticism. Anyone who opposed them threatened the comfort of their existence and had to be resisted. The NRMA could even finance partisan political campaigns which suited the political inclinations of its bosses. Mr Parker appealed against the failure of his action before the Supreme Court, in which he had claimed that NRMA directors had received improper payments. The court of appeal dismissed his appeal. However, in a dissenting judgment, the president of the court of appeal, Justice Michael Kirby, an outstanding jurist, a man of unquestioned integrity, a great democrat and a renowned Australian, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was the appellant's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, David Parker&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">case that when he raised his concerns as a director about the lawfulness of such payments he was met at first with indifference and then, when he persisted, with resistance, opposition, obfuscation and finally the unlawful oppression for which he was entitled to relief.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that judges should support `corporate gadflies' who attempt to correct unlawful and oppressive conduct by company directors. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The vigilant intervention of the courts is necessary to protect the integrity of companies and to enforce scrupulous conduct on the part of directors.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Kirby found that procedures adopted by the NRMA were oppressive and unfair. About David Parker, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . his cause was at no time one for personal gain or for his own financial profit.</PARA>
<PARA>The NRMA bosses sought to intimidate and punish David Parker by a resolution of no-confidence and by terminating his tenure as a director of three of the NRMA's subsidiaries. These are precisely the same tactics used by the NRMA against the duly elected director, Richard Talbot. The leopard has not changed its spots. The NRMA could be a practical model expressing the cooperative side of the human character. It has almost two million members in a major corporate structure. However, its comfortable closeted existence bred a level of arrogance and self-indulgence seldom seen on such a scale for a mutual type organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Motorist Action Group directors have been vigilant, courageous and thorough in their promotion and defence of the interests of NRMA members. They have pursued this course, often at considerable cost to themselves and in the face of public abuse and attempts at personal humiliation. The MAG directors have been responsible for a number of changes in the way the NRMA operates, all to the advantage of members. They have been able to resist the introduction of changes that would have been to the disadvantage of members. The MAG directors deserve our continuing support and I urge members to take out their ballot papers and vote for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the most frustrating features of federal politics, apart from hearing letters written by one's aunt, is to see a responsible government such as ours allocate funds on perceived needs to the states only to see the states fail to recognise the same priorities as we do. They take the money and they do not spend it. There are many examples in education&mdash;we spoke about that in the debate last night&mdash;roads, housing and health; and, of course, the list goes on. But it is health I want to speak on this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was most concerned to hear the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) advise this House on Tuesday evening of the proposal to build a new hospital at Bowral on the Southern Highlands at a suggested cost of $90 million. I was concerned because in my own electorate the town of Maitland has been waiting six years for its hospital to be refurbished. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UU5">Mr HORNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Six years of conservative government. I would like to take the House through the history of the Maitland hospital development. The Maitland hospital redevelopment commenced under the Unsworth Labor government in 1986, when Peter Anderson, the Minister for Health, proposed a five-stage program over eight years at the cost of $24 million. At that stage, $1 million was expended on planning and design work for the project. The rise of Nick Greiner and his government in May 1988 resulted in the project stalling. There was no budget allocation to the redevelopment between 1988 and 1992, despite the fact that the Maitland hospital redevelopment was listed as No. 1 priority in the Hunter and No. 3 in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that at this time Albury, Lismore and Wagga hospitals were not even listed as priorities, yet since that time have received $22 million, $36 million and $14 million respectively in the New South Wales budget last month, to which this federal government was the major contributor, for health expenditure. More interestingly, Bowral Hospital, which is in the New South Wales Premier's electorate of the Southern Highlands, has been given a substantial Treasury loan for a major redevelopment. One would be forgiven for feeling that maybe there is an election coming on in New South Wales and, of course, the Premier is under siege in his own seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same sense of unease has given rise to the Premier reigniting the Maitland redevelopment&mdash;this six-year-old promise. An amount of $5 million has been given to it this year. For what? To pull down the existing nurses home. That is what the people of Maitland get as their share of the contribution of federal funding to health in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to the delay of six years, we find that the original cost of $32 million has now blown out to $35 million. Seventeen per cent of this project has been allocated this year, as I indicated, to demolish the old nurses home. For six years, under the premiership of Greiner and now Fahey, not a sod of soil has been turned on this redevelopment. On the present rate of allocation, and, Lord forbid, under a coalition government, the year 2000 Olympics in Sydney will have come and gone while the Maitland Hospital redevelopment struggles on to complete its marathon journey. Yet at an estimates hearing in Sydney today, the state minister, Ron Phillips, advised that he will be looking to privatise pathology and radiography services&mdash;the start of the privatisation of the health system in New South Wales. However, last year the New South Wales government underspent its health budget by $82 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by returning to where I started. One of the frustrating features of being a federal politician is undoubtedly this government allocating money for the needs of the people of Australia and having state governments such as that in New South Wales refusing to honour those priorities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

In fact, many who lost their lives with me never voted. They were young people who were conscripted or joined the services and went overseas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many areas of rural Australia are feeling the benefits of the federal Labor government's strategies to meet the challenge of erosion, salination and pollution. Through the ministerial portfolio of primary industries and energy, millions of dollars are being put to good use assisting collective communities and landowners to come to terms with and reverse the trend or solve their specific problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I visited an area in north-eastern Tasmania, at the Forester River near Scottsdale, to see first hand the extent of river erosion in that area. It is a problem of grave concern. Farmers in the area agree that past forestry and farming practices have exacerbated a once smaller problem. Too many trees were taken too close to the river's edge and this has caused the water table to rise. Swamps are appearing throughout the river flats. After such sudden heavy rain there is no soakage; thus the water can only run off causing the river to flood across the farmlands, resulting in major damage from erosion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ferguson, Sykes and Harris families have spent thousands of their own dollars trying to ease the flooding problem by building levy banks, planting trees and attempting to put the river back on course by pushing tonnes of rocks onto the river banks and into the riverbed. These families all agree that over the years landowners have cleared too much, logged the surrounding hills to extreme and generally raped the land. Thus, today, these people suffer incredible damage by just one inch of rain, let alone a deluge. And this particular area of Tasmania is prone to sudden deluges of rain. Acres of good topsoil have been washed away. Huge chunks of river banks are gone, changing the course of rushing flood waters&mdash;which, in themselves, shift hundreds of thousands of tonnes of stone, constantly washing the small bridges in the area away. However, the group near the Forester River is optimistic that it will be able to ease&mdash;and eventually halt&mdash;the progress of seasonal floods, thus returning the land along the river bank to its former rural glory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I discussed with them at that meeting the concept of the one billion trees project. Their biggest area of need seems to be in the acquisition of about 1,000 willows and native shrubs to hold the banks and thus give nature a chance to regenerate. Surveys and reports have been done and Steve Radcliffe, from the Brisbane Water Supply, said in his report that he thought it was one of the worst examples of that type of erosion that he had seen in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said that to begin resolving the problem, it would be necessary to exclude all stock from within 30 metres of each side of the river, then plant both sides with a mixture of native and willow trees. Five hundred to 1,000 trees would begin to solve the problem. With a cost of $2,500 to $5,000 this poses a financial burden on this small group in the Forester River area. That is where possibly a one billion trees program or landcare program would be able to assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem is typical of many similar problems facing rural Australia today due often to uninformed and poor farming practices on the land in past decades. It is gratifying to see a government that not only recognises there is a problem, but sets about doing something to rectify it through such programs as landcare and one billion trees. Now the regional development task force is at work and a rural development incentive scheme is on line. I not only speak highly of the efforts of those dedicated small regional groups, such as those at the Forester River in north-eastern Tasmania, but also urge others in this House to talk to their electors and advise them of these and other government initiatives towards assistance and change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a lot of angst generated tonight about the proposal for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to be a pallbearer at the burial of the Unknown Soldier. I think it is absolutely appropriate that the Prime Minister be a pallbearer. I see absolutely nothing wrong with that, though it seems to me to be a clear breach of protocol that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is not being given the opportunity as well. However, it is facile in the extreme for the opposition to blame the Prime Minister for this. The Prime Minister would have had no say in respect of pallbearers, and he would have agreed to it for the very best of reasons. I think the opposition should be directing its hostility elsewhere and not at the Prime Minister on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go on to the basis of my speech tonight, I want to congratulate the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) on his letter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I think it was on Tuesday&mdash;in respect of industry in Australia. I thought it was a well constructed letter. It was a very sound letter&mdash;I could have written it myself&mdash;and I think it indicates the honourable member for La Trobe is, at heart, a true socialist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I want to talk about the future of Australia because I think, while we wax eloquent about the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, we ought to be thinking about the future of this nation. I think it is a supreme irony that the Prime Minister claims that becoming a republic is the key to increasing our national independence and self-respect. Our national sovereignty has been declining, not increasing, in recent years. Our national sovereignty&mdash;that is to say, our ability as a people to influence the destiny of our country&mdash;is being compromised with each passing year. Whether or not we become a republic will make very little difference to this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When our problems are analysed, the underlying reason that we are in our present mess is that responsibility has been evaded, both at the personal level and the national level. There has been a wholesale flight from responsibility, coupled with what has been a massive growth of a grievance industry based on so-called rights. These rights are pursued using the highest moralistic language, but underlying this pursuit is the selfish drive for individual and sectional privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a narrow, focused pursuit undertaken without consideration of the consequences to the wider public. There is no national overview. No responsibilities are accepted for the wider good of the society which has to pay for these so-called rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As our economy declines, those in the grievance industry continue to build their empires and extract public money for the purpose of so doing. By doing this, they contribute to our economic decline while, through their various politically correct bodies and laws, they erode our democratic foundations. In the end, we will all suffer but they will continue to howl for their rights. It is possible to respect people who strongly disagree with our own views if they are prepared to accept the consequences of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, however, as is common nowadays, people urge sacrifices upon others but live very comfortably themselves and others bear the consequences of their so-called principles, it is nothing but hypocrisy. For example, there are those who mindlessly attack the mining industry, which is our major export earner, while living very comfortably themselves, often on the public payroll. If they had their way, very few mining ventures would proceed. Yet, by earning export dollars, the mining industry actually subsidises the very people who attack it. These people should ask themselves how much they themselves earn in exports. If it is nothing, as is overwhelmingly the case, they should carefully examine the consequences of compromising those activities which earn export dollars. They have a responsibility to the wider public to do so, but of course they have evaded responsibility. It is too hard. It might involve a bit of rigorous thinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say that I have been involved in the nuclear debate for many years.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government's handling of this situation has created uncertainty and division in Australian society. Despite the plethora of media statements and the release of the drafting instructions for the legislation there is still no certainty as to the legal implications which will flow from the final legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I made mention, this letter is dated 15 October. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public debate has in fact operated in a virtual vacuum, in that the community itself has never been allowed to make submissions to any appointed body on this question. Consultation has been confined to peak groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMEC which represents 70 mineral exploration and mining companies and 110 companies which provide goods and services to the mining industry, wishes to place on record the following concerns</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">i) That any Federal legislation must, without fear of any further challenge, validate all land titles issued in Australia to the current date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ii) That land management and allocation must remain a State Constitutional responsibility and the Federal Government not seek to interfere in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Commonwealth was formed, the Constitutional powers it was given were ceded from the States. Land administration and allocation was not ceded at that time and the Commonwealth therefore does not have a role in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">iii) It follows therefore that the reported choice of jurisdiction under which native title may be heard cannot be on the basis of either State or Commonwealth. Clearly it must be at the State level if such a process is indeed eventually adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mining industry has as its first priority, the requirement that mining companies must be able to access land under whatever title on practical terms and conditions to explore for and to develop the nation's mineral resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As these mineral resources are for the most part held as community property under the concept of Crown ownership of minerals, it follows that there can be no formal or de facto ability for any landholder to veto access or development of the community's resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been a problem feature of the industry's activities in the Northern Territory on Aboriginal land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On that subject, after 17 years of Federal imposed Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory it can be clearly seen that the system which applies to mineral exploration and mineral development in this area just does not work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statistics speak for themselves and show that on Aboriginal land over the 17 year period, out of 574 applications made for exploration licences 34 have been granted. In Western Australia in any week and particularly using the factual figures for 1992/93, 21 exploration licences are granted and in the annual period approximately 1,100 exploration licences were granted. Without exploration there will be no new mines developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are disturbing similarities between the Aboriginal land rights concept in the Northern Territory and the way in which native title will affect Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Commonwealth preferred method of dealing with native title in Australia results in a situation in Western Australia similar to that in the Northern Territory under Aboriginal land rights, then this nation is headed for an even bigger economic disaster than we are currently facing.</PARA>
<PARA>This evening on the television we viewed the backbenchers in the Labor Party expressing their concern about the unemployment crisis in this country. Yet, at the same time, we are facing some very substantial difficulties in the one industry&mdash;particularly in Western Australia, it provides the economic root for six out of 10 jobs&mdash;that is going to provide an enormous fillip for economic recovery in Australia. The mining industry in Western Australia is of critical importance to the economic recovery of Australia. It ought to be considered a little more closely and a little more importantly by those opposite when they consider the implications of the Mabo legislation on the mining industry in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of comments on two of the threads that have been running through the discussions in this adjournment debate. Firstly, I want to make some comments, following on the comments of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), on the ceremony for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier that is about to occur. The reason government members were particularly aggrieved by the comments by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) is that it was he who introduced a fairly vicious political contribution into the consideration of this issue. For the last three years this government has been in charge of organising ceremonies around the world commemorating many historical events in the First World War and the Second World War, particularly the Gallipoli campaign, the fall of Singapore and, most recently, the ceremonies marking the 75th anniversary of the western front.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On every occasion those activities and ceremonies were organised in a bipartisan way. There has been absolutely no attempt by this government to score any political points from this process. Opposition members have been involved in all of those ceremonies. Each ceremony has been a national ceremony, not a party political ceremony. It is for that reason that we took particular offence at the comments of the honourable member for Cowan. The comments of the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) were more balanced, reasonable and rational, and we have no disagreement with the point that they were making, that is, within the process of determining who should be pallbearers for this ceremony, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) should have been considered because it is not the desire of the government, in any way, to utilise this ceremony for party political purposes. It is not a political process; it is a ceremony of national significance. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should be one of the pallbearers in this process because, as the head of the elected government of this country, he represents all the citizens of this country in his role as Prime Minister. I think it is very unfortunate that the honourable member for Cowan introduced a party political element into the consideration of this vital national ceremony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly disturbed about that because I participated as a member of a parliamentary delegation to Europe, along with my good friend and colleague the member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland). We had the great honour to visit a number of Commonwealth war graves in Europe. We also visited the Menin Gate in the city of Ypres where, every night since 1919 or 1920, there has been a ceremony marking the great loss of life that occurred in and around that city in the First World War. At 8 o'clock one evening we participated in a bipartisan way in that ceremony at the Menin Gate. Three of the local constabulary participate by playing the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Last Post</EMPHASIS>, and there is a very moving ceremony to mark the massive sacrifice and loss of life at Ypres of the men and women from the Commonwealth and from around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members opposite will remember, it was just a few weeks ago that members of the government and the opposition participated in a ceremony at the Menin Gate when a new plaque was unveiled by the Governor-General, the Hon. Bill Hayden. So on no occasion in any of these events has there been a party political attempt to manipulate the ceremonies. These are ceremonies of national significance. We are honoured that we have the opportunity to recognise the great sacrifice of all of those men and women in the First World War, on the 75th anniversary of that great tragedy, by having the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier&mdash;an unknown soldier brought back from the fields of Europe to be laid at rest here in Canberra. Honourable members can be assured that this is not a party political process, and we are determined to make sure that it is recognised in a national way. </PARA>

I have listened to all the speeches on this. I did not intend to say anything about it&mdash;and the honourable member for Bennelong does make a good point&mdash;but most certainly many of us on this side of the House were offended by the comments of the honourable member for Cowan. Having been a member of this place for 10 years, I know for a fact that, if the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is not there as a pallbearer, we will have nothing but criticism from the opposition. The Prime Minister is in a no-win situation. If he is there as a pallbearer he will be criticised, and if he is not there as a pallbearer he will be criticised. That is all I want to say on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am constantly amazed when opposition members stand up here and read out so-called letters from their constituents. I sometimes wonder who the author is of those letters. I really want to talk this evening about a topic that I have mentioned before. I did not think I would have to stand up at such a time to make a speech on this matter, but I am concerned about the non-recognition by Australia of the sovereign state of Macedonia. As you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and other honourable members know, Macedonia meets all the requirements for international recognition. It is a sovereign state which, under international law, meets all the requirements. Yet Australia and many other states, for reasons best known to themselves, refuse to recognise Macedonia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Macedonia is now a member of the United Nations and 34 states in the world recognise Macedonia. Unfortunately, Australia, with its large population of people from Macedonia, still has not recognised Macedonia. I have the honour of representing the largest concentration of Macedonians in any electorate in Australia. More Macedonians reside in the federal electorate of Throsby than in any other electorate. But this in no way influences my strong support of and belief in its independence under the name Macedonia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support it because I believe in international law. I support it because I believe in the sovereignty of states. I know that Macedonia meets all the requirements for recognition. I do not want to say that it is because of Greek influence that Macedonia has not been recognised, but I must say that I am concerned that after the result of the recent election in Greece there may be a much more nationalistic viewpoint, and this may even further delay the recognition of Macedonia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that no undue influence is being brought on the Australian government; I would not for a moment suggest that there was. We have a duty to recognise Macedonia, as we have recognised so many other states. We have recognised other states that once were part of the former country of Yugoslavia. We were amongst the first to recognise the new independent states of the former Soviet Union. For the life of me, I do not see why Australia does not for once take the lead in international affairs and become the 35th country to recognise the country of Macedonia, under the name of Macedonia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At 12.42 a.m. I take the opportunity afforded by the government's mismanagement of the House's business to make a few remarks about the Turnbull committee and its report that was recently brought down in response to terms of reference which were to provide the Australian community with an outline of the means by which in a minimalist way Australia could convert from a constitutional monarchy to a republic. In the last couple of days we have had some evidence of the Turnbull committee's work, when the frustrations of its members were directed at members of the coalition with some personal abuse in respect of our attitudes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say to the members of the Turnbull committee that they were to provide a means by which a republic could be created in Australia, and in that task they have notably and miserably failed. The Labor Party's plan now is to bury the idea for six months to try to take the imprint of the paws of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) off the republican blueprint. The fact is that, rather than going into hibernation, those who wish to pursue a republic have a very daunting task ahead of them. The truth is that there is no such thing as a simple and minimalist means to achieve a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three big issues remaining outstanding upon the completion of the Turnbull report, as they were outstanding at the start of the Turnbull committee's work. Perhaps the easiest issue to address is the means by which the head of state may be appointed. It is easy in the sense that there are a number of options, including an election by members of the federal parliament.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Cobb" NAMEID="MF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will come back to cost in a moment. The problem with that is that when members of the public are asked how they want to be involved in the election of a president, they say that they would like to elect the president themselves. The alternatives are politically unacceptable to the Australian electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major problem is how we deal with the states. From the Turnbull committee we had a recommendation or a canvassing of options which discloses the fact that we cannot have a republic in Australia unless we have the consent of each and every one of the states. In fact, so bizarre were the options recommended that Mr Turnbull had to admit as much at the National Press Club. Under one of the options canvassed by the Turnbull committee we could have a situation where a visiting head of state would be welcomed by the republican president on one day, and as he departed our fine shores the next day he would be seen off by the 2IC who, under one of the Turnbull options, would be a representative of the constitutional monarch, being the governor of one of the states. We would have an absolutely absurd situation which would make Australia a laughing stock internationally for having such constitutional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue which remains completely unresolved as a result of the works of the Turnbull committee goes to the powers of the head of state. This is a difficult issue. If we attempt to codify the powers of the head of state, it is technically difficult; it is technically difficult not on my words, but on the words of many of the noted authorities who have looked at this issue for many years. Basically, the problem is that we will codify and end up with too many powers or too few powers. The problem that arises out of that is that the Labor Party would never accept a codification of the powers used by the head of state back in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Turnbull committee is really fair dinkum about wanting Australia to convert to a republic, instead of setting its sights on the Liberal Party it ought to be asking the Labor Party caucus whether or not it is prepared to accept what happened in 1975 and finally and manfully admit that it was wrong in 1975, and has been for the last 18 years. The Turnbull committee, instead of providing a path to a future republic, has simply revealed the complexities of the matter and has failed to provide any sensible responses to those who want to see Australia turned into a republic. The Turnbull committee then had the cheek to turn its frustrations on the coalition. As far as I am concerned, we have a good constitution. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was interesting. I was sitting in my office watching the goings on in the Senate. If ever we needed a change to the parliamentary system, it is over there in the Senate at the moment. It is a shambles, and it has been brought about by the members of the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what stirred my blood was the republic issue. I would like to remind the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) of a survey that was taken in our area&mdash;very close to the honourable member's electorate. This survey showed that 60 per cent of people favoured a republic. Significantly, 43 per cent of Liberal and National Party voters said that they favoured a republic. Support for a republic amongst ALP voters was 81.9 per cent. The survey was conducted in June and covered 3,640 electors; 51 per cent said that their voting preference was for the Liberal and National Parties, and 21.5 per cent said that they voted Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The largest support&mdash;44 per cent&mdash;was for Australia staying in the Commonwealth as a republic. Nearly 15 per cent of those polled wanted Australia to become a republic outside the Commonwealth. That was a total of 58.8 per cent&mdash;about 60 per cent of this huge number of people. These numbers were quite overwhelming. An overwhelming number&mdash;76 per cent&mdash;wanted the president to be chosen by the people. Most of the people polled&mdash;51 per cent&mdash;wanted the role to be ceremonial. So, 76 per cent wanted the president to be chosen by the people. At present our Governor-General is not chosen by the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than 30 per cent of people said that they thought a change to a republic would bring a lot of social division. The biggest support for a republic was in the 25 to 39 age group&mdash;76.7 per cent&mdash;followed by the 18 to 24 age group with 71.3 per cent. This is quite a huge percentage of people. In the 40 to 50 age group we had 67 per cent in favour, and in the 55 plus age group we had 46.4 per cent. We can see where the support comes from&mdash;in the older ages. That is understandable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where did this great survey come from? I was quite shocked when I read these results. Who did the survey? It was done&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;by the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), one of the opposition's own people. This was a Liberal Party survey backing a republic. This is astounding stuff. This is someone from the Liberal Party who actually surveyed his own electorate and this is the result he has received. Here he is. He did a great job. This was in that fabulous local paper the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mordialloc Chelsea News</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Isaacs said that he had circulated the results of the survey to all members of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party, including the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I hope that those opposite have all seen this. If they have, either they do not remember it or they have been fairly quiet about it. I must congratulate the honourable member because he has done a great job. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm trying to have the community's views looked at and assessed in the hope that as information comes out on the Government's position and the costs of change . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He said that the survey showed that most believed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at some stage in the future Australia will become a republic . . .</PARA>
<PARA>but stay within the Commonwealth. I thank the honourable member for Isaacs for doing such a good job on this survey and being so honest as to publicly publish the results. It is excellent work and I commend him for it. I only hope that other members of his party have read it. In particular, the honourable member for Flinders&mdash;who probably does not read his local paper&mdash;should have read this and should have known of those statistics. Even members of his own party are supporting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not had time yet to conduct one of these surveys, but no doubt I can get the survey paper from the honourable member for Isaacs. I am certain that the people of Dunkley would come up with the same results.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had an interesting assortment of issues tonight. In every speech, with every passing day in this place, it becomes clearer and clearer that, while we can talk about a republic or Mabo and all these other issues, the one thing that we really need to debate seriously is the abolition of state governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) here tonight because he has frequently pointed out in this chamber the shortcomings of the Kennett government in Victoria. Tonight I wish to talk about the Fahey government in New South Wales. Tonight we heard the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne), and the other night we heard the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), talking about the dreadful situation in New South Wales hospitals. The people of Bowral in my electorate have been fortunate that the Premier of New South Wales, John Fahey, who lives at Bowral, has just given $90 million for a new hospital. However, there is a slightly different situation at the other end of my electorate, at Camden. That was in John Fahey's seat a few years ago&mdash;indeed, he used to live there&mdash;but he seems to have forgotten about the people of Camden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Camden is part of the fastest growing area in New South Wales. It also has the youngest population, with 50 per cent under the age of 20. It is the population with the highest percentage of people under the age of five. But what did the Liberal government of New South Wales do? It closed the children's ward at Camden hospital. What an absolute disgrace. Not only that, but the maternity ward is also in a serious situation. Sometimes there are 28 patients with only one nurse on duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nurses were so distressed and worried that they went to their union. They were scared stiff of complaining in case they lost their jobs, but they were scared stiff not to complain because it could result in someone's life being lost. It has come to the stage where they are running fetes and cake stalls to raise enough money to keep the hospital going. This is all because of the outrageous cost cutting by the New South Wales government&mdash;in spite of the fact that the Commonwealth government is generous to New South Wales, as it is to all the states, when it comes to funding for health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am talking here about the same Premier who broke the world high jump record in Monte Carlo when the host city for the Olympic Games was announced. While all honourable members would support the idea of the Olympic Games being held in Sydney, that does not mean that we should have to go without basic health and education services in our regions. It is about time that the people of Camden, and other parts of New South Wales for that matter, had an olympic standard hospital service. Mr Fahey is very keen to take the political credit for winning the games, but when it comes to funding them, as we saw this week, that is a little different. I am sure that he will come crying crocodile tears to the federal government, holding his hand out for more money, when the going gets a bit tougher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard nonsense coming from Western Australia about Mabo. It is as though the Western Australian government sees itself as the last bastion of white supremacy, the way it has been carrying on. Having lived there myself in the 1970s, that does not surprise me. Obviously, things have not changed in Western Australia from the time when the present Premier's father was the Premier. It emphasises what I set out to say: that state governments are useless. They exist because the constitution was written by tory lawyers in the 1890s, giving certain rights to the states. It is now the 1990s&mdash;100 years on&mdash;and I would like to think that this country could truly become one nation; that by the year 2001, a hundred years after Federation, we would become one nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way we can do that is by having a sensible system of government&mdash;a national government with local or regional governments but without state governments, their petty infighting, the waste and duplication and ridiculous policies. They have lost credibility and their situation will continue to deteriorate over the next few years. We would be much better off without them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have talked to people throughout the community&mdash;Liberal, Labor, Catholic, Protestant&mdash;and any sensible, honest person would agree that we have too many spheres of government.

Neil Brown, spoke for some hours while matters of legislation were being decided in the Senate late at night. In the course of his remarks, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) was minded to say, he was talking about something which he took quite seriously. Even though it means spending some time on my feet, it is a matter of seriousness that I wish to address tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the honour and pleasure of attending this evening in the Kings Hall of the old Parliament House the National Young Retail Executive of the Year awards. I take this occasion to congratulate the national winner, Miss Joanna Farrell, from Western Australia, and the runner-up from New South Wales, Miss Christen Bevan&mdash;the winner having worked for Myer and the runner-up being an employee of David Jones. I congratulate the other state finalists: Priscilla Gray from Victoria, Kate Martin from South Australia, Kieren Vogel from Queensland and Rowena Watson from Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The occasion reminded me of the important role that the retail trade plays in this nation and of its importance to vocational education and training. Employers in this country are concentrated in the service industries and small business. If our vocational education and training system does not reflect the fact that that is where the majority of employers are, that system will not work. For example, 28 per cent of employers are in the retail sector, compared with 15 per cent of wage and salary earners. Two-thirds of those employers employ less than five employees. In addition to that, two-thirds of managers in this country are responsible for small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia today two out of three jobs held by teenagers are in only three industries&mdash;that is, in the wholesale and retail trade; in finance, property and business services; and in recreation, personnel and other services. Those same industries account for some 40 per cent of total employment. They employ more than half of school leavers and over 80 per cent of all employed students. In fact, 94 per cent of all jobs in these industries are in the private sector and 50 per cent of them are in firms which employ less than 20 employees. These firms are actually youth intensive in their employment practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the vocational education and training system in Australia and asks whether that system meets that particular market and the reality of that industry description in Australia, then one has to say that, unless that system is flexible and responsive to industry, it is likely to be a failure. A number of people from industry told me tonight that we have an employment and vocational training system which is not sufficiently flexible or responsive to industry to be able to provide adequate training, future jobs and growth for young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final chapter of Paul Kelly's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The End of Certainty</EMPHASIS>, he remarks that what he describes as the five principles of the Australian settlement have passed and that we are leading to a new era in Australia. Amongst those principles were state paternalism and wage arbitration. Yet when we look at the so-called training reform agenda in this country we will see that state paternalism through the top-down bureaucratic, centralist control of training remains a hallmark of that system. It is ironic that the system implemented under the conceptualisation of the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, now the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), goes against that which it is said this Labor Party has been working against in state paternalism. In terms of wage arbitration&mdash;a system which ties into trainee wages&mdash;the training system itself would seem to be, ironically, contrary to the diminution and the ending of that principle of the Australian settlement, namely, the wage arbitration system. So the whole irony of training and education in Australia is contrary to these principles.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
