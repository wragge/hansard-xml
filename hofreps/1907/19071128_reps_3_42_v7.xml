                        <para>- Last night the honorable member was good enough to mention this matter to me, and this morning I asked for a report, though in recent reports <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth,</inline> Smith has referred to the condition of the natives in employment in general terms of approval. He had called attention to the fact that there had been an undue amount of sickness among carriers, but, on inquiry it had been discovered that the condition of the rest houses had been allowed to become insanitary, with the result that dysentery had become prevalent. The insanitary condition has been removed. That appears to have been the only sickness to which he has recently called attention. </para>

I desire to know what action is being taken in Sydney for completing the metallic circuit and underground tunnel, because for  years the telephone service has been affected seriously by the induction from the electric tramway service. The suffering has lasted for a long time, and I want to know what steps have been, or are going to be taken to complete the metallic circuit and underground tunnel ? </para>

                            <para>-Yes. I have endeavoured to meet what I regard as the well-grounded complaints of honorable members by extending the distance for the minimum charge&#39; from one mile to two miles, and also by making an additional charge of  10s.  for every quarter of a mile or fraction thereof, and  20s.  for every additional half-mile. That will, I think, meet the majority of the cases. . If, how: ever, I find that it does not, we will make a further extension in order to make the charges equitable. </para>

                        <para>-  A project for a Bill for the purpose mentioned by the honorable member has been before the Imperial Parliament for some time, and I think that a first Bill has been laid before the House of Commons. The matter is doubtless being watched anxiously by the Agents-General for the States, and the Commonwealth Government will certainly have no objection to&#39; calling attention to the fact that in such a scheme it would be well to make provision for cool storage accommodation. As the honorable member is aware, however, in England that would only be open to private enterprise. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; on a statement being, published to the effect mentioned by the honorable member, we communicated by cable with the Philippines, and the statement has been confirmed. As I informed the House previously, the addition of boric acid or borun - which, is the preservative mainly used in Australian butter - renders it ineligible to be received in the Philippines, except in bond for the purpose of re-export. Owing to the honorable member for Capricornia, I was able to take advantage of the presence in Melbourne of the British Vice-Consul for Manila - who was passing through only a week or two ago - to discover from him the present position. We have a list of the preservatives authorized there, but they do not appear to be applicable to butter. In fact, salt seems the only preservative that may be used for the preservation of butter. It really appears as if the list of preservatives was drawn - either intentionally or unintentionally - in such a manner as practically to exclude Australian butter. Other regulations have also been employed in a severe manner in regard to live cattle, though that has not yet affected the Commonwealth. But we are communicating at some length in regard to these matters, because at present it seems almost impossible for shippers from Australia or elsewhere to be perfectly certain of the principle upon which the authorities in Manila intend to proceed. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Prime Minister read in the newspapers a statement made by the Premier of Victoria that if the suburban railways of Melbourne were electrified, ,&#163;200,000 would be the cost in duties to the State of Victoria? In view of this statement, will the Prime Minister say whether it is not a fact that three-fourths of the money obtained by such duties at- first goes back to the States, that a large amount is spent upon the Victorian branches of the Civil Service taken over by the Commonwealth from the State, and that a further amount of it is spent in new services, of which Victoria gets a fair share, and that the rest is also returned to the State. </para>

                            <para>- The question is, as  I  understand it, whether I will inform the migrating workmen that the protection afforded here is less than that obtaining in America. Well, I should be rather reluctant to do that, because I do not think that it would tell in our favour. I should prefer to show them that they have a better field of employment in Australia. </para>

The result of the decision of that Chamber is, of course, material in making a reply, because, should it be adverse, we shall have no interest in the question. I hesitate, under the circumstances, to comment upon the matter in any way until it comes practically before this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether he has taken into consideration - or, if he has not taken into consideration, will he endeavour to inform honorable members soon - the date when the House will be likely to rise for the Christmas holidays? I believe that if it were known what is in the mind of the Government - I do not, of course, want to bind them down to too definite a statement - more expedition in the transaction of business would result than is likely to be the case by leaving the matter indefinite. </para>

                        <para>- Having in view the fact that we are now dealing with one of the most contentious parts of the Tariff, covering a great variety of dutiable articles, or articles which may be made dutiable, one has to recognise that the slowness of the progress made is not a fair test of the general progress we hope to make. I still trust that not later than the second week of the month upon which we are about to enter, we shall have concluded our work upon the Tariff, and shall, therefore, be able to take our Christmas holidays. </para>

                    <para>. - The way has been cleared for our dealing with this item in an equitable manner since the declaration made last night by the Treasurer that he intended to take out the special exemption of items relating to the hat industry and the woollen industry generally. We ought to make no distinction between one trade and another regarding things which are in the nature of tools and preliminary requirements. All ought to be placed, as far as possible, on the same footing, and I take it that much of the cause of complaint on the part of the honorable member for Maranoa has now been removed. If I remember rightly he built up his complaint principally on the ground that certain industries we&#39;re being specially treated, and he urged that such treatment should also be extended to wool-washing machinery. </para>

                        <para>- Why it should be free when the machinery employed in other industries is taxed is beyond my comprehension. Why cannot the woollen industry, which has been highly protected, pay its fair quota to other industries which are making tools and machinery in the ordinary way ? There are some industries for which we cannot do very much, even though we do our best in the direction of protection. We cannot assist the currier and tanner very much with duties, since he manufactures largely for export. Why, therefore, should we tax his tools of trade, when we exempt the tools of trade required  in  an industry peculiarly susceptible to the benefits of protection, whatever they may be? I hope the Treasurer will agree to treat all  industries  alike so far as their tools of trade are concerned. I am sure I can appeal to the sense of . fairness of the honorable member for Maranoa not to press his views unduly if other trades are being treated exactly as the one in which he is interested. I have - a suggestion to make in connexion with this series of items. I think that there ought to be  a  uniform duty imposed on tools of trade, and, personally I should not be prepared to make it more than 15 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- No, it would be slightly protective. I take it that it is  a  fundamental principle even with protectionists that tools of trade should as far as possible be free. No better evidence of that could be found than in the very full list of exemptions provided for already. A duty of 15 per cent. on these lines would be slightly protective, and I think sufficiently protective having regard to the class: of articles in question. What I suggest is that we should make all these things subject to a uniform duty of 15 per cent., and that having done so we should strike out item 169, which appears to me to confer  a  very dangerous power on the Customs authorities. Under that item provision is made for the free admission of - </para>

                        <para>- I do not quite see how that could be. The Government control the business, they could bring down a resolution at any time they pleased, and it should not take twelve months or even twelve days to pass it through Parliament, unless the Ministry desired that it should take longer. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what the honorable gentleman is referring to, but since he has made that statement I wish to reply to an insulting interjection made just now by the Government Whip, to the effect that if the House is to rise, at Christmas the leader of the Opposition should be consulted and asked to say whether he would allow it. That is good, considering that the whole of yesterday&#39;s sitting was taken up entirely by speeches from honorable members on the Government side. </para>

                        <para>- Really, I think the Government might try to keep their own side in order, that we may get through with the consideration of the Tariff in decent time. The talk from the other side has been interminable during the whole of this week, and that is why we have not made better progress. In the circumstances, it is idle for the Government Whip to suggest that honorable members on this side are obstructing business. I am making a suggestion which, if agreed to by the Treasurer, would save a day&#39;s debate on this very debatable item. I suggest that he should agree to a uniform duty on all tools of trade and machines which in their nature are tools of trade. The honorable gentleman has already agreed to take out of the schedule at the end of the Tariff, specially favoured industries. In accordance with the suggestion I have made, I am prepared now to move that the General Tariff duty of 25 per cent. be left out with a view to inserting 15 per cent. with the understanding that that duty should be applied to all similar articles. </para>

                    <para>.- It is refreshing to hear the honorable member for Parramatta advocating protection, or objecting to put anything on the free list. I think the honorable member is &#39;under some misconception, and is assuming that this wool-scouring machinery is associated only with the woollen industry. It is only in the out-back districts that very, much wool-scouring is done at the present time. Owing to the fact that German and other continental buyers come into our markets and buy wool on the spot, very much less wool-scouring is done on the coast than used to be the case. It is in my electorate, and in the electorate of the honorable member for Maranoa, in districts 500 miles from the coast, that wool-scouring is chiefly carried on at the present time, in-order to lessen the weight of the wool that must be taken to ports. </para>

                        <para>- There is a great deal done at Coonamble, where there is a very large wool-scouring establishment, and also at Bourke. The wool-scouring done out back has increased, whilst it has decreased on the coast. Honorable members should remember that wool-scouring is not done by the big wool kings, but is an industry which in many cases is in the hands of working men, and is a large employer of bush labour. A good deal of the machinery used for wool-scouring may have been made locally, but some of the best is covered by patent rights, and could not be made here. There is a somewhat limited demand for it, and, therefore, its free admission would not interfere very much with the engineering trade. On the other band, a high duty on it would put a considerable tax on an important industry that is already fairly heavily taxed through the great cost of taking the machinery long distances inland, especially in Queensland and New South Wales. The machines are practically the tools of trade of an industry,  which gives considerable employment to labour in the back country, where the workers have few other advantages, and the Minister is right in proposing to put them on the free list. </para>

                    <para>. - These machines are made here. The patentee is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall,</inline> of my electorate. He has had the patent for the last thirty-eight years. I believe the patent has now run out. Messrs. Hall Bros. and Company have made 150 of the machines here. Previous to their competition the price of the imported machine was &#163;750. To-day the price is &#163;500- a reduction of &#163;250 through the establishment of the local industry. I stand here as a protectionist and as an advocate for the farmer, so that he may get his machinery cheap. I want the primary producers to share in the benefits of a protectionist Tariff. That result can be achieved by imposing a duty on imported machinery of this character. If the duty is removed the importer, who sits in Collins-street, will send home for more machinery, and the price will be put up.

Your machines have been in use on Toorale and Dunlop stations for some (20) twenty years, and the fact that they have not been superseded by other machines that have been put on the market as improved machines since then, and also that the wool from these properties scoured with your machines sells to the highest price in the London wool market every year, speaks for itself.

                <para class="block">Those letters are sufficient evidence that good machines can be made here.I have also shown that the local competition has reduced the price by&#163;250. There is no reason why the article should be put on the free list. I saw the machine working this morning, and have with me samples of the wool, scoured and unscoured, which honorable members can see. If such excellent work can be done by locally-made machines I cannot understand why the Treasurer wants to put the article on the free list. Out of the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500</inline> cost of the machine&#163;350 goes in labour. I am certain that when the Treasurer knows that the machine is being made here, and is doing good work, and that the pastoralists are satisfied with it, he will not persist in his proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - The machine referred to by the honorable member for Batman is, in all probability, a very good one, and cleans the wool well, but wool can be cleaned excellently with a&#39; stick. The cleaning will not give it quality. The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCaughey&#39;s</inline> wool brings more in the London market than does any one else&#39;s only shows that his stations are more suitable for sheep-raising than are other stations. He grows on his runs some of the best wool in the world. That does not prove anything for the machine. There is, however, something to be said for the imported machines, which are the best articles for doing the work of the fellmonger. The fellmongering industry was once a very large one in Australia, but owing to the exportation of sheepskins it has fallen off, and, consequently, fewer machines are in use. If the cost of machinery for wool scouring is continually increased there will be still less done here. It is merely a question of whether wool can be more cheaply scoured here than in England, taking into consideration the loss of weight in the carriage of wool. I shall support the Treasurer&#39;s proposal to place the article upon the free list. The arguments urged in favour of that course last night are as strong to-day as they were then. The machinery for industries such as wool-scouring should be rendered as cheap&#39; as possible in order that the industries may expand- </para>

                        <para>- There are several makers of wool-scouring machines in England, especially in Bradford, where more wool -scouring is done than in the whole of Australia. Those engaged in the industry of Australia ought to have an opportunity to test the imported machines along with the locally made machines, and to that end it is not advisable to impose a high duty. We have been told by the honorable member for Darling that a number of men are engaged in this business ; and the cheaper the machinery is made the more employment will be afforded. </para>

Probably, if he were aware of the facts of the case, he would not have given his word to the honorable member for Maranoa. Clear and positive evidence was given before the Tariff Commission to the effect that leather-making machines, and also wool-scouring machines, were made in Victoria on a commercial basis, and that a fair trade was gradually being built up ; but some of the importing firms had resorted to cutting tactics in order to kill the local industry. On page 2296 of the Minutes of Evidence there appears a letter, in which one of the New South Wales importing firms intimate their intention to reduce prices for the present, in order to compete with local manufacturers. These machines are made by Messrs. Pullan and Company, of Queen&#39;s-parade, North Fitzroy, and Messrs. Hall Brothers, of Clifton Hill, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Hope, of Abbotsford, manufacture them exclusively, showing how important the trade has become.

                        <para>- He always was a &#34;free horse&#34; - in fact, he is so free that he left the leadership of the Labour Party. There is no secret in that, because the honorable member has already admitted that his health broke down under the strain of the work. At any rate, I cannot understand the honorable member&#39;s present attitude, in view of the fact that he almost went into hysterics over the duties on piece-cotton goods. I shall never give a vote to impose unnecessary taxation on the masses. We have been told by the Treasurer that the freeing of these articles would mean a very large reduction in revenue ; but revenue was not the consideration which caused him as an out-and-out protectionist, to propose these duties. Last night the honorable member for South Sydney recommended a revenue duty on these particular tools of trade of 15 per cent. Such a duty protectionists usually regard as merely revenue producing, though suppose the honorable member for Batman would call a duty of 150 per cent. a revenue duty, if it put half-a-dozen men out of employment in Melbourne, and gave a job to half-a-dozen men in the bush of western Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt Hall&#39;s machine has done good service, but, at the same time, it has been found necessary to trot out in its favour a testimonial twenty years&#39; old.  And that is what is wrong with some of the woollen mills ; the machinery in use is twenty years old, and then it is wondered why they cannot compete with the outside world. Hall&#39;s machine was all right for the time being, but there are now improved machines on the market, particularly McNaught&#39;s machine, which is made in Bradford, England. That machine does twice as much work in twelve hours as the Hall &#39;machine does. I do not say that the English machine scours the wool any better, but it is more upto&#60;3ate. </para>

                        <para>- About that, I think. Most of the wool-scouring is done inland in Queensland, and when the machinery lias been landed at Rockhampton, Brisbane, or Townsville, enormous railway freight has to be paid for its conveyance Further, wool scouring provides employment for a great number of men after the shearing season has closed. If we impose an increased duty upon this class of machinery, there are many establishments in the western districts of Queensland -which will be compelled either to use obsolete machinery or to cease operations. Some years ago, I heard a member of the party to which I belong advocate in this Chamber the imposition of an export duty upon greasy wool. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that that was the idea .underlying the suggestion. I know for &#34;a fact that the German buyers prefer t&#39;o purchase greasy wool. During the past ten years a larger quantity of wool has been scoured -in the Commonwealth than was previously scoured here. As a matter of fact, the quantity of :wool scoured is increasing every year. I should like patent wool scouring machines to be placed on the free list. I fail to see -why the wool industry should be penalized any more than is any other industry, seeing that it has to compete in the markets of the world. </para>

                        <para>- If this machinery could not be made in the Commonwealth I could understand honorable members urging that it should be exempt from duty. But it does not come within that category. Having fought for the engineering establishments, I must, in common fairness, consider the interests of the machine tool makers. I do not know of any particular firm in New South Wales which produces these machines, but that is no reason why a uniform rate should not be imposed upon them. The honorable member for Maranoa has opposed the Government proposal upon the ground that it will levy a tax upon the masses. But when we consider that these machines cost ,&#163;500, surely it is patent that such an argument is devoid of substance. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite aware of that. At a later stage I might just as reasonably put forward a plea to exempt from duty expensive engineering machines, costing ^2,000 or ^3,000 each, in the interests of a company like that of Mort&#39;s Dock. But I shall refuse to do so. The honorable member for Parramatta has adopted the common -sense view of this matter. He supports the imposition of a uniform rate. Uniform treatment should be meted out to all these industries, and I fail to see why one branch of an industry should be protected whilst another is not. If any honorable member proposes a duty of 15 per cent, or 20 per cent, upon these machine tools, I shall be found supporting him. </para>

                        <para>- The proposal is to exempt from duty wool washing and wool scouring machinery. The honorable member desires to exempt one particular machine, but he must recollect that hard cases make bad laws. It would be unwise on our part to exempt only one particular machine. The proposal to exempt wool scouring machinery if carried would mean placing upon the free list machines which are being manufactured in Australia. As a protectionist I cannot subscribe to that principle. I want to see&#39; uniform treatment meted out to manufacturers so far as their tools of trade are concerned. I am willing to admit that a duty of 15 per cent, all round would not be much in the nature of a protective duty. But it is better than having a machine admitted free. </para>

                        <para>- When the general duty is only 15 per cent., I shall not vote for preference. The only alternative to a uniform all-round duty on machine tools is to admit all machine tools free, and the Government, to be logical, should propose one course or the other. We have decided that a duty shall be charged on machines used by tanners, to which I did not object, although there are a number of tanneries in my district. But now the Government ask us to admit free of duty wool-scourers, some of which are manufactured here. I trust that the Committee will agree to an all round duty of 15 per cent, upon all kinds qf machine tools, and to bring that about we should vote against the omission of wool-scouring machines from the dutiable list. </para>

                    <para>.- Last: night I drew attention to the fact that many objections have been made to the classification of machine tools. My  attention has been drawn to the very arbitrary classification adopted by the Department, under which tools which are regarded by the trade as all coming within the same category have been treated, some as dutiable, and some as free. Under item 167 the Department has power to issue bylaws declaring that certain machine tools should be free. I have here an enumeration of machine tools,, all of the same class, and some of them actually used in the same machines, in regard to which the Department differentiates, making some dutiable and allowing others to come in free. I indorse the sensible suggestion of the honorable member for South Sydney that there should be an all-round low duty, and I suggest that there should be a . common definition of machine tools. We should not proceed by enumeration. We might define machine tools as tools which are worked by power instead of by hand. </para>

                        <para>- I shall support the lowest rates proposed. I understand that many machine tools which are very effective and economical - some of them very delicate - are not manufactured in the Commonwealth. These tools, especially such as are driven by pneumatic power, are largely used by the smaller engineering establishments, in which it is&#39; found too expensive to use steam motive power. Some of these tools are covered by patents, so that they could not be made here, and any  duty  imposed on them will amount to&#39; a specific tax on production. I hope that the Minister will consider the  advisability  of imposing a low all-round  duty.  if these tools are not to be admitted free, and of determining upon some principle of differentiation. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to defend myself from the charge of  inconsistency made by the honorable member for Maranoa. When he spoke of an export duty on wool exported in the grease, I said, &#34; Hear, hear.&#34; I wish to say that I thoroughly indorse that suggestion. The honorable member treated my interjection, assenting to an export duty on wool, as inconsistent, and he went on to say that a great deal of the wool exported from Australia is now locally scoured. The honorable member for Parramatta interjected that the desire was to get the greasy wool manufactured in Australia. I regard that as a . very laudable desire, though, under present conditions, there is not much hope of getting a great deal of it manufactured here. But there is no reason why the bulk of it should not be scoured here, and if we put a high duty on the machinery used in the various processes of scouring, those who manufacture such machinery will establish works here, because this is the largest wool-producing -country in the world. I know, of my own knowledge, that the largest manufacturing concern in&#39; the world contemplates establishing in Sydney, in the immediate future, large manufacturing works&#39; - that is, provided that certain duties are agreed to. I am not&#34; at liberty to make the name of the firm public ; but I will give it to any honorable member who asks me for it. </para>

                        <para>- That does not affect my argument. In reply to what has been said about freights, I ask how much more would it cost to send an imported machine from Rockhampton inland than to send a locally made machine. The freights would be identical. I am sorry that the Ministry should make promises without due consideration All machines should be treated alike. If one machine which can be made locally is placed on the free list, all similar machines should be admitted free. It is intended to place other machines affecting other industries on the free list, but I shall vote against those proposals just as I shall vote against the proposal of the honorable member for Maranoa. </para>

                        <para>-I am endeavouring to get as many tools of trade as I possibly can made duty free or put on the  15  per cent. list, and because I cannot get all the items enumerated free, I am not going to object to wool-scouring machines being free. The honorable member for South Sydney has urged that all tools of trade and mechanisms for assistance to trades should be treated on a uniform basis, and subjected to a certain amount of taxation. That sounds very nice, but I think the honorable member will find that when his theory is practically applied a number of his protectionist compatriots will be as strongly against - its application as any free-trade members will be -favourable. Again,- I must congratulate the pioneers and workers out-back in having discovered a new friend in the honorable member for Batman. It has been claimed by him that under a 12 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent, duty a reduction in the price of machinery to one man in the back country has been made to the amount of ^250. What the farmer and working man out-back would like to know is what further reduction a 25 per cent, duty would bring about, and at what particular stage the magic in which the honorable member believes would give them free &#39;machines all round. .That is a line of reasoning which the honorable member must carry to its logical conclusion to see that it is not the Tariff altogether which determines the reduction in the price of machinery. There are other conditions which apply, and those conditions have operated to such an extent with . all kinds of machines - the manufacture of which cost a certain sum fifteen or twenty years ago - that there has been an all-round reduction, irrespective of the Tariff which has been imposed by this House. That will operate in the future as it has done in the past. Where new labour-saving appliances have been applied to the production of machines, and the cost of labour and material has been reduced, the result has been a reduction in the prices, quite irrespective of the Tariff. A duty affects the price of an article by increasing the cost to the consumer. Otherwise, it is of no benefit to the manufacturer. It is claimed that it is more profitable to export wool in a greasy state to the seat of manufacture, and have it scoured there, than to have it submitted to a scouring process here and then re-submitted to another process. </para>

                        <para>- That argument has been put forward. Apparently a number of honorable members ha.ve not fully realized the changes which have been brought about. Take the far-back country, such as the Maranoa electorate, where the product has to be carried for hundreds of miles by bullock or horse teams to the nearest railway station. There is a large quantity of wool which is inferior&#39; in that it is short. It is so loaded with dirt that, unless it is cleansed on the spot, it is a lost product. </para>

                        <para>- In the far back country, I have seen sheds where large quantities of .that kind of wool have been thrown- out in heaps until such time as mechanical contrivances are brought along and enable it to be properly treated. That is done with the assistance of wool-scouring machines, and men are profitably employed in the process. The honorable member for Maranoa has pleaded with the Minister to assist that form of industry by allowing the machines to be imported as cheaply as possible. I remind the Committee that the men who are engaged in this industry have to compete with Germany, France, and other producing centres, and that their wages and returns are determined by that open competition. They cannot derive any benefit from a protectionist policy. If honorable members levied a duty of 100 per cent, on wool, it would not benefit those persons by one iota. The product has to be sold in outside centres. There is another point which I think ought to&#39; appeal to the Committee very strongly. When framing the old Tariff, it was decided that wool-scouring machines should be placed on a 12 J per cent, list, but the very same Committee decided that the coddled manufacturing interests of Australia, particularly of &#34;Victoria, should have certain lines of machinery put on the free list, despite the fact that they could be made here. That principle &#39; has been indorsed by this Committee. So that at the present time the big woollen mills of Melbourne and elsewhere can freely import wool-scouring machines for use in their factories. If  a  squatter or settler requires a machine to assist him to prepare his wool clip for the market, to turn an unmarketable commodity into a marketable one, the protectionists clap a duty of 12 J- per cent, on his machine, and now it is proposed to raise the duty to 25 per cent, in the general Tariff, and 20 per cent, in the preferential Tariff. Where is the justice in that kind of Tariff reform? If the Committee has any sense of justice at all it will assist the Minister to put wool-scouring machines on the free list in the interests of not only the Victorian wool manufacturers, but also the men struggling in the way-back districts of the Commonwealth to develop its resources. </para>

                        <para>- It is well known that a man does not want to cart a wool-scouring machine about on his back. A wool-scouring plant, if erected in any town in western Queensland, would make many homes bright, and give a chance to the nomad to settle down and become a respectable citizen. In western Queensland the nomad has not the opportunity of settling down that lie has in Melbourne and Sydney. He cannot go home every night to his wife and family. In many instances he has to follow the sheds round through the seasons, and he does not see his family from one end of the year te the other ; he has to follow up his nomadic employment. The establishment .of a wool-scouring industry in a town would give him a chance to settle down there, and add to the population, sending his children to school. </para>

                        <para>- Was the duty on salt a population question? I remember seeing the honorable member standing in his place and shedding crocodile tears about the poor farmer having, during the bad times, to take his horse and dray and go out to collect salt. But I shall not pursue that line of remark. The honorable member for Batman had the cool effrontery to get up here this morning and say that he is a representative of the pastoralist and the farmer.  I wonder how many, pastoralists, farmers, and selectors are to be found in the great city of Collingwood. If there are any pastoralists, selectors, and farmers in the honorable  member&#39;s constituency, they have retired from business. The rest of the people there simply make money out of our producers. If it were not for our farmers, selectors, and pastoralists, Collingwood would be no more than a run for pigs. The reason why I feel so strongly on this point is that the most unfair proposition I ever heard of in my life was made by the Government in the first instance in regard to these machines. As the Tariff was introduced, machines for scouring wool had to pay  25  and  20  per cent. duty. But the woollen mills of Melbourne and Sydney, whose managers could get the ear of the Government, were allowed to import the self-same machines duty free. I have no objection to machines that can be made in the Commonwealth being taxed, but these particular machines cannot be made commercially in Australia. They are patented. That is why I am so eager to have them placed on the free list. The honorable member for South Sydney said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- McCaughey.</inline> had one of these machines on his station. That may be so. . But on such stations it is not very important whether the machines scour the wool in a week or in a month. They do not mind so long as they get the wool scoured in time for the next sales. But persons who undertake this work by contract want to get rid of it as quickly as possible. Those who go in for the latest machinery are worthy of applause. By imposing a high duty on these machines, we are simply barring the path of . progress. If I cannot get the machines placed on the free list, I ask honorable members to make the duty as small as they possibly can. </para>

                    <para>. - This debate has taken a turn which I hardly expected. Some time ago I had a conversation with the honorable member for Maranoa, who pointed out to me that wool-scouring machines for use in the woollen mills were admitted free, whilst machines of the same character used for scouring wool in wool-sheds were charged duty. I thought that was a serious anomaly, and told the honorable member that all these machines should be placed upon the, same basis. That is why I have moved the amendment. </para>

                <para class="block">That was not made so explicit in the Tariff of  1902,  but the rebate was allowed departmentally. There seems to be a strong desire that this machinery should not be treated differently from other machinery, but that all should be dutiable. I regret very much that the Committee has not agreed to all the duties as proposed by the Government, and that the duty on machinery is not as high as I had hoped it would be. But this question is very far-reaching, though the sum of money involved is not large. For instance, the imports of machine tools amount to &#163;125,000 a year. The duty paid is not much. &#39; There will not be much loss of revenue from the reduction proposed to be made. It is not a very important matter either from a protectionist or revenue point of view. To save a long discussion, it is just as well that an arrangement should be made. The honorable member for Maranoa has very generously relieved me from the promise which I made to him, because I should have felt bound, even if my proposal had been defeated, to fight it for him if he had insisted. As he has relieved me, and as it is the general feeling that an average duty of 15 per cent. should be placed upon these goods, I shall ask leave to withdraw my amendment. It has been proposed that the duty shall be 15 per cent. all round. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like the Minister to consider the suggestion made last night by the honorable member for South Sydney in regard to printing machinery. I recognise that there is some reason for imposing a lower duty on such machinery than on machinery of other kinds, since there is no protection given to the printing and bookbinding trade by the exclusion of books and so forth. Would it not be desirable to subject printing and bookbinding machinery to this rate of duty ? </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with some attention to the discussion of this important item in the Tariff, and fail to understand the position into which honorable members have allowed themselves to drift. Honorable members seem to be dealing with this item from the point of view, not of whether or not it is desirable to impose a duty, but of whether we can include all machine tools in. the item and subject them to the same duty, with a view to securing more revenue. </para>

                        <para>- Many machines mentioned in this item can be made in Australia. If they cannot; they should not be subjected to a duty of  15  per cent. No protectionist, worthy of the name, should attempt to raise revenue in this wholesale fashion by imposing a duty of  15  per -cent., which is a revenue, rather than a protective impost. The discussion which has taken place with regard to the machinery mentioned by the honorable member for Maranoa should convince , the Treasurer that it is unwise to indicate to any honorable, member that he sympathizes with some object that he has in view. </para>

                        <para>- That is not fair. As God is my judge, no one has spoken to me about the matter. I happen to know what I am talking about, since artesian boring is in full swing in my constituency. There is more artesian boring done in my constituency, and in the Kennedy electorate, than in the whole of the rest of Australia. If I do not make some effort to safeguard the interests of my constituents, of what use  am  I here? I want to have some interpretation of the term &#34; artesian boring machines &#34; on record, in order that my constituents may have no trouble in connexion with the importation of this machinery. I hope the Treasurer will not think that any one has been getting at me in connexion with the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I will inform the honorable member if he has patience. A <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Overall,</inline> who is a manufacturer of these tools in New South Wales, was heard by the Commission with respect to artesian boring tools, machinery, and plant, and he said that the industry was in a languishing condition owing to the want of sufficient protection and consequent excessive importations. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Overall</inline> and a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomson</inline> joined in the request that the duty should be from 15 per cent. to 20 per cent. on boring tools, including jars, bits, underrimers, fishing tools, boxes, and pins, sinkers, and sand pumps. The item has nothing to do with the motive power, but merely with boring tools. </para>

                        <para>- I am talking about the turning of the rods, and the honorable member is thinking of the working of the jars. The one is turning, and the other is  sinking.  I intend to stop here until I get the information for which I have asked. The Treasurer has not said whether the rods used would be duty free or not. Are the wire rope and the shackles used in connexion with artesian boring to be free? I have said that I do not wish to trap the Minister, but I should be told exactly what would be admitted free and what would have to pay duty. If any of the appliances used in connexion with artesian boring can be made in Australia, I am prepared to assist the Minister in imposing a duty upon them, but I wish to help my constituents by letting them know what they will have to pay duty on, and what they can import duty free. </para>

The term covers everything used in connexion with artesian boring that is not specially classified. We do not want a list as long as from here to Christmas of the various articles required in boring. Shackles were mentioned, and they are used for many purposes as well as for artesian bores. Rods and wire ropes have also been mentioned, and they are used for a thousand and one purposes. </para>

                    (Batman) &#91;2.27}.- I should like to correct a statement made by the honorable member for Maranoa with respect to wool scouring machines. I know of a case in which an imported and an Australian machine are being worked side by side, and the Australian machine is doing double the quantity of work done by the imported machine. The Minister proposes a duty of 15 per cent., and I thought the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission would have had something to say about the evidence on the matter before trie Commission.

                        <para>- That was the reason given by the . manufacturer. A manufacturer in Brisbane also gave evidence on the subject. Why should the rate be reduced to 15 per cent. ? Machinery ls lying idle in my electorate in connexion with this industry, and, the place is practically closed down. The Committee should have some information from the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission on this item. A large amount of evidence was given about it, but none of it has been quoted so far in this debate. If the duty  has the effect of reducing prices, and of giving employment, why should we reduce it? Why say to the  people who ask for 30 and 25 per cent., &#34;We will give you only 15 per cent.?&#34; Why have the Government come down from their original proposition? If the Government agree to a revenue duty, which will give no protection, the result will be to put up the prices of machines and tools used in connexion with various industries. A high protective Tariff, which encourages local competition, will reduce prices. The price of one boot-making machine when there was no local competition was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;jo.</inline> As soon as the local competition took place it was reduced to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50.</inline> . In addition, the American trust stated that they were prepared to supply their machines at 20 per cent. less. I gave an illustration earlier in the sitting of local competition reducing the price of wool-scouring machines by <inline font-style="italic">&#163;250.</inline> In New Zealand, the duty is 20 per cent, against Great Britain, and 30 per cent, against the foreigner. We should have the same rates here. I am surprised at the Government climbing down as they have done. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that there is an agreement for a general duty of 15 per cent, on this item. That appears to be quite sufficient, but I take this opportunity of pointing out the extraordinary position, occupied by some honorable members. In the case of machinery for the mining industry, which is one of the great primary interests of Australia, a number of apparent prohibitionists were not prepared to go below duties of 25 per cent, in the general Tariff and 2b per cent, as against Great Britain. Some honorable members fought for even higher duties, but when it is a question of machinery for secondary industries, they regard 15 per cent, as sufficient, especially in the case of those allegedly important and highly technical machines for tanning hides or making hats, or for use in woollen mills. I think that one industry should be put upon the same basis as another as regards the duties on its machinery. There , is nothing highly technical in the manufacture of the machines included in this item as compared with some intricate mining machinery, yet an extraordinary preference is given to one industry - over another.. That preference, moreover, is given to industries which already receive considerable assistance from the Tariff by protection on the commodities which they produce. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that they have, and I admit that that seems to settle the question, but an explanation ought to be given why 25 per cent, and 20 per cent, duties are imposed on the machinery of a great primary industry which can receive no direct benefit from the Tariff, while there is such .an extraordinary anxiety to reduce to 15 per cent, the duty on machinery for secondary industries, which certainly can, be made in this country. With the natural protection in the case&#39; of all the. articles included in this item, excepting, perhaps, some of the boring machinery, 15 per cent, is ample, but it will be necessary for some of those who voted for a 25 per cent, duty on other machinery to show special reasons why they should vote for 1.5 per cent, in this case. There seems to be a certain amount of mystery, so far as the Treasurer is concerned, surrounding artesian boring machines, but outside of the motive power, rods, bit, and cable of a boring machine, what remains ? They are not very technical, but if they are not being produced commercially in Australia they might well be placed on the free list, because it is very much more important to Australia to encourage artesian boring in arid districts than it is to have two or three men engaged in a factory near one of the big cities. Immense areas of arid land could be utilized by the discovery of artesian water, and that would mean thousands of pounds to Australia. Motive-power machines have already been dealt with under the n.e.i. division in a previous item, and  1  suppose that five men would be able to produce all the rods, cables, or bits needed in Australia. If they cannot be commercially manufactured here, they ought to be on the free list, and not subject to a duty of 15 per cent. , although in regard to the rest of the item I do not feel disposed to vote for a lower duty than 15 per cent. At the same time, there is no necessity to make the duty any higher than 15 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Kalgoorlie is continually accusing honorable members of voting in different ways on different kinds of machinery, but the . machinery under this item is not in the same category as that which the honorable member refers to. Any one who votes for a  15  per cent. duty on this item should not be considered inconsistent because he has voted for duties of 25 and  20  per cent. on previous items. </para>

                        <para>- I think so; and unless further complications are to be created, the proposal must be amended. There seems to be a desire to have a uniform duty of  15  per cent., though, personally, I think that desire is,  perhaps, a mistake. A great number of these items were free in the old Tariff, while others bore a duty of  12/2  per cent. The A division of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of  20  per cent., while the B division recommended, in certain cases,  10  per cent., and, in other cases,  15  per cent. Evidently there is a feeling that, as I say, there ought to be a uniform duty of  15  per cent. ; and in order to save time, that might as well be accepted. So far as the machines mentioned by the honorable member for Batman are concerned, those interested in the manufacture have no ground of complaint, except that the duty that will be imposed &#39;is not so high as that proposed by the Government. At the same time, the duty which the Committee seem to desire is higher than that in the old Tariff. The proposal now is to make all dutiable at  15  per cent. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not rise for the purpose of discussing the item, but in order to make a personal explanation at the earliest possible moment. When the honorable member for Fawkner was dealing with item  150,  he quoted some letters in which it was stated that the discs or plates used in connexion with disc ploughs and harrows were not made in Australia. I challenged the honorable member&#39;s statement, and said that these articles were made by a gentleman whose name I gave at the time, and who carries on business at Finley, in the State of New South Wales. I find, however, that I was misinformed.. I have been in communication with the gentleman, and he writes that, while it is true he manufactures disc ploughs and harrows, the discs or plates are imported. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is not quite fair. When there are advertisements, such as that I now hold in my hand, declaring that the patents are held by the manufacturers, and thus leading to the belief that the whole machine is made by them, the conclusion at which I arrived is a very natural one. I have no desire that the Committee should remain under any misapprehension so far as this manufacturer is concerned; and, if his statement be correct, I suggest that an opportunity should be afforded to reconsider the item, with a view to placing the discs or plates on the free list. . </para>

                    <para>.- I am glad to hear the manly explanation of the honorable member for Riverina; and I hope, that his suggestion to recommit item 150 will be accepted by the Treasurer. The articles .referred to are admittedly not made in the Commonwealth ; and to retain the. duty would simply increase the prices of ploughs and harrows which are very largely used by agriculturists. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to draw the Treasurer&#39;s attention to what I think is an error in connexion with the proposed duty on pneumatic hammers. - It was not intended, under the old&#39; Tariff nor, do I think, in this, that hand pneumatic hammers should be made dutiable. These patent hand hammers are not made in Australia, and, under the by-laws, ought to be free as machine tools for metal working, caulking, chipping, and riveting. As the item appears now, however, these hand pneumatic hammers are made dutiable under the all-embracing words &#34;pneumatic hammers,&#34; Steam hammers, where the steam operates within the tool, are allowed in free, while other steam hammers are dutiable. </para>

                        <para>- I have rend, three or four communications dealing with the matter. If I am not mistaken&#39; &#34; roll shells &#34; have been removed from an item under which they were free and placed under this. item. Now, roll shells are very largely used in connexion with mining operations. They are manufactured only by one local company, and I am informed by men from Broken Hill that the locally-manufactured roll shells are not much good. It is only under the compulsion of circumstances that they are used. According to telegrams received from Broken Hill within the past three or four days, consternation was created at that centre by the action of the Committee in removing roll shells from the free list and including them in this item under which they are dutiable at 30 percent. Inasmuch as the mining industry is heavily taxed already under the Tariff, and seeing that it gives employment to about 112,000 persons, and that our mineral exports are worth about&#163;25,000,000 a. year, whereas our manufactured exports are worth, only a little over &#163;1, 000,000 a year, I trust that the Treasurer will reconsider this matter, and not, apparently in the interests of one firm, unduly tax an article very largely used in mining. </para>

                        <para>- Does that affect the question ? I am informed that under the Tariff of 1902 roll shells were free. My informants state that the Steel Company of Australasia makes shells, and that they have tried a few, with poor results. Those made by Krupp undoubtedly have the longest life, and are of uniform quality, a virtue which the Australian article does not possess. Inasmuch as they use thirty sets per annum in a new mill, the duty will come to a very considerable sum. The following letter has been sent to me to show, how many and various are the articles which come under item 171 - </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister should give us more information as to what it is intended to bring within this drag-net item, and what it is intended to exempt. In the 1902 Tariff there is a long list of articles exempted from the duties on manufactures of metals. Nothing of the kind appears in this Tariff, and we have no information as to what the Department will, later on, declare to be included in item 171, and what will be exempted from the proposed duties. Another matter to which I wish to refer is this : The Government in the future will have to import a large quantity of copper wire for the extension of its telegraphs and telephones. I am aware that no direct Government importations are dutiable, but, inasmuch as this material will probably have to be purchased from contractors, who will import it, the free list is the proper place for many of these articles. The adoption of a duty will involve higher prices ; it will artificially inflate the revenue, and we shall be repeating the experience of Victoria, where, during a boom, the Government inflated their revenue by charging high duties upon articles imported for Government use. Our accounts will become complicated, inasmuch as three-fourths of the revenue from Customs and Excise must be returned to the States. </para>

                        <para>- It would be all right so long as the contractors had not to pay the duty. If duty is paid, the Commonwealth gets only one-fourth and the States the remaining three-fourths, so that it is not sound finance to impose duties on Commonwealth requirements. </para>

                        <para>- Not quite. The course suggested by the honorable member for North Sydney could be followed ; but it is worth while to bear in mind the undesirability of collecting duty on goods imported for the various services&#39; of the Commonwealth. The cost of all the imported articles used by the various Departments will be increased if they are made dutiable, and this will give a false impression as to the actual amount of our Customs revenue. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Another matter to which I wish to call attention is this : Parliament is voting various rates of duty for the encouragement of our different industries. Those rates must be regarded as the maximum protection which we think should be given to those industries. But the practice of the Departments has been to give local tenderers a preference of from 15 to 25 per cent. over foreign competitors, in addition to the duty. That, in my opinion, is illegitimate and improper. </para>

                    <para>.- Item 171 covers, I take it, practically all the manufactures of metal not elsewhere specifically dealt with in the Tariff. Yesterday, however, after a great deal of discussion, the Committee decided that the rates of duty which should apply to the various kinds of machinery dealt with under items 163, and 164 should be 25 and 20 per cent., and, therefore, I intend to move to reduce the rates now proposed from 30 and 25 to 25 and 20 per cent. I hope that the Government, with a view to expediting business, will accept the suggestion. </para>

                        <para>- Band saws, for breaking down logs, are nearly all imported, because the saw-making industry is more developed in other countries. In the case of circular saws I do not think it is desirable to restrict the range of choice. The lives of the workers depend upon the quality of the saws. If the users are not given the widest range of choice they are apt to take a saw which may not be so reliable as the saw which they would otherwise demand. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so, but I would give to the users the widest possible range of choice, because those who have been making these saws for generations in other countries have acquired great perfection in the art. The local manufacturers would undoubtedly get the preference if they made good circular saws; but I would not limit the range of choice. I propose to move that all band and circular saws be duty free. </para>

                        <para>- The recommendations of the A section of the Tariff Commission were that saws generally should be liable to a duty of 20 per cent., but that hand saws, saw plates, steel band or ribbons for making saws should be free. So that a duty of 20 per cent, would operate on the very class of saws which honorable members want either to exempt or to be made liable to a lower duty. It is the band and circular saws which we want to have made here. We propose to admit free the carpenter&#39;s hand saw ; but the big saws are being made in Melbourne and Sydney, and I strongly object to them being made liable to a lower duty, or to being placed on the free list. There was very strong and satisfactory evidence given in favour of a duty of 20 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not be bullied out of my course by the Treasurer. I am speaking of what I know. There is no chance of the local manufacturers making saws suitable for the various descriptions of business which are carried on in Australia. For sawing hard wood and soft wood, different kinds of teeth are required. Tasmania requires saws different from those which are used in Western Australia or Queensland. It is unfair to impose duties of 25 and 20 per cent. I am a reasonable protectionist. </para>

                        <para>- No; I am not a hat maker. Honorable members who laugh have just allowed the free admission of hat-making machines,- but they will not allow a man who is employed in the bush in building up Australia to get his saws free of duty. I do not want the saws to be admitted free, but I desire a reasonable duty to be levied. According to some invoices which I saw to-day, a saw -which was sold at &#163;4 16s. under the old Tariff is now sold at &#163;6 6s. That is monstrous. I want honorable members to realize that these high duties of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent, affect Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia particularly. In my opinion, duties of 15 per cent, and 19 per cent, will be quite enough to impose. That is what I call reasonable protection. </para>

                    <para>.- What the honorable member for Fremantle proposes is no protection. He made a statement which suggests that he is prejudiced against anything eastern. He stated in the first place that we could not make anything good, and in the second place, that he had to wait for a long time while a saw was being made. </para>

                        <para>- A man is a fool who will put his finger or neck on a saw in a mill. In my electorate there are a considerable number of saw-mills dealing with, perhaps, as hard a wood as the honorable member for Fremantle has had. any experience of, namely, the well-known red gum. I believe that the majority of the sawmillers - certainly some of them - prefer the Australian-made saw to the imported saw. </para>

Circular saws and vertical saws of all kinds are made at an establishment in Lonsdale-street, Melbourne.

                        <para>- He employs twenty-two men in one mill alone.I am in sympathy with the sawmillers. The industry in the West is a very good one, but there is also a good one here.. The millers themselves are interested in getting these articles as cheaply as they can; and they are now getting them cheaper than they used to do when they had to obtain them from the importer. I hope that the Government will stand firm. </para>

                    <para>.- I trust that the Committee will not place a greater burden than is absolutely necessary upon the great timber industry of Australia. Saws are essential for the cutting of timber. When we compare the magnitude of the sawmilling industry with the smallness of the saw-making industry, it seems a very mistaken policy to &#39;make the duty very high. In Western Australia alone we export over a million pounds worth of timber per annum. I can well understand honorable members saying that, as a duty has been placed upon other machines which are of great importance to Australia, such as artesian-boring plant, we should, for the sake of uniformity, place a duty on saws. But certainly it ought not to be higher than the duty on other tools of trade. Personally, I think that saws should be free, though I am prepared to vote for a duty of 15 per cent. I do not think that saws can be made in Australia as good as those which are imported. It is not an easy thing to make a saw. People who are new to such an industry cannot turn out as good an article as is produced in a place where they have the experience of many years. I shall support the amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney. </para>

                    <para>. - We have heard a great deal about uniformity, and there is something to be said from that point of view. But saws are tools of trade, which, I think, might fairly be put on the free list. It will be admitted that the material of the saws which ; are made locally is imported in sheath form. They are then made circular or otherwise, fitted up, and have teeth put into them. That is all that constitutes the industry. Those people who use saws in the three States where there is a large lumber trade are well able to pay the duty, if they choose to import superior articles, and from that point of view there is no reason why saws should not be put on the same footing as other tools. But still I shall support a proposal to make them free, as saws are in general use. Our saw-millers want the very best material for their purpose, and to secure the best saws they must import. We were sent here to rectify anomalies in the Tariff. Saws were formerly upon the free list. Even protectionists admitted that they should be free. We leave no anomaly by allowing them to remain on the free list. The local saw-making industry is one that can stand alone. It requires no protection. As pointed out by the honorable member for Riverina, saws have been made in Melbourne in the open market. What better evidence do honorable members require that there is no need to impose a duty ?

                    <para class="block">I think we should endeavour to have something like uniformity in this Tariff, and to prevent differentiation between different classes of people engaged in different occupations. We have just dealt with a large class of things under the heading of machinery and machine tools which are used by people engaged in various occupations. I understood that by the general assent of all parties we agreed to a compromise to make these goods pay a uniform duty of 15 per cent.I do not see why these particular goods - saws - should be free any more than any other goods. </para>

                    <para>.- May I point out to those who are anxious to have a high duty on saws, that there are only two manufacturers of saws in the Commonwealth, both of whom established their industries without any duty whatever. One is Blakeley, in Victoria, who established his business thirty years ago without a duty, and the other is Chapman, of Sydney. Saws are essentially tools of trade, which should have been included under the same heading as other tools. If honorable members look at the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission, they will find that Blakeley asked for a duty of  35  per cent. on circular saws, band saws, and other saws for five years only, whilst Chapman, of Sydney, asked for a duty of  25  per cent.  On  circular saws only. Both makers admitted that their industry had been established without any duty, and acknowledged that they were doing a splendid business. They said that they were able to compete with American makers of saws, and Chapman, of Sydney, stated that he was cutting the Americans entirely out of the market. So that they are doing very well indeed under present circumstances. They are not only able to hold their own, but are absolutely driving their foreign competitors out of the local market. One of them also admitted that he was exporting profitably to New Zealand, and that for the last twenty years, in spite of the New Zealand duty, he charged  70  per cent. higher prices in New Zealand than his principal American competitor, and still held his own. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman</inline> said that he charged &#163;18  10s.  for a  5  ft. circular band saw. invoiced in America at&#163;12  8s.,  so that the local manufacturers secure immensely higher prices for their saws than are obtained for the imported articles. . He added, however, that he allowed a discount of  10  per cent. to merchants. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blakeley</inline> admitted that he got a reasonable price, and that if the duty were increased-and this bears out the statement that prices have been increased since the imposition of the new Tariff - the consumer would have to pay more. The evidence of the only two makers in the Commonwealth shows that there is not the slightest need for any duty. I suppose that it would be too much to expect the Committee, composed as it is, to place these items on the free list, as they were under the old Tariff, but I intend to vote for the lowest duty I can obtain. </para>

When I moved that the duty in the case of foreign imports be reduced to 15 per cent.,  I  intimated that  I  thought that we should impose the same rate on imports from Great Britain, since we had adopted a similar course in regard to other tools of trade. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member forMaranoa thinks so he is welcome to retain the opinion. A glance through the. two printers&#39; catalogues I have here they would see what an absurd thing it would be to impose any duty at all on type or printers&#39; materials. If this man did succeed in shutting out the results of the genius and industry of type founders throughout the world, a good deal of the printing that is now done in Australia would have to be done elsewhere. Certain banks and manufacturers wish to have high-class printing done, and if they were to be confined to the few faces manufactured by the Sydney manufacturer; it would be impossible for them to have the work they require done in Australia. I may inform the Committee that there is very little type imported to Australia at the present time. Honorable members who may be under the impression that they are being asked to vote for a duty which will have the effect of starting a type foundry with a large output are utterly mistaken, because throughout Australia the large newspapers now use linotype or monoline machines, and have practically discontinued the use of &#39;ordinary type. That is the position of affairs with the largest users of type in Australia. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus, .</inline> the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily. Telegraph,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> and, in fact, all the metropolitan newspapers have installed linotype or monoline machines, and do not now use ordinary printers&#39; type at all. I wish the Committee to thoroughly understand that the proposed duty would operate as a special tax upon country printers and small job printers throughout Australia. It would not affect the big. newspaper proprietors, who would not have to pay one penny of this duty. It would be merely an impost levied on, men who, at the present time, have the utmost difficulty to live. To prove what I say,I have only to refer honorable members to the value of the importations of type into Australia in  1906.  The quantity imported in that year amounted in value to only &#163;9,032, and of that about  , &#163;5,000  worth - and I can get the exact figures in a moment - was re-exported to New Zealand and other countries. </para>

                        <para>-An importer knows better than that. The amount of interest which he would lose on his capital during the time would be more than anything he could possibly gain by any Tariff advantage. Of this material, &#163;5,975 worth was re-exported last year, so that, as a matter of fact, only a little more than &#163;4,000 was imported into and used in Australia during that year. </para>

                        <para>- Anything may be proved by quoting an abnormal year. If the honorable member quotes  1902,  why does he not go back and quote  1898  or 1900, or any other year selected at random? Why not also  1903, 1904,  and  1905?  The. fact remains that only about  &#163;4,000  worth of type was imported and retained in Australia during the year mentioned. The proposed duty is merely a tax upon the country printers, a class of men who have all they can do at present to make ends meet. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Coolgardie that this duty is a tax upon the country press. Type is not largely used by the large daily papers in the cities, although the job printers use it. The country press does a great deal of service in placing before the public reports of the proceedings of Parliament and other information, and the least we can do is to take into consideration the amount of benefit which we receive from it. The type is a tool of trade to country papers. I support the proposal of the honorable member for Coolgardie that the article should be free. Failing that, the duty should not be higher than 15 per cent., which is the rate already imposed upon other tools of trade. Assuming that some protection should be given to a local industry, the amount of type used does not appear to be very great. The importation has amounted to something like &#163;5,000 worth per year for the whole of the Commonwealth, although we are told that when the Commonwealth Tariff first came into operation about &#163;46,000 worth was imported. Still, if we add another &#163;10,000 worth a year to the&#34; figures I have stated, it would mean only about &#163;15,000 worth of type imported yearly that could be manufactured here. As the type is chiefly for the use of the country press, the tax would fall upon only a small section of the community, and, therefore, would be a class tax. It cannot be passed on like many other duties. The price of the newspapers cannot be increased, nor can the charges for advertisements. </para>

                    <para>.- I rise, not to express my surprise that one of the artistic sensibility and taste of the Treasurer should have consented to place an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem tax</inline> upon &#34;quotations&#34; - probably that will not affect him very much - but to say that my attention has been called <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> this item by the South Australian Printers&#39; Association, and also by the Master Printers&#39; Association of Queensland. They state that it is necessary to have a continual change of fonts, which they cannot get unless there is bigger competition, which an increase of population in Australia will induce, and that, in the circumstances, the tax will really hamper them in getting out the best work. I hope to support the honorable member forCoolgardie in successfully getting this duty struck out. </para>

                <para>Mr.HUTCHISON.- I do not think it would. Honorable members are discussing this question in the belief that if a duty of  25  per cent. is imposed - I should not mind if the duty were  20  per cent. - the printers of Australia will not be able to obtain the type they require. Honorable members, however, have only to look at page  106  of the Customs statistics to see that the total value of the printers&#39; materials imported last year was only &#163;9,032. There is a large number of printers in the Commonwealth, and, keeping in view the comparatively small value of the importations, it will be seen that the duty would not add one iota to the cost of printing - it would be merely a few pounds divided amongst the printers. If the duty were distributed over the work, it would amount to practically nothing, because the price of printing is anything but prohibitive. </para>
                <para>SirJohn  Forrest. -  That is an argument against a duty. </para>

                        <para>- It is admitted that the enterprising firm in Sydney has been supplying to the printers in Australia quantities of type that there would have been the greatest difficulty in obtaining but for the existence of the firm. When doing special work printers have very often been glad to be able to obtain odd sorts from this firm, without being under the necessity of sending to the Old Country. Surely this firm ought not to be made a convenience of for the supply of odd sorts, and yet denied encouragement which would enable it to produce all the type that is required. </para>

                        <para>-The consumer would never know the difference, because it would be so infinitesimal. Further, I understand that Messrs.

Personally, I should not complain even if the firm did increase their prices ; they have proved such an enormous convenience, and saved so much cost and trouble to printers, that they deserve to be allowed to charge a little more. </para>

                        <para>- They do not; there are large firms which have been obliged to Messrs. Wimble and Company for tiding them over difficulty. I think that in the General Tariff a duty of  20  per cent. would be fair, but nothing under that figure. However, I shall vote for a duty of  25  per cent., so that we may not fix a duty of  20  per cent. in the General Tariff, and of 15 per cent. as against Great Britain. With duties of 20 per cent. in both columns I should be quite satisfied. </para>

                    <para>. - In this item we have another evidence of the anomalies which have been created, and which are being created, in the Tariff. Big interests are favored, while small industries are penalized. This House decided some time ago to put linotypes, monolines, and other printing machinery on the free list, and now it is proposed to tax the supplies of the small printers by imposing a duty of 25 per cent. As the honorable member for Coolgardie - has pointed <inline font-style="italic">out,</inline> most of the large newspaper and printing establishments are equipped with modern machinery of the kind I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; a good part of the earnings of many country newspaper proprietors arises from jobbing work. I have here a circular letter, copies of which other members have no doubt received, from Messrs. John Haddon and Company, of the Caxton Type Foundry, Sydney; and from that I gather that a country printer has to pay a duty of 25 per cent. on his type, and&#39; a further duty of from 30 per cent. to 40 per cent. on his frames and cases, while the larger newspaper companies, who can afford linotypes, and so forth, practically escape all imposts. Is it fair that struggling country newspaper proprietors should be penalized in this way? </para>

Wimble and Company can meet the demands of the Commonwealth as cheaply I do not say more cheaply - as can their competitors abroad, I fail to see the need for the duty. Messrs. Wimble and Company apparently have a fair field and no favour; and if they do not. avail themselves of the margin of 25 per cent., then they do not run their business on the same commercial basis as do other companies. I hope that the margin will be reduced ; and I am prepared to support the amendment of the honorable member for Coolgardie. </para>

                    <para>.- I happen to know a little about this subject; and I say that in regard to quality and prices no complaint can be found with Messrs. Wimble and Company, who, unfortunately, are at present the only firm of this class in Australia. The existence of this firm, even on a small scale, with free imports from outside, has been of great advantage to jobbing printers, especially in New South Wales. If a printer ran short, he could always get a supply in a fashion not possible with importers, who are occasionally depleted in one or other of their sorts. </para>

                        <para>- For that reason their establishment is not so extensive, and their faces of type are not so numerous, as would otherwise have been the case. They are not likely to increase their prices under a duty; but if they do, we can deal with them. I do not think that the imposition of a reasonable duty upon type is likely to prove any serious charge upon the printing community. The Committee ought to be prepared to extend some consideration to this industry, which has had to contend against great disadvantages for a long time. </para>

                        <para>- It is a medium of communication . and instruction - a medium for. the conveyance of all that which is highest and best in our civilization. A tax upon any medium of that kind must necessarily be a tax upon enlightenment. It is idle to suppose that the cost of type will not be increased by the imposition of the duty proposed. Is it to be suggested that Messrs.. Wimble and Company conduct their business from philanthropic motives? This firm is already exporting its products to New Zealand, besides doing well in Australia, so far as its resources go. I hope it may long flourish. Before we penalize all the varied products of the world, we ought to be sure that these up-to-date appliances can be manufactured as well here as they can abroad. I understand that the reason why type foundries do not multiply in Australia is that two or three type foundries practically supply the whole civilized world with type of various kinds. </para>

                        <para>- I am told that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble</inline> produces only a few kinds of type. This is not owing to lack of skill or intelligence on his part, but owing to the lack of a demand in Australia. There is not a sufficient demand in the Commonwealth to render it worth his while to produce all these varied types. For that reason, we might very well allow this item to be retained in its present form. Even in the largest type foundries in the world, there is not much labour employed. The work, I am told, is chiefly done by machinery and boys. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member said that it was only a very small industry, and that it was scarcely worth protecting. If a large number of hands had been engaged in it, he would have affirmed that it did not need protection. It seems to me that that attitude is opposed to our national development. Seeing that we can manufacture type in the Commonwealth,  ve  ought to extend to the industry all the encouragement that is possible. In a Committee constituted as this is, I suppose that it is idle to expect to secure a higher duty than 20 per  Cent.  ; but I do hope that we shall obtain that rate. Some reflection has been  Cast  upon the quality&#34; of the type manufactured in Australia, and, for the purpose  of  showing how ill-founded  is  that imputation, I propose  to,  make a few quotations. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percy</inline> W.

                        <para>- If all did that, there would be no need to extend protection to the industry. The testimonials merely show that the foundry is able to supply type equal in quality to the imported article. The chief menace to Australian industries is to be found in the fact that, when our. local manufacturers approach importing firms, the latter are not in a hurry to drop their old world connexions, particularly when a new line is offered at a slight increase on the price at which they can buy abroad. That phase of the matter is always ignored by the Opposition. They forget that importers... because&#39; of the special consideration shown to them by manufacturers abroad, give preference to the imported article. A man who is starting, a newspaper is- compelled to goto the Sydney firms for his type, and, as.&#39; they .are .helping him along, he must take what they give nlm. They therefore thrust upon him foreign type,&#39; -at prices&#39; at which&#34; the local manufacturer could sell at a good profit, the imported type in most cases being sold at prices higher than those charged for the locally-made type. It is difficult for a man, unless he be independent - and a man starting business is not generally independent, while a newspaper man very seldom is - to break away from any one set of wholesale dealers, and, therefore, the local type manufacturer has not the opportunities for selling his type which he would otherwise have. The honorable member for Coolgardie has stated that the importations of type are now worth .only &#163;9,000 a year. But in 1902 &#163;46,000 worth of type and printers&#39; materials were imported, the annual importation subsequently decreasing .to ,&#163;16,000, &#163;15,000, and then to &#163;9,000. The foreign manufacturers are in a position to- sell large consignments at very reduced rates, and the importers, since they deal in a commodity which can be kept indefinitely without deterioration, find it advantageous to lay in large stocks. It pays the makers to send out large consignments, because a bulk deal is more profitable than- a small transaction, and it pays importers to carry large stocks, because, although they have a good deal of capital lying idle, they can obtain, good discounts when buying. The foreign manufacturers pay freight, packing, and insurance to Australia, and give 15 per cent, discount on their published price lists, and another 10 per cent., or 25 per cent, altogether on big weight stuff. But while burdens may be passed on, benefits of this kind are very rarely passed on, and, therefore, the users of type get little or no advantage from this arrangement. I am&#39; opposed to giving preference to Great Britain in connexion with the importation of type, because the English manufacturers are the principal consignors of type to Australia. It has been said that the proposed duty will be a special tax on the country printers. I deny that it will. How could it be a tax on country printers, seeing that the local maker is selling his type at the same price, and, in some cases, at a lower price, than is charged for imported type? Messrs. Wimble and Company are prepared to come under any legislation for the regulation of their industry, and have already notified the printing trade that they do not intend to increase their prices. Their specimen-book contains the same list of prices as was published before the imposition of the Tariff, and I have it from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble</inline> himself- that he is prepared to guarantee not to increase his prices if the duty is agreed to. Those who wish to see industries flourish in Australia should vote for the duty. The firm to which  I  allude is, because of the special circumstances which  I  have mentioned, prevented from doing as well as it might do in the local market. Those connected with&#39; it, however, undertake not to abuse any protection which may be gwen to them. Being interested in the trade myself,  I  know that it is possible to make locally nearly all kinds of type faces. All the new designs of type faces come from America ; but the English makers pirate them. </para>

                    the standard work on American printing type. The same type of ten goes under two different names. For instance, what is called the &#34;Westminster Old &#34; by the English type-makers is called &#34; Delia Robia &#34; by the Americans. Then what is called &#34;Italian Old-style&#34; by English makers is called &#34;Jensen Old-style &#34; by the&#39; Americans. The fact that different faces of type are sold under the same name shows that there are no .patent rights in regard to them. &#39;Moreover, it is very hard to define any special face, so that local manufacturers are practically at liberty to make any face of type that they like. It has been said that only a few boys and girls are employed in making type locally ; but, as a matter of fact, some seventy hands are employed in the Sydney type foundry. Twelve handlings are necessary to produce the finished article; but, without wearying the Committee with a description of all the processes of manufacture, I wish to emphasize what I have already stated, that, while at the present time the kinds of type available for jobbing fonts are somewhat limited, there is nothing to prevent all the varieties of type that the world knows of being made, supposing that the industry gets the protection for which it now asks. I know
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble</inline>
                    personally, and have had business dealings with him. The country would be quite safe in accepting his pledge not to increase prices; but, in any case, Parliament can. protect the consumers under a measure for regulating this and other industries. The firm pays the best wages, and there is a good feeling towards it on the part of the employes, which is very pleasant to see. Even at the present time, notwithstanding the use of linotypes, the expenditure on type amounts to between &#163;14,000 -and &#163;20,000 a year. The honorable member for Coolgardie said that some of the type which is imported is again exported. That is not so. The type exported is, as the honorable member for Parramatta has stated, - the Wimble type, which is sent to New Zealand, where it finds a better market than in Australia, because the operations of the business concerns there are not so hidebound &#39; as those of the Australian firms. If we cannot get patriotism spontaneously, we must, since it is so necessary for the development of Australian industries, compel people to be patriotic by making it impossible, or at least unprofitable, for them to buy other than Australian manufactures, when these can be produced at prices not exceeding those of importations, and are of as good quality.
                </para>
                <para class="block">In view of the large expenditure upon type in Australia, probably with an increase in the duty, another firm will start, and that will provide competition. The honorable member for Calare objects to the duty on type because type is used by the small man, and he would exempt linotypes because they are used by the large man. The existence of patent rights prevents the Australian manufacture of linotypes; but there is nothing to prevent the manufacture, within the Commonwealth, of ordinary and jobbing type of all kinds, and it is only reasonable to provide for its manufacture here. The present makers are ready to be bound by any reasonable restrictions that Parliament may choose to place upon them. Once we have a factory hedged about by the necessary conditions, we have, as it were, a .policeman to watch the operations of any similar factory, and prevent evasions of the law. I hope that the Committee will take advantage of this opportunity to encourage an industry which will be a boon and not a bane to our printers. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not profess to know much about the printing business ; but I have received a circular from an influential body of printers who I think would not be guilty of printing an absolute untruth. I quite recognise the principle enunciated by the last speaker. We are here, I think, to do what we can to give a good protectionist policy to the country. But whether that is to be prohibition or not I do not know. It appears to me that we are departing very steadily from what I call a good protective policy. While at first I was quite prepared to follow the protectionist recommendations of the Tariff Commission, I am considerably shocked at the manner and the mode in which they were arrived at. Hitherto type has been allowed to come in free, and the duty recommended by the Tariff &#39; Commission, and proposed by the Government, is 25 per cent. The circular which I hold in my hand puts the position in this way - </para>

To show how considerate they have been, let me mention that there is attached to the circular a printed list, and that in  95  cases out of  100  they have agreed very largely to many of the items submitted in this Tariff. &#39; That shows, at any rate, that they were not biased.

                        <para>- That may be. It would be a considerable reduction of the present duty, but I understand that my colleagues in the corner are anxious to secure a duty of  20  per cent. in the general Tariff, and  15  per cent. in the preferential Tariff. If it is true that it will take a considerable period to build up a manufactory sufficient to cope with the requirements of the printing trade, surely it is only fair to give the printers the benefit of the doubt? If the Treasurer will agree to duties of  20  per cent. and  15  per cent. respectively, he will show his appreciation of the difficulties which have to be faced by the master printers. While some of my honorable friends ejaculate that a duty of  20  per cent. is too high, I think it is a great jump to impose that duty on an article which hitherto has been free. I was only a neophyte when the great Graham Berry introduced his protectionist policy. As I said the other night, I do not believe that he can be resting in his grave when we are putting duties of  30  and  40  per cent. on articles which he declared would never require to bear more than a duty of  12&#189;  or  10  per cent. Although, as I said before, it is a big jump to impose a duty of  20  per cent. on an article which hitherto has been free, still I am prepared to fall in with the suggestion. If the bulk of the material is imported from Great Britain, it will not do any great harm if we reduce the preferential duty to  15  per cent. </para>

                    <para>.- In regard to this item, I think that the Committee is called upon to adhere to the policy which so far has been pursued. A case has been made out on behalf of a local firm of manufacturers, who, under adverse Tariff conditions, entered upon an important business. Their products are very essential to the printing trade. It is admitted that only one fault , can be found with the firm, and that is that they have not yet attained to the position of having on hand always a stock equal to that which is essential to a country with a population of  80,000,000.  No fault has been found with the faces of the type. Every one has approved of their quality. Every criticism has been favorable. Therefore, the firm have proved their ability to produce the quality. Any one who glances at the book referred to by the honorable member for Macquarie, or the <inline font-style="italic">Inland Printer,</inline> or indeed at any catalogue, will realize what an immense number of faces the firm necessarily have to produce to keep a supply equal to modern requirements. The&#39; firm, I understand, are employing seventy hands, and importing five experts - several are now on their way - to design new faces. My information is that it is quite a common thing for type founders to attach new names to the same faces of type. The local firm have already taken steps to invent Australian designs. In my opinion, they are entitled to consideration at our hands. J have been surprised that not one of the Victorian protectionists has risen to say a word on behalf of this industry. Whenever a duty is proposed on behalf of a Melbourne industry, even if it employs only three men and a boy, there is quite a rush on their part to support the proposal, whether the local manufacturer is able to make the articles or not. I expect those honorable members to rise and support the protection which is proposed on behalf of this type-founding industry. Apart from members&#39; individual views, Parliament has adopted a protectionist policy. We have already imposed duties on items which, owing to the existence of patent rights, cannot be made in Australia. I have been trying to get some consideration for the users of those articles. I intend to support the claim of a firm which, in my opinion, is well founded, so that they may be put on an equality with other manufacturing firms, and I expect to secure the active support of valiant Victorian protectionists; whether the industry is conducted in their own State or not. </para>

                        <para>- It is admitted that practical printers require for the trade a larger number of faces than the local firm produce; but the quality of the Australian type is approved. I am informed that the best type passes through thirteen hands before it is finished. There is more labour employed in producing the best quality of type than is generally supposed. The idea of the honorable member for Parramatta seems to me to be quite out of the question. What he suggests is that the local firm shall go on without a duty until they are able to supply the whole market. If the firm should ever attain to that position, they will not require a duty. That is not the idea of protectionists at all. Why should that firm be singled out for differential treatment simply because it is not able to supply local requirements? The only other question to consider is, how much duty shall be imposed? Some practical printers have indicated that there is a sufficient margin to enable them to supply, without increasing the price, the demand which the local firm cannot supply. How far that statement is correct, those engaged in the business know best. I believe that there is a considerable margin. The local firm have, I understand, agreed not to raise the price, and the importers will act as a check upon them. There is an advantage in having type made locally. If it is up-to-date, if it is equal in artistic appearance to the best type in the world, printers are always able to secure a supply whenever they run short. I happen to know that in some cases printers have been unable to procure from the importer an additional supply of a particular font of type, and it has had to be ordered from England or America. </para>

                        <para>- I do not suggest that it happens very often, but it&#39; is an advantage to a printer when he runs short of a particular font to be able to readily get an additional supply from a local maker. This firm undertake to make a special feature of that. I am inclined to think that a duty of 20 per cent., as suggested by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, will be sufficient. Wimble and Company have been able to build up a trade without any duty at all. I think that the Committee might very well agree to an all-round duty of 20 per cent. Necessarily printers will have to import type to some extent. The local makers cannot completely overtake the Australian demand. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately the small printers are not very frequent purchasers of type. They struggle along for a long while with their old type. Any one who looks at some country newspapers will see that the type from which they are printed has not a very good face. Of course, the printers want to get their type as cheaply as they can, but the duty would not increase the price materially. There is a sufficient margin of profit to enable the importer to cut his price down. In any case, country printers are not constantly buying type. I wish to be quite fair all round. If we are going to have a protective policy, why single out type for an exception? I have tried to get consideration for other industries, and have failed. The printer can pass on the cost to his customers, but that cannot be done in the case of mining. </para>

                        <para>- That is too high; and I shall state my reasons for thinking so. I refer honorable members to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission. The proprietor of the Sydney industry gave evidence which is reported on page  2659.  He said that owing to lower prices of imported type, he can only supply &#34;sorts,&#34; which the agents of foreign makers do not supply, his prices being from 7&#189; per cent. to  10  per cent. higher. Those statements are contained in questions  78014  and  78022.  The agent of one of the importing firms, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burke,</inline> gave evidence in rebuttal of the local manufacturer&#39;s statements. He said, on page  2663,  that the local maker largely sells his type in New Zealand, against all foreign makers, at the same price as in Sydney, he paying the freight and expenses - questions  94125, 94148,  and  94158.  Again, he stated that two or three type founders supply, and suffice to supply, all the requirements of the English-speaking world, and that therefore the local industry would be small even if it supplied all the type required in the Commonwealth. He went on to say that it would not pay to design and make a new variety of type even if every printer in Australia agreed to take a quantity of each - question  94126.  The honorable member for Macquarie has mentioned that English manufacturers of type pirate American designs. . </para>

                        <para>- I am not in a position to say. whether or not that is so. I am willing to take the honorable member&#39;s word. But I point out that the same kind of thing takes place in the case of the local manufacturer. I do not make that statement on my own authority, because I do not know. I base if upon the evidence given before the Tariff Commission. With reference to pirating, it was stated there that the local maker &#34;pirates&#34; the new types designed elsewhere by making electrotype castings of each letter - questions  94132  and  94162.  The evidence goes on to show that one of the automatic type-making machines produces &#163;100 worth of type in a day, and that consequently little labour is employed, and the labour cost is insignificant - question  94174.  It is further stated that the wages are. higher in American and British type foundries than in the Australian ones - question  94136-7.  It will be seen that this is not a question of low-priced as against high-priced labour, because, as a matter of fact, the only competitors in this line of industry are paid higher wages in Great Britain and America than the local workmen are paid. It was also stated in the evidence that youths are doing work in the Australian industry which elsewhere is done by adults at high wages, those wages being  $18  per week in America, and  38s.  in England - questions  94126  and  94138. </para>

                        <para>- About sixty or seventy, I believe; but I do not think that that matters a great deal, because the great point at issue is that of wages. The argument of those honorable members, who pin their faith in heavy taxation as a means of promoting prosperity and who believe that we need to protect Australian labour against the lower wages paid in other countries, is, &#34; How are you to prevent the local manufacturer from fairly competing unless you give him the advantage of a duty?&#34; I have pointed out that&#39; the American and British workmen have greater reason to complain in this instance of the lower wages paid in the Australian industry, and that therefore there is not a tittle of excuse for removing this item from the free list. In the absence of any stronger argument than I have yet heard, I shall vote for retaining type on the free list. </para>

Wimble and Company in which they state, writing on the  6th  September, that they have about sixty men employed in their factory. Writing on the  15th  November, they state that they have seventy-one employes. I also have circulars from the Master Printers&#39; Association, and allied trades of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. All of those associations ask that these goods should be placed on the free list. The secretary of the Queensland Association states that  14,000  hands employed by these associations are interested in having the goods placed on the free list. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may know what is in the employes&#39; minds, but against that contention are two facts. First of all, we have to remember that the big printing firms get a large proportion of their appliances free. But the small country pressmen are asked to pay  25  per cent. In the second place, there are only seventy-one employe&#39;s engaged in the factory that is asking for this duty, while there are 14,000 employes who are interested in the goods being placed on the free list. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Calare has made a point which I think is a good one, and deserving of attention. The machines, which are really the maker&#39;s of type for the large newspapers, are admitted free. In other words, the large newspapers which have linotypes practically use no other type at all. This duty will, unquestionably, for many years hit the proprietors of small country newspapers. It is all very well for the honorable member for Darling to say that it will not be felt by newspaper men; if he had to buy a few faces of type for a newspaper, or sufficient founts for a job printing office, he would quickly discover that it is a very considerable Item. Country newspaper and job printing offices&#39; have to stock a large quantity of type, having regard to the work that they turn out; they have to keep in stock type which sometimes is not used more than once or twice in a year. Variety is necessary to secure custom. I have no desire to say one word against the Australian type foundry, but I would point out that it does not produce the variety of founts to be found in the catalogues of the large American and English type founders. The cost of type, even when it was on the free list, was quite dear enough for the man who had to buy it, and this duty will fall heavily upon men who can ill afford to bear it. I recognise that there is no hope of restoring the item to the free list, but I would urge honorable members not to agree to a duty of more than 20 per cent. on foreign imports, or of more than 15 per cent. on imports from Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>. - In reply to the statements made with reference to the Australian type foundry, I desire to say that it employs five skilled men, who receive from  &#163;6 to &#163;3  15s. per week, and that three more skilled artisans are being brought out by the <inline font-style="italic">Dorset</inline> in order that the foundry may cope with the increased trade which has resulted from the imposition of the duty. Since the introduction of the new Tariff, the trade has not been called upon to pay an extortionate price for type ; the country printer has not been, and is not going to be, asked to pay any portion of this duty. If he were, I should be one of the first to agitate for its repeal. I know the men engaged in this industry, and therefore have no hesitation in making this statement. In view of the fact that there are seventy-two hands engaged in the industry, and that following the arrival of the three special artisans to whom I have referred something like 250 persons will be employed, I think we should be prepared to assist it. </para>

                        <para>- Scarcely any boys; but a number of girls are employed. The type is cast in slugs, which are easily separated, and the girls have simply to part the &#34; stamps &#34; and pass them on for trimming purposes. The process is a very simple one, and since many girls have to work for their living, it is better that they should be employed in this than in many other ways. I have it on undoubted authority that the Australian type foundry is casting over 100 varieties of jobbing type, comprising some 300 characters; and fifty series of type, comprising 500 different sizes or bodies, are now cast by it. In short, I may say that the variety is sufficiently wide to meet the necessities of every country printing office. I have been identified with country newspaper offices for many years, and have no hesitation in saying that they need never go beyond Wimble&#39;s factory for what they want. Special type may be required by large job printing offices, and even those varieties will be obtainable from the local foundry when the industry is sufficiently established. </para>

                    <para>.- I have listened with attention to the debate, and have learnt that there is only one large firm in Australia engaged in the casting of type. That firm is well known throughout Australia, and, under freetrade, its business has attained considerable proportions. We have only to look at the catalogue which the members of that firm sent to us the other day, to satisfy ourselves that the industry is in a flourishing condition. No one desires that they should not have some assistance, although they seem to have done very well without it. Last year, I understand, our imports of type were valued at less than , &#163;10,000, showing a. falling off as compared with the imports of previous years. I am not going to suggest that the reason for this reduction is solely that the local industry is successfully competing with the importers, but it would not be unfair to use such an argument. It would certainly be unjustifiable to grant an industry which, has flourished without protection, the benefit of a protective duty of  25  per cent. </para>

If we agree to a duty of  15  per cent. against imports from Great Britain, and  20  per cent. on imports from the rest of the world, they should be satisfied. I have not heard one argument in support of the Government proposal, and I think that duties of  20  per cent. and  15  per cent. would constitute a very effective protection. </para>

                    <para>.- This is an item on which I am very much tempted to vote protection for the time being, if only to encourage some of the great protectionist newspapers in Australia to support an Australian industry. The witness who appeared before the Commission to ask for a duty on type, pointed out that that great protectionist organ, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> would not use his. type, and I take it that protectionists in this House are under an obligation to compel such a representative protectionist newspaper to observe the true principle of protection. I merely mention this for their information and education. </para>

For the sake of encouraging a local industry, they ought to be prepared to support such a duty as that now under consideration ; but in this, as in other cases, we find them saying, &#34; Protection is a bad thing for the other man, but very good for us.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I compliment the honorable member on the thoroughness of his efforts to carry into effect the policy of protection, and I can only regret that there are among protectionists so many striking instances to the contrary. My own view is that this duty will undoubtedly fall on those who can ill-afford to bear it - the proprietors of struggling country newspapers, who - although I may say in passing I am not a representative of a country constituency - I think are entitled to the consideration of the Committee. </para>

                    <para>.- As the honorable member for Swan has said, Wimble and Company are a very old firm. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble</inline> bought out a man named Thitchener in Melbourne, but, being unable to carry on the business, he went to Sydney, and after a hard struggle, endeavoured in vain to induce the Master Printers&#39; Association to buy him out. If he has succeeded to a certain extent in establishing this industry, it has been by dint of great exertion, by reason of his splendid mental capacity and as the result of the assistance of others in monetary and other directions. I have read all the circulars that have been sent to me in regard to. this matter, and I think the fairest suggestion that I have had put before me by a master printer is that we should impose this duty in respect of all the classes of type which Mr. Wimble manufactures and allow other classes to come in at a reduced rate. All the printers to whom I have spoken have referred in complimentary terms to the type made by the Australian foundry, and I am sure that no master printer will indorse what were perhaps the unkind remarks uttered by the honorable member for Coolgardie. </para>

                        <para>- Those gentlemen, being in favour of high protective duties, recommended the duty which the honorable member for South Sydney has mentioned. But it must be borne in mind that all the members of the Tariff Commission were equally conscientious in their examination of the evidence. There was an understanding amongst the protectionist members of the Commission when they set out on their inquiries that Australian industries were to receive higher protection, and be- cause of that they recommended the imposition of a higher duty on nearly everything that was brought under their notice. The free-traders on the Commission, knowing that this industry had been carried on in New South Wales without any protection, and was in a flourishing condition, determined that the duty ought not to be more than 10 per cent. The honorable member for Perth has stated that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, which is a protectionist organ, will not use the type manufactured by this firm. </para>

                        <para>- In contradistinction, I may point out that such free-trade organs as the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Town and Country Journal</inline> do use the type manufactured by this firm. They say that it is excellent type; quite as good as any they could get elsewhere for their particular purpose. This goes to show that free-traders are not against the establishment of local industries. The reason why the proprietors of the newspapers referred to do not use more of the Australian type is because of the excessive charge made for it as compared with the price of the imported. An honorable member of the Committee, who represents the &#34; Fourth Estate,&#34; said that if this firm obtained the protection of the proposed increased duty, they would not pass the duty on to the consumer. </para>

                        <para>- It is about time something was said on behalf of industries that can live without protection, and on behalf of the small class in the community that would be called upon to pay the whole of this tax. It would certainly fall on the poor printer in the country who would be unable to pass it on. He could not increase the cost of his publication, or his charges for advertisements, because of the keen competition of the city press. In justice, therefore, to a section of the community who have done so much for the whole Commonwealth in circulating their publications, very often at a loss, we should place this item in the position which it occupied in the old Tariff, and that is upon the free list. We know that the industry now existing would not, in consequence, be crushed, because it grew and prospered under free-trade. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that even after investigation of the position of a mismanaged concern, capital can be found for investment in this industry on a free-trade basis. Why then should we penalize the small country printer by imposing an excessive duty upon printers&#39; type? If honorable members will not agree to admit type free of duty, they should not impose a higher duty than 10 per cent., which was recommended by the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission and if they must impose a higher duty than that, then I ask them to treat the small section of the community interested in this item, as they have already decided to treat the large section to whom they have given in respect of their tools of trade a duty of 15 per cent. </para>

The honorable member for Robertson spoke under a misapprehension in saying that the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 10 per cent. on type. I have explained time and again how the Government have seized on our system of classification and applied it, as they have done in this case, incorrectly. Our finding on this subject is stated at page 28 of our report, as follows - </para>

I  am personally in favour of duties of  20  and  15  per cent. on this item, but the Minister in charge of the Tariff said that he was under the impression that an arrangement was made that  20  per cent. should be agreed to, and  I  voted as  I  did, in order to carry out the arrangement which the honorable gentleman thought was made. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister is proposing to increase the duties. He proposes to add words similar to those in the item, but with the articles enumerated in more detail, and to increase the duties up to 25 per cent. and 20 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment includes all the articles in item 176, and a few others of a similar nature. The Minister, as an intelligent man, should give some explanation to an intelligent Committee for increasing the rates. He may be able to make out a strong case, but he has made out no case at all yet. </para>

                    <para>. - What I propose is a redistribution of the articles. Screws n.e.i&#39;. come under the 5 per cent. rate and free, and are not raised to the 25 per cent. rate, as the honorable member for Robertson suggests. The articles were not clearly defined in the item as it stood in the Tariff. There is no intention in my proposal to interfere with the principle of what we have done before. The re-distribution and rearrangement has been made departmentally. Screws with nuts, engineers&#39; set screws, music-stool and table, roofing and spiral screws, should not have appeared generally in the item as they did originally. I propose to make those, and also brake and plough screws, subject to duties of 25 per cent. and 20 per cent. respectively. </para>

                        <para>- Hang the arrangement ! I have no quarrel with that. I am speaking of the increase of the rates of duty from 5 per cent. to 25 per cent. The Treasurer can re-arrange as much as he likes, so long as he does not increase the rates in this way. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite aware of that. I shall be glad to hear an explanation from the Minister, but I shall certainly resist the attempt to increase duties in this way without a word of explanation or warning to the Committee. The Treasurer should, before reclassifying articles in this way in paragraphs, and subjecting some of them to fixed and others to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties, intimate his intention to the Committee, and not spring it upon us in this way. Why are &#34; screws for wood &#34; to be subjected to fixed duties of 5s. 6d. and5s. per cwt., instead of 5 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> and free, as the Treasurer proposed when he submitted the Tariff ? </para>

                        <para>- Why, if the honorable gentleman knew of all these calamitous occurrences, did he put these articles on the free list when framing his Tariff? Have they only lately come to his cognizance? He says the want of duty has closed up an industry. Apparently, he has only just discovered it, because a few weeks ago, he put the articles on the free list. Now, perforce, they must fee subjected to fixed duties of 5s. 6d. and 5s. per cwt. How do those rates work out <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem?</inline> I have no idea as to what the incidence of this new taxation is. I do not know the value of the screws for wood, and, unless the fixed rate can be taken out for us <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> how are we to know what duty we are voting? The &#34; 5s. 6d. per cwt.&#34; is so much Dutch to us. If, as the honorable member for Boothby says, music-stool screws are related to mining machinery. I should like to know why they have not been placed in the same category as to the rates of&#39; duty? Mining machinery bears a duty of 20 per cent.; and yet the Treasurer proposes to make screws bear an impost of 25 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Then leave the classification as it is, and reduce the rates of duty ; we do not quarrel with the classification, but with the duties. Somehow or other the classifications of the Treasurer always mean an increase in duties. And I submit that this is a most surreptitious way of endeavouring to get higher duties passed. It is most unfair that we should not be given notice of the Treasurer&#39;s intentions; and I do not see why these amendments should not have been circulated this morning, so that honorable members might have an opportunity to compare the amendments with the items in the Tariff.

                    <para>.- I think that the re-arrangement proposed by the Treasurer is an improvement. The duty on some of those screws certainly ought not to be5 per cent. and free. For instance, I have in my hand a brake screw, and this and nearly all the screws mentioned by the Treasurer are square-threaded screws made on lathes. &#39; There is no reason in the world why these screws should be admitted free, because most of them are parts of the machines and engines which are to be admitted on duties of 25 per cent. and 20 per cent. There is no difference between a music-stool screw, a table screw, or a brake screw and the other screws mentioned, so far as the mechanism is concerned ; and all of them ought to be made here, as most of them are. Their manufacture gives considerable employment ; and I do not think that, in any case, many of the larger screws would be brought in finished. It is certainly ridiculous to put them in the same category as, for instance, carpenters&#39; screws, which are not made here. Engineers&#39; set screws are not square threaded, and really take the form of a bolt without a nut. These are made here ; but if they were free of duty, they would probably be imported ready-made. Almost all machines contain engineers&#39; set screws, which are generally made from steel. In my opinion, duties of 25 per cent. and 20 per cent., as in the case of machinery, would be fair. No one will pretend to say that such screws cannot be made here, or are not made here; and it is best, in order to make the Tariff harmonious, that the parts should bear the same duty as the finished article. </para>

                        <para>- That was what I understood the honorable member to indicate ; and, if it be the case, the industry is, as I say, already established on the basis of the old Tariff. The Comptroller-General has had thirty or fortyyears&#39; experience of such matters, and his suggestion was that the duty should be 5 per cent. and free. It would appear as though the honorable member for Boothby has had a word with the Minister, and that, as a result, we have the proposal to increase the duty. The only difference between the last list and the present one is, that screws for wood have been made subject to a duty equal to about 5 per cent. As I said, the original schedule was not prepared by the Minister, but by the Comptroller of Customs, </para>

                        <para>- Then notice ought to be given so that we may ascertain their possible effect, not only on the industry immediately concerned, but on other industries. No such opportunity is presented; and I shall support the amendment of the honorable member for Parramatta. The Treasurer has stated that the duty on screws for wood means about 5 per cent. If so, why separate these screws from screws n.e.i. Those screws for wood would have to cost about &#163;100 a ton, according to the percentage which the Treasurer states. </para>

                    <para>. - Because on the smaller screws the specific duty is less than the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate. At first, it seemed to me that there must be some anomaly in the rates fixed under this item. But I find that the difference between the duties levied upon nails, and screws is explained by the fact that under the previous arrangement 20 per cent. would have been levied upon nails, whereas in reference to screws we proposed 5 per cent., and free. </para>

I would suggest the omission of the word &#34; boring &#39; &#39; with a view to the insertion of a new paragraph which will include mining machines which are not made in the Commonwealth, and which are not likely to be manufactured here for many years. I think that a new paragraph might be added to read -  &#34; (d)  Rotary and Percussive Rock Drills, </para>

                        <para>- I think that the grouping proposed by the Government should &#39;be allowed to stand on the rates being reduced from 30 per cent. to 25 per cent. on the general Tariff, and from 25 per cent. to20per cent. on the Tariff against importations from the United Kingdom. Before any change, such as is proposed is agreed to, reasons should be submitted to the Chamber in support of it. </para>

                        <para>- I know nothing about coal-cutting machinery, and I am not going to offer opposition to any proposed. modification of the Tariff in regard to such machinery; but I do not think that rock drills and coal-cutting machines should be put together. There are many types of rock drills at present used in Australia which not only are of local manufacture, but owe their usefulness largely to their improvement and development by Australians. A Victorian engineer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. TaylorHorsfield,</inline> and a South Australian mining manager, Captain Hancock, of Moonta, have designed rock drills which are a considerable improvement upon those originally imported. These drills have acquired popularity in all the States, where they are largely used in assisting mining operations. </para>

I have made them by the gross for use in Broken Hill, and it is only the hostility exhibited towards Australian-made articles that is in the way. If we had the market to ourselves we should introduce new machines and new gauges, so that every part we manufactured would be interchangeable. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know how many are used in a year, but 3,000 Taylor-Horsfield rock drills have been made in Victoria, and since the Tariff came into operation no fewer than thirty or forty of these drills have been placed in the mines at Broken Hill, which shows that they are useful for the purposes for which drills are required.

                    <para>I have been using the Taylor-Horsfield improved national rock drills for the past two and a half years on the Menzies Consolidated G. M., and have pleasure in recommending them for durability and efficiency, also economy in air consumption. I have been working rock drills of all makes in the various States for the last twenty years, and have no hesitation in stating that the Taylor-Horsfield drills have proved superior to all others I have used. </para>

                    <para>For rather more than two years we have been using the No. 2 Taylor-Horsfield Improved National Rock Drills in shaft sinking, driving, and mining generally on this property. . . For boring solid quartz, I find the machine particularly effective.

                    <para>The new Ingersoll machine was the first to operate, and in 8 minutes 43 seconds put in a hole 47 in. in depth. This was taken as a period for the test, and each machine was given a similar time to operate to see what it could do. The Taylor-Horsfield New Type National Drill then started, and put in excellent work from the first strike, and soon got to the extent of its longest drill. It was then found that this drill had put down a hole to the depth of 53 in., and that it had been at work for only 7 minutes 8&#189; seconds, or1 minute 34&#189; seconds less than the time allowed for the test. The Ingersoll-Sargent Drill was then set to work, and having operated for the full time - 8 minutes 43 seconds - the hole was found to measure 48 inches. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that this testimony will convince honorable members that rock-drills are made in Australia, and on an extensive scale, too, and also that they have acquired a good reputation. Of late years, I believe that the American Drill and Pump Trust - known as Ingersoll Sargent Rand - have been exploiting the Australian market and trying to run out Australian drills: I am informed that they have been entering into agreements and compacts with some mining companies to sell their drills at a cheaper rate, in consideration of the understanding that the latter shall use only imported drills. </para>

                        <para>- I have also heard that tremendous, efforts have been made by  this large company to defeat this duty, and to get rock-drills practically placed on the free list. I hope that honorable members will extend fair consideration to the Australian drills, as well as to other Australian productions, and will not give any weight to the misrepresentations which are being made in various quarters about their inefficiency. It has stood the test and led the way in the development of mechanical ingenuity. I may say that in South Australia, the Tariff Commission were informed by an engineer that this Trust were on the look out for the slightest improvements in Australian drills, and that whereever they saw that an improvement had been made, they practically pirated it and utilized it for their own purposes. </para>

In June, 1904, the company called for tenders for the supply of rock drills by local makers and agents for imported machines. I have a list of the quotations, but I will not give the names. One American rock drill was quoted at &#163;45 ; the Bendigo rock drills at &#163;41 and &#163;42 each; the Castlemaine rock drill at &#163;37 15s. ; and the Austral-Otis rock drill at &#163;43. An order was placed with Parke and Lacey, of Sydney, for Ingersoll Sargent rock drills at &#163;44 10s. each, which was largely in excess of the price quoted for the local article. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that they wished to give a preference to the imported article. Since then, I believe, the price of the Australian rock drill has been reduced. I am assured that through the fierce competition which has been going on some of the imported rock drills can be obtained at &#163;32 or &#163;34 or &#163;3 5, and some of the local rock drills at from as low as &#163;27 to &#163;28. So that, as regards price, they are getting down to bedrock. I do not believe that they could be made here more cheaply without being sold at a loss. The Ingersoll-Sargent-Rand Trust are making things so hot for the local manufacturers that it is feared that the latter will have to carry on their business at a loss, which, of course, could not be sustained for any length of time. </para>

                        <para>- Evidently the trust are making things very warm and bringing down the price, and the manufacturers of the local rock drills, in order to get any trade, have to quote a price lower than that of the imported article. Otherwise they would go behind. </para>

                        <para>- In the opinion of some persons it is. I have been told, and according to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission it is clear, that the Australian drill is as good as the imported article. As regards the rock to be penetrated, the Long Tunnel mine, at Walhalla, in Gippsland, has, I believe, country as tough, hard, and metallic as any rock formation in Australia, and yet the Taylor-Horsfield rock drill was used with great success in the sinking of an inclined shaft at that mine. In the <inline font-style="italic">Mining Journal,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Finlayson gives an account in which it is stated that the boring in the hard slate and the sandstone silurian of the Long Tunnel mine was done by machines made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor-Horsfield,</inline> of Bendigo. I do not think that the rock formation of Kalgoorlie is harder than the rock formation of that mine, or the New Chum Railway mine at Bendigo,  4,400  feet deep, being the deepest quartz mine in the world. I contend that Australian rock drills are equal to the requirements of mining not only in Victoria, but in all the other States. Up to the present time I have not heard any fair, reasonable grounds why the imported rock drill should be differentiated and placed on the free list. </para>

Under the old Tariff this was one of the items which were placed on the free list, and so far as I know no suggestion was made then that a duty should be imposed. Up to the present time there has been no duty on this article in the Australian Tariff. An extraordinary position has to be faced, however, in regard to this matter. The factory where rock drills are made happens to be in the constituency of the last  speaker,  who was also  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission; but although the head of the firm had an opportunity of bringing his case before the Commission, he did not do so. The only firm in Australia that puts rock drills on the market in any large quantities at the present time is the Taylor-Horsfield firm. </para>

                        <para>- After all, it really does not matter very much whether he attended; he did not ask for a duty. The honorable member has read a number of testimonials from Western Australia - some from Kalgoorlie - but the latest which he could produce was written in  1903  - four years ago. My honorable friend will admit that in regard to rock drills, as in regard to all other classes of mining machinery, the mind of the designer, of genius, has been at work. He will admit that the percussive rock drill is one of the most difficult pieces of machinery to manipulate continuously that is used on a mine. These machines have only about three inches of piston area, upon which they have to get a considerable strength to make the drill pierce the stone. What differentiates the scientific rock drill from the unscientific machine is the accuracy, and style of the valve, a consideration that is important in order that the mine may have durability, and get satisfactory results from its drills. My honorable friend quoted extensively from the testimonials supplied to him, but it is remarkable that he quoted from none more recent than four years ago. Although the locally-made drills have been nursed on the Kalgoorlie field by a man who originally belonged to Bendigo, and who was one of Bendigo&#39;s strongest protectionists, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Hamilton, manager of the Great Boulder Mine, and although he did his level best to get good results from the Australian rock drill, and has spent a good deal of money in endeavouring to prove its value and perfect it, yet I ask my honorable friend to accept my assurance that the Chamber of Mines, Western Australia, states that there is not one of these Australian drills in use in any important mine in Western Australia to-day. </para>

And why ? My honorable friend, the member for Bendigo, admits that the Australian drill is being sold at the present time for about &#163;27. He also admits that the lowest quotation which could be got for a foreign or English drill in Bendigo was not less than &#163;34. There is a difference of  &#163;7  on the capital cost. If the Australian drill is giving that satisfaction to mining men that the honorable member claims, is it not a most extraordinary thing that men in Bendigo are prepared to pay &#163;34 for an imported rock drill when they could get a satisfactory locally-made drill for  &#163;7  less? That seems to me to be a very strong point. I am assured that the great difficulty in regard to the Australian drill is this : that up to the present time the makers have not been enabled to get the patents associated with the valve gear, so as to be able to produce a satisfactory drill. They cannot produce one which can be worked at the same cost in fuel and consumption of air as the imported drill. I am also assured by mining men, who produce figures in proof of their statement, that it costs about five times as much for the up-keep of the Australian drill as it costs for the up-keep of the more highly developed scientific drill that is usually imported into this country. I am certainly not opposed to giving consideration to the encouragement of the production of this description of machinery, if it can be done without an unreasonable cost to any section of the community. If a proposal were made to Parliament for the inauguration of a system of bounties to promote scientific invention in Australia in regard to rock drills, I should be prepared to give favorable consideration to it. But when we are dealing with our great mining industry we must recollect that the cost of production in many instances is a matter of the existence or non-existence of a mine. The honorable member for Batman will admit that. </para>

                        <para>- Then we are getting on. The passing of a Tariff is not going to put a pennyweight more of gold into the ores that have to be mined and treated; and if our mining managers are not permitted to reduce their mining costs, I have the highest authority for stating that there are a number of mines in Western Australia which are just on the border-line between success and failure, the directors of which will have to consider whether they will be able to keep them going, or will have to close down. I suppose that that is not peculiar to Western Australia either. </para>

                        <para>- There are about 900 in Western Australia altogether. The life of a rock drill is, roughly speaking, five years. So that the utmost advantage which the local makers could expect to get would be to the extent of a couple of hundred rock drills per annum in Queensland. New South Wales, and Victoria. The number used in Australia is about 2,400. In my opinion, the arguments for giving the same treatment to rock drills  as they had under the previous Tariff is unanswerable. I do think that if we are going to endeavour to encourage the improvement and manufacture of these machines in Australia, the best course for us to pursue would be to give consideration to the industry on the lines proposed in regard to the manufacture of iron and its associated products, instead of by imposing a duty which will be injurious to the mining industry. </para>

                    <para>.- Instead of taking our information from the advertisements of firms and being guided 6y testimonials supplied by them, I think that honorable members would be well advised in giving consideration to the evidence adduced before the Tariff Commission. I turn to the report of the protectionist section of the Commission, of which the honorable member for Bendigo was  chairman.  On page 16 of the report on Mining Machinery, there are references to rock drills. I quote this passage - </para>

                    <para>The principal rock drill recognised on the Kalgoorlie mines is that of the IngerrollSergeant Co., of New York. This drill has been worked alongside of and against the Taylor-Horsfield (Bendigo) and other outside makes of &#34;drills, and it has been found that the Ingersoll Sergeant drill bored better and quicker than any other. The mining manager of the Ivanhoe Gold Corporation mine was not able to say which of the drills was responsible for the .greatest consumption of air. It was proposed to make proper comparative tests of the various drills, including Australian, in order to show the exact consumption of air for the boring done per minute,  or  per hour, as the case may be. Whichever was found to be the best would be installed. - (Q. 413S2-5 ; 41486.) </para>

                    <para>Many types of rock drills are in use in Australia. A Victorian engineer (Taylor -Horsfield, of Bendigo), and a South Australian mining manager (Captain Hancock, of Moonta), had designed rock drills, which had considerable improvements on those imported. It was said, however, that under present conditions there was small chance of getting Australian designed and made drills into general use. The &#34;better such drills were &#39; the greater the probability of their being copied by American makers and sent to Australia free (if percussive). The method of American manufacturers was thus described ; when they found a better drill than their own their agent secured samples, sent them to America to be copied ; the&#39;}&#39; were then sent to Australia and sold at any price, until the local manufacturers were knocked out. - (Q. 46487; 46643 ) </para>
                    <para>Percussion rock drills, now duty free, were made locally, but competition with the importer was impossible. A duty of 25 per cent, would enable the local . men to capture the market, and would greatly increase employment. - (Q. 48031.) </para>

                <para class="block">It will be seen from the evidence taken in Western Australia, where rock drill&#39;s are most largely used, that the imported machines are preferred. We may once and for all dismiss the suggestion that mine managers and engineers are prejudiced against local productions. Directors&#39; are not going to run the risk of losing dividends by refusing to use a good machine or tool merely because it is of Australian origin. The suggestion is too ridiculous to bear a moment&#39;s consideration. Prejudice does not enter into this matter. Capable mining managers, working under directors who have made a study of mining, take care to secure the very best machinery available, for they recognise that in that way alone can they hope to profitably develop their properties. Pirating is not confined to the Americans. Reference is made in the report to an improved drill, claimed to have been invented by Captain Hancock, of Moonta. As a matter of fact, the patent was really the invention of a resident of Stawell, Victoria, but a clever workman employed by Captain Hancock at a wage, I suppose, of about 7s. 6d. per day, added to it an improved jacket, and his employer took credit for the improvement. </para>

                        <para>- It was not ; the new jacket was the only improvement, and the resident of Stawell to whom I have referred received a good many pounds by way of royalty from Captain Hancock, after learning that he had been using it. Another idle suggestion has been offered that certain mining companies are making an effort to push imported drills on the market. I have not heard of mining companies entering into arrangements with a trust to push any drill. The inducement offering would not be sufficient to lead them to undertake the work. The statement embodied in the report of the Commission as to the drills most favored in Western Australia, is supported by the experience of the Great Cobar Copper Mine in my own electorate. The manager, who is an Australian, and therefore naturally prejudiced in favour of Australian goods, has been trying different drills and keeping a record of the cost of repairs. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has referred to the valve on the Australian drill which cuts very rapidly. A little pin running on a slot, and causing the drill to revolve, wears out rapidly because of the speed at which it revolves, and it has constantly to be repaired. After experimenting with three or four drills, the manager of the Great Cobar Mine found that the Ingersoll-Rand Drill was the best, the cost of repairs to it during a period of twelve months amounting to only12s. 6d., as against an expenditure of&#163;4 10s. on repairs to the Australian drill. </para>

                        <para>- The imposition of a high duty on rock drills will not prevent the use of the imported machine. It will simply handicap the mining industry. Why should we punish the mining industry when by doing, so we can do no good for the local manufacturers of drills? I have here the statement made in a circular sent to honorable members by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> mining engineer of Western Australia, and a man of large experience in mining. He estimates the total annual consumption of drills in the Commonwealth at between 400 and 500, and gives the running age of a drill at about five years. He puts the cost of these drills at about ,&#163;50 each, which is considerably higher than we are told is the present cost of the machines. As it has been opened up, I suppose the discussion on this item will be concluded ; but I. think the Committee should favorably consider the proposal of the honorable member for Newcastle to omit boring machinery from this item. I appeal to the Committee to let the mining industry have a few of the implements required to carry it on admitted at a reasonable rate of duty. I appeal to honorable members also to be guided by the views of men who have to handle these drills, which are likely to be more reliable than the opinions expressed in advertisements published by firms who have drills for sale. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with attention to the previous speakers on this item. We have in connexion with this item again to consider the questions of monopoly and protection. Before Victorian manufacturers of these drills entered into competition for the trade, the price of drills was ^80 apiece. I wish the Committee to bear that in mind. Since we have had local competition for &#39;these machines, the price has come down, and I am given to understand that they can now be purchased for about ^30 each. The honorable member for Darling spoke of the annual cost of repairs, as amounting in the case of the imported to 12s. 6d., as against <inline font-style="italic">-&#163;4</inline> 10s. for the locally-manufactured machine. In answer to that, let me inform honorable members that the deepest shaft in Australia was sunk 252 feet with a locally-made drill, at a cost for repairs of only is. per foot. The honorable member also informed the Committee that straps were used in connexion with the locally-made drill. I know of no straps being used in connexion with, them, and I have worked both imported and&#39; locally-made drills. </para>

                        <para>- At Maldon. Perhaps the honorable, member would like to know the time, as well as the place? I am prepared to have an imported drill worked alongside a Taylor-Horsfield National drill, and if the latter will not bore&#34; 5 feet more quickly, and use less air in doing so, I shall be prepared to admit the imported drills free. I wish to say that Victorian manufacturers should be credited with bringing this machine up-to-date. When these drills were first imported it took three men to earl them around. The pistons of the imported drills were so brittle that if one broke it could not be repaired, and had to be replaced at a cost of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;j</inline> 10s. Australian manufacturers have succeeded in manufacturing a piston that can be repaired. In the next place, the chuck attached to the piston of the imported drills was of so brittle a character that in working pieces of metal- became detached and workmen were injured in this way. The Australian manufacturers&#39; have; improved the machine in that direction also. But what do we- find to-day ? We find the company which has been referred to adopting the Australian chuck, and putting it on to their machines. </para>

Australian manufacturers have made improvements upon the machine, and brought the price down from _&#163;8o to ,&#163;30, under the operation of a protective duty of 25 per cent., which was in force in Victoria prior to Federation. Now we are being asked to allow the imported drill to come in practically free. The honorable member for Coolgardie referred to Western Australia, and let me say that the deepest mine in that State is only 2,500 feet deep, whilst .&#39;the deepest mine in Bendigo is 4,000 feet deep. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly it is, and the difficulty of working is greater. I ask honorable members why the miners at Long Tunnel prefer the local to the imported drill, where they might use either? In carrying out a contract at Walhalla at the present time the miners prefer to use the local drill, and yet we are told that the Trust at the back of the imported drill should be allowed to flood Australia with their machines. Under the protective Tariff of Victoria, the wages in one foundry alone totalled &#163;10,000 a year; but since Federation, only  &#163;6,000  a year has been paid in wages. Would the mining industry have benefited in the way it has done in this connexion, but for the protective Tariff of Victoria?  1  say it would not. It was the operation of that Tariff that brought down the price of the drill, and now we are being asked to place this machine on the free list that the importers may secure a monopoly, and put up the price again. These drills are being made in many parts of Victoria, and I believe also in South Australia. There is plenty of local competition, and, to secure orders, the local manufacturers of drills are obliged to sell them practically at cost price. I venture to say that no member of the Committee can tell me the exact price now being paid for the imported article. The importers try to secure a monopoly by saying, &#34;We will let you have our machine at a certain price if you agree to use no other in connexion with your mine.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I am not. This is not a Victorian question ; it is a Western Australian question. Honorable members have not been able to show that the locally-made drills cannot do the work required of them. A test took place three years ago in Western Australia, and the Taylor-Horsfield National machine beat the imported machine out of sight. The men who have to use these drills are the best judges of their value, and I have shown that they prefer to use the locally-made drills. That is being proved at Broken Hill at the present time, where men on contract are using Australian in preference to imported drills. In Australia to-day, over 131 mines are using locally-made drills. </para>

                        <para>- I am grumbling because some honorable members wish that imported machines should be admitted free, when they can be made in Australia.  1  ask honorable members who are in favour of a protective Tariff which will give employment to labour, to impose such a duty on these machines as will encourage the use of the locally-made article. I have not the slightest doubt that if we can place the locally-made machines in mines throughout Australia, they will be found to do the work as well in the future as they are shown to have done it in the past. The only reasons urged against the proposed duty have been from the importers&#39; stand-point, and I venture to say that behind the move being made to-night, there is the importer if he could be seen. </para>

                        <para>- Five hundred. Under the Victorian Tariff, one foundry alone was paying &#163;10,000 a year in wages, but since the duty was taken off, it is only paying &#163;6,000 a year. I have clearly shown that this machine is capable of doing the work, and that one foundry alone has turned out 3,000 of them. On a test it showed itself equal in every way to the  imported machine. &#39; Its manufacture has been the means of reducing the price. The honorable member for Flinders the other night said that he was prepared to vote for the proposals of the Government on a certain item, because they were framed in relation to the Excise duties. I trust that honorable members who are in favour of protection, or who take the view held by the honorable member for Flinders, will vote on this item to keep out the imported article, and to give employment to men who are now out of work. There has not been a single reason advanced why rock drills should be struck out, and I trust the Committee will vote for the highest protection it is possible to get. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Batman made a very fine speech in favour of the Australian-made rock drill, and satisfied me that its manufacturers are doing a roaring business. He states that 500 or 600 drills are in use in Victoria, attach a good deal of weight to what was&#39; said by the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission. Although he quoted from a trade circular, it is not fair to say that what he quoted was not correct. The drills to which the &#39; honorable member for Bendigo referred are to be found in some of the principal mines in Western Australia.  J. was upon the fields some months ago, and saw the Bayley&#39;s Reward claim.. There was no reason to suppose from its appearance that the best of everything had not been put into it. It was closed down because they could not get gold, and not because the drill did not do its work. It is no part of my business here to run down a colonial production. I believe that the Australian drill is a good one, but, so far as I can gather from the evidence quoted by the honorable member for Darling, the imported drill will do the work quicker and better. Still that does not mean that the local drill will not do its work. The honorable member for Bendigo quoted an extract which showed that- there had been some competition between the two drills, and that the colonial article was a first-class one. Still, the imported  drill is so much better that the makers can afford to keep its price above that of the colonial article. The honorable member for Batman stated that its owners will only allow people to buy the imported machines if a guarantee is given that they will not use the colonial article. But only a man who is sure of his ground will make such a stipulation. If his machine were inferior, he would be told, &#34; I do not want your machine, and would not have it on those terms.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I thought the honorable member pointed out that the imported machine costs &#163;&#93; more than does the local drill. That is not a very large difference, especially to rich mines. Apparently the difference- between the two machines is small, or the difference in price would be greater. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has stated over and over again that, as a protectionist, he would not agree to placing on the free list any article which can be produced here of good quality. But where is the honorable member on this item? Let him. vote with the protectionists. All through the Tariff, a large amount of protection has been giver* for articles of excellent manufacture that will do their work. If that is to&#39; be the policy the protectionist ought to stand by the colonial article. While I am in favour of free competition in manufactures, and would open our ports to allow the best articles to come in, so as to keep the local maker up to the highest pitch of efficiency, I would not say that the imported article should be taken in preference to the colonial. All things being equal, I should give the choice to the colonial article. I have come to the conclusion that in this case the colonial rock drill is not quite so good as is the imported machine, and, if that is so, we should allow the latter tc&#187;. come in. But the local manufacturers have nothing to fear, because everybody in Victoria uses their machine. The honorable member for Bendigo has pointed out that at immense depths it is better than any other. My desire is to have the local article made as good as is the American or English production. That&#39; will never be brought about unless the imported machine is allowed free entry to our markets. The local machine also has the advantage of the local prejudice in its favour ; otherwise, it would not be so largely used. Although it is proved that it is not quite so good, its makers can thrive in spite of the competition of the imported article. A low duty would therefore satisfy all requirements. </para>

                    <para>.- I favour the suggestion of the honorable member for. Newcastle, for the addition of a separate item in this case with a lower rate of duty. </para>

                <para class="block">Hut I cannot agree with those who suggest that the item should be practically free. It is ridiculous to suppose that we are not able, with our large mining interests, to make rock drills in Australia, and it is idle to suggest that the manufacturers should be given no assistance through the Tariff in order to enable them to compete with the machines that come from America, Great Britain, and Germany. But, on the other hand, to put a high duty upon the Ingersoll;Sargent and the Rand drills would be doing an injustice to the mining community. None of these mines are in any sense philanthropic bodies, nor do I imagine that the question enters very much into the consideration of the directors or mining managers as to whether a drill is made in Bendigo or America, but the managers - many of whom, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Hamilton and others who have been mentioned, are at the very top of their profession - have unquestionably a strong desire to secure a machine which will do the work effectively and cheaply, and in such a way as will allow the miner to show the most satisfactory results. I&#39; do not wish to prejudice, by any remark of mine, the drill which is made in Australia, but the bulk of testimony from the managers of large mines throughout the Commonwealth will show that the mining industry has good reason for urging that a prohibitive duty shall not be put upon an article which has proved itself to be so serviceable. That is due to the fact that the makers of three great drills have joined together, and, as Edison does in America, have their agents all over the world to ascertain what improvements or changes are being made, and secure them. Consequently there is no possibility of an Australian manufacturer ever being in such a completely satisfactory position as to have at his command all the latest ideas and practical improvements in the way the great combinations have. I shall, therefore, favour a lower duty than the one proposed bv the Government. Some assistance and help should unquestionably be given to the manufacturers, not only in Victoria, but in all the other States. But I do not approve of a duty which would prevent drills of a higher class being introduced for use in the mines here. This drill is being used in some of the mines in Broken Hill and Tasmania, and has found its way to the West; and it would be unjust to our local manufacturers to say that their manufacture does not deserve consideration, seeing that it has been adopted by most capable and able managers. I shall support the suggestion to have this appliance put into a separate line, but I shall ask the Committee to impose a higher duty than that proposed by the honorable member. I think a fair compromise would be to have a duty of 20 per cent, in both columns. </para>

                    <para>.- I intend to support the proposal of the honorable member for Newcastle. Australian-made rock drills are sold in the local market at a. cheaper rate than are the imported drills, and, that being so, I do not see why any more protection is required. The Australian consumption of rock drills is about 5 per cent, of the world&#39;s consumption, and, if the idea of imposing a duty is to compel the foreign manufacturer to establish works here, I do not think it will have the desired effect. To make it worth while for a foreign maker to put down the necessary expensive plant in Australia, there would have to be an output of 2,500 drills annually, whereas the Australian consumption is about 400 or 500. These facts appeal to me as a business man, and, in mv opinion, the duties will be excessive if they exceed <inline font-style="italic">10</inline> per cent, and 5 per cent. The Hollmann drill is composed of very fine material, which is not available in Australia ; and which, in case of the manufacture being carried on here, would have to be imported, thus adding to the cost pf production. Nearly every part of this drill is protected by patent rights ; and therefore I do not see how any good can arise from an increased duty, unless the makers are compelled to put down a plant in Australia. The great desideratum in mining is cheapness in working ; and, notwithstanding what so great an authority as the honorable member for Kooyong has said, there are many propositions in Australia which would employ thousands of men if, by means of scientific improvement, they could gain a little advantage in this connexion. In Western Australia there are many old mining propositions which, with a little cheaper working ensured, would become good going concerns. If a mine be shut down, or a proposition is prevented from maturing, more men will be thrown out of employment than could find work were the whole of the market for this appliance confined to Australian manufactures. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to point out to the Committee that in the electorate of Darwin, Tasmania, there are enormous mineral propositions which are just below a remunerative working price. If these could be worked with the aid of up-to-date machinery, they would employ thousands of miners. It is all very well for the honorable member for Kooyong to urge that the difference between the rates of duty proposed will not affect the working of the mines.  His  contention is perfectly accurate so far as mines like those of Mount Morgan, Mount Lyell, and Broken Hill are concerned. But there are many smaller propositions which would be severely handicapped if we imposed a duty of  30  per cent. upon rock-drills. I have never attempted to decry our local manufactures, and I do not say&#39; that the drills made in the Commonwealth are not excellent for some purposes. Roughly speaking, the price of the imported article is about  &#163;44,  so that a duty of  30  per cent. would be equivalent to about  &#163;14.  That is the increased amount which the users of these machines will be called upon to pay under the Government proposal. The locally manufactured drill is being sold to-day for less than is the imported article. It is the acme of absurdity for honorable member&#39;s to declare that men will purchase the imported in preference to the Australian article as the result of mere prejudice. </para>

                        <para>- I have been informed by a reliable authority that it is  &#163;44.  But, assuming that it is  &#163;27,  an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate of30 per cent. would very nearly enhance its cost by one-third. The honorable member for Batman has argued at considerable length that the local drill is superior to the imported article. If that be so, surely there is no justification for the imposition of a duty of  30  per cent. </para>

                        <para>- But English firms have already secured half of the trade, and they ask for no preference as against the trust. The honorable member for Batman mentioned the fact that a shaft had Been sunk at Bendigo by means of drills of Australian manufacture at a cost for re pairs of only1s. per foot. I may inform him that at the Princess Royal Mine, Norseman, a shaft was sunk several hundred feet at a cost for repairs of only 7d. per foot. These figures, however, convey nothing, because so much depends upon the character of the ground. 1 hope that the Committee will vote in favour of the lower duty. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sorry that honorable members should have spoken disparagingly of the locally manufactured drill. I have had considerable experience of these drilling machines in connexion with the Long Tunnel Company, at Walhalla. There we sank a shaft  2,800  feet in twenty months. The men employed, who were first-class shaft sinkers, sunk as much as  160  feet per month, which, I think, constitutes a world&#39;s record. They started by using Taylor-Horsfield drills. They were allowed to use whatever machines they chose. After they had been working some time, acting on the advice of our mining engineer, we substituted American drills. But the men speedily reverted to the Australian machines. The fact that they sank  160  feet per month through granitic rock is convincing testimony of the value of these machines. </para>

                        <para>- We advertised all over Australia for expert shaft sinkers, and we agreed to pay them a bonus for every foot that they sank in excess of  100  feet per month. We were only too pleased to do so. When the locally manufactured drill can accomplish the work that I have outlined, no complaint can be urged against it. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. We car only judge of the relative merits of these machines by instituting very severe tests over long periods. That a test has been made at some sports counts for nothing The men who are managing the biggest mines in Australia, and in whom the share holders and directors of the largest mining companies have confidence, men who have been dealing in machinery of this kind year after year, are most competent to judge of its merits. I do not say that drills should be admitted free of duty. It is a question of tools of trade again. Rock-drills are the tools of trade of shaft-sinkers and miners. Men very often take contracts to do work of this kind finding their own explosives and machinery. If the Australian drill is so much better than the imported drill, why has it not possession of the market, seeing that it costs only  &#163;27  as against  &#163;34? </para>

                        <para>- Victoria is not all Australia. The States are now federated; but if this talk of Victoria being all Australia continues, it will affect their good feeling to each other. Australia is a very big country, and cannot be governed wholly in accordance with the views of the people of Melbourne or of Bendigo. Men whose employers consider them worth salaries of  &#163;3,000  or  &#163;4,000  a year to manage mines should be the most capable judges of what is the best machinery to use in those mines. The talk we have heard about American trusts has no weight with me, because some of the best drills that come to this country are British. . The honorable member for Batman proved more than he intended to prove. Statistics show that Australia requires  500  new rock drills annually, so that if Victoria had the whole business of manufacturing drills, the work would not give employment to  500  persons as stated by the honorable member for Batman ; that would be only one drill per man per annum. The honorable member for Darling bears me out in the contention that it is necessary that the big mining companies, such as the Great Cobar Company, should have up-to-date machinery, and should be allowed to say what machinery is best for their purposes. A drill which might suit one kind of rock might not suit another. We have listened to a great many so-called experts to-night; but I claim to have some knowledge of this subject, because I have driven underground, through hard rock - bluestone and granite - for a length of half a mile at a time, and I know that a drill which will do good work in one shaft or tunnel may not do good work in another. Any one who knows anything about rock drilling will support that statement. Indeed, men who have been accustomed to deal with one particular kind of rock, if taken to another place where the rock is different, and given the drill to which they are used, will often prove practically useless, and their drills, too. The honorable member for Bendigo says that the drills which he mentioned have been used at the Queensland Menzies mine, at Bayley&#39;s mine, and at one or two others, all of which are now closed. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say. Honorable members must draw their own conclusions. No doubt the drills have been used in mines which are still at work, and are doing well ; but the fact that they have been used in mines which are now closed, does not show them to be any better than other drills. Had they proved so good as to be able to keep the mines going, there would have been something to say for them. Honorable members have a great deal to say of that small portion of Australia called Victoria, and of the little bit of mining which goes on here. But they forget that nowadays Western Australia produces more gold per annum than all the other States put together. </para>

                        <para>- I am not now dealing with &#34; has-beens.&#34; Seeing that Western Australia now produces more gold than all the other States of the Commonwealth put together, she should be allowed a voice in choosing what tools shall be used in her mines.&#34; If Victoria, considering the small amount of gold she produces, were allowed to dictate to Western Australia in this matter, it would be a case of the tail wagging the dog. The tail should wait until the dog wags it, and Western Australia is certainly the dog so far as mining goes. I do not ask that rock drills be treated differently from other tools of trade, or that they be admitted free to the detriment of local manufacturers. But the proposed rates of duty are unreasonably high. I am willing to vote for a duty of  15  per cent. </para>

                        <para>- That would be a fairer rate. No doubt, rock drills can be made in Australia. Whether they are as good as imported drills is for those concerned to say ; but I do not think that they can <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> as good, because I have not heard of them being exported, and when manufacturers are making a better article than is being turned out by others in the same&#39; line, they can always sell it, either in or out of Australia. Take, for instance, harvesters. I understand that a large number of these machines are exported to Argentine. That, to my mind, shows very conclusively that when the Australian harvester comes into competition with harvesters of the world in other markets, it is able to hold its- own. The same thing would apply to the rock drills. If, as the honorable member for Balaclava has stated, the Australian rock drills are better than the imported article, I cannot understand why there is not a foreign market as well as a home market for them. I am prepared to give a reasonable duty to the makers of rock drills to see if they cannot in time compete with the imported &#34;articles. At the same time, T think that duties of 30 and 25 per cent, are too high. </para>

                        <para>- Those rates are, I think, too high. Originally the Minister asked for duties of 30 and 25 per cent, not only on rock drills, but also on the other articles included in this item. He has a majority at his back, and it may be that if he attempts to carry his new proposal to levy duties of 25 and 20 per cent, on all these articles he will win. But. we maybe able to carry an amendment against him&#39; so far as rock drills are concerned. In that event I would vote for rock drills to be made free, but I would prefer that all the articles in the item should be dutiable at 20 and 15 per cent, respectively, because there are other things which are as helpful to the mining industry as are rock drills. I realize that it is one of the greatest industries in Australia. If honorable members cripple the mining and pastoral industries, what will be left? Those great industries certainly maintain the other industries. Anything which honorable members can do to help the mining industry will be to the advantage of Australia generally, because, I venture to say, that there is no industry which finds such diversified employment for people as it does. Not only does a mine find work for the miner, but it also finds work for an engineer and a carpenter on the spot, besides providing employment for engineers, carpenters and other artisans elsewhere. It also keeps stores going. With two or three mines in a locality, a township, generally springs up. </para>

                    <para>. - The discussion on this item has centred round the quality of rock drills and. their relative prices. The price of the imported article is about 25 per cent, more than that of the locally-made article, and the latter has had the benefit of a protective duty of 12^ per cent. </para>

                        <para>- If they did that only strengthens the argument I propose to use. I am connected with two small mines. We purchased seven or eight Taylor-Horsfield rock drills, with which we have been well pleased. Evidently these rock drills have established a market. Some conflicting statements have been made. The honorable member for Bendigo has quoted some testimonials which were given before the mines in which the rock drills were used were shut down : but the honorable member&#39; for Balaclava has quoted a very good testimonial, and it is confirmed by my own experience, because in the small mines I have alluded to we have done some wonderful driving work. If the locally-made rock drill has been able to hold its own, as it has done, an import duty of  30  per cent. is excessive. Under the old Tariff the original duty on nearly all mining requirements was  12&#189;  per cent. But under this Tariff, in almost every instance, the Government have proposed duties of  25  and  30  per cent., and it has only been after a very heavy struggle that we have been able to secure some reduction in the rates. It has been truly said by honorable members that the mining industry is a great one. In my electorate it has kept two or three townships going. Surely it is only fair to assume that the increased duties are likely to do considerable injury. The honorable member for Bendigo did not tell everything in connexion with the locally-made rock drill. I am informed that about three years ago a trial took place between the imported Hollmann machine and the locally-made machine, that the whole of the mining managers of Bendigo gave the palm to the former; and that it is being used by the bulk of the mines in Bendigo. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot help that. I am dealing with a proposal of the Treasurer which, if carried, will involve a huge additional expenditure in connexion with Che mining industry. The other night the honorable member for Kooyong stated that the increased duties on mining machinery meant an immediate additional cost of nearly  &#163;250,000  to the mines throughout the Commonwealth. I also have been informed on reliable authority that the increased duties will cause a very considerable increase in the expenditure on those mines. For instance, a duty of  30  per cent. on  500  rock drills would realize about &#163;30,000. What is the use of building up an industry and then crushing it out of existence ? I know that in this very city the interests in connexion with mining companies are so great that they have almost created a slight financial paralysis. If we keep on increasing the duties on item after item, what will be the result? It is all very well for some honorable members to say that the Government are proposing an increase of only  7&#189;  or  10  or  15  per cent., as compared with the duty under the old Tariff. But if we impose an increased duty on every one of nearly  600  items, we shall impose upon the people a burden which they cannot afford to bear. I recognise that we must have increased duties. </para>

                <para class="block">But suppose, for the sake of argument, that the duty on a mining requirement was  12&#189;  per cent. under the old Tariff. Surely an increase to  20  per cent. is fair, and an increase to  30  per cent. unfair. When a locally-made piece of machinery can be sold at  25  per cent. less than the cost of the imported article, honorable members should hesitate before they impose an excessive duty. I recognise that it is no use trying to get the duty down to what I consider would be a fair rate. As the industry for which the duty is proposed is a going concern, there is no need for it to be propped up and buttressed. Surely a going concern does not require more than a reasonable duty. In this instance the old story of protection cheapening the article is not a factor in determining the issue. The Government Whip sits at the table while this debate is going on, and takes more responsibility on his shoulders than do Ministers themselves. When an honorable member is endeavouring to speak intelligently to the subject, nothing but talk goes on between that honorable member, who ought to be sitting on one of the back benches, and the Minister. He interjects frequently in an impertinent manner, and is constantly in evidence when he should be behind the scenes. Every honorable member has a right to express his opinion, and it is not my fault that I have to speak at five minutes to  11  o&#39;clock&#39;. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister is the man who ought to be called to order. We have heard a great deal about the relative qualities of machinery. Many names have been mentioned. Some of them are household words. I have heard mentioned the names of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Nicholson,</inline> and others who acquired their knowledge of mining in Victoria. Some of them were born and bred in this State, and went away from here biased in favour of everything Victorian. When they have&#34; had to give up the use of the locally-made machines and to adopt the imported article, I say that this Committee ought to hesitate before it consents to add duty upon duty against an industry which, in many instances, I can say to my own personal knowledge, cannot afford to bear these increased burdens. I trust that the Treasurer will review the position, and will adopt the conclusion of the honorable member for Barrier, who has urged that duties of 15 per cent. and 20 per cent. should be adopted. I shall support those duties. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not desire to compare the respective qualities of imported and locally-manufactured machines. But we have already approved of duties on machine tools at 15 per cent. in both columns. I cannot see why, if a duty of 15 per cent. is sufficient in the case of other machine tools, the same duty should not be adopted as applying to the machine tools of the mining industry. We shall not be acting consistently by doing so. It will not be defensible to vote lesser duties in the case of industries of minor importance than we vote on account of this immense industry. If we are to act consistently, we should agree to a duty of1 5 per cent. in both columns. </para>

                    <para>.- Like the honorable member for Indi, I am a business man, and want to get to business on this matter. In my opinion, we should vote duties of 20 per cent. and 15 per cent. as to paragraphs  a, b,  andc, and of 15 per cent. in both columns as to the proposed paragraph  d. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Government will retain the 25 per cent. duty for the item generally, but will, in regard to rock drills, make the duties 20 per cent. and 1 5 per cent. It is unnecessary to reiterate <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam</inline> the arguments in favour of different treatment for rock drills. I am not an alarmist, like the honorable member for Indi. Listening to his remarks, one might think that the whole mining industry would be killed if we did not allow rock drills to come in free ; but I have more faith in the mining industry than to think that. This is only a very small item, but I justify the position that I take up on the ground that other tools of trade have been made dutiable at only 15 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend who has made about four speeches to-night begins to interject as soon as I rise. I wish to make one or two observations concerning the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission, who has been here for two days purporting to give us information from the reports furnished for the guidance of honorable members. I very much regret that the honorable member appears to me to speak always as the protectionist propagandist of this House, and not as  Chairman  of the Commission. </para>

                        <para>- He does; but he quotes only the evidence of interested individuals. On no occasion has he made allusion to any statement made contrary to his views. In quoting from the reports of the protectionist section of the Commission he has invariably singled out the statement of an interested manufacturer who intimated that he could do this or that if he had certain duties. Would he accept such evidence in a Court of law? He knows that outside the Tariff Commission it is not worth a snap of the fingers. It is about time that we had less of interested evidence quoted from the reports, and more of the evidence as it appears fairly in them. </para>

                        <para>- An abundance of evidence on the other side has been quoted during the debate. Is the honorable member unaware of that evidence? Did the Commission take evidence from only a few interested manufacturers? If so, what are the reports worth? I do not regard the evidence of one or two interested manufacturers as of conclusive value in determining this question. Were no mining managers examined? </para>

                        <para>- I am not discussing the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission ; I am merely making an allusion to his readings during the last two days from the reports of the protectionist section of the Commission. I have done with the matter; but I think it a pity that the other side in this and many other cases has not been presented. I could understand the honorable member for Batman bringing his brief into the House and reading it with gusto, as he always does, but we expect a little more from a man of the standing of the honorable member for Bendigo, having regard more particularly to the responsibility of the position which he lately held. What are the facts in regard to this item ? I do not pretend to be an expert on rock drills, but I have listened to the debate with a keen desire to understand the rights and wrongs of the question. I confess that the discussion has left me perplexed and puzzled. I am perfectly satisfied that good machinery can be made in Australia, and that the rock drills made in this State are excellent of their kind. But the point which has been borne upon my mind is that those drills do not work equally well in every class of country. That is plain to any one who has listened to the conflicting statements made during the debate. Whilst they may have performed the boring feat to which the honorable member for Balaclava has referred, it does not follow that they would do equally good work in the rocks of Western Australia and elsewhere. I should like to know whether the honorable member for Kooyong and that huge company with which he is so honorably connected - and which is so well conducted - are in the habit of buying imported machines, when they can obtain better ones locally-made, at a cheaper rate. </para>

                        <para>- A statement was made to-night that tenders were called by a Broken Hill Company for boring machinery, and that it paid a larger price for an imported machine than was quoted for a local production. I apprehend that they treated that tender on pure business lines, and there must, therefore, be some preference in the minds of practical men engaged in the mining industry for these imported drills for certain purposes. All the statements to the contrary do not tend to clear up the matter. The honorable member for Batman might say that the locally-made machines do their work at a cost of1s. per foot; but he is met by the honorable member for Darling, who says that the imported machine does the work at yd. per foot. We must have some more reliable authority ; and listening to the conflicting statements which have been made, I prefer to accept those made by men responsible for the conduct of mining operations, the expert mining managers of Australia, who, I believe, if they have a prejudice at all, would favour the productions of the country in which they have been trained and received their experience. These gentlemen declare that so far as mining in Western Australia is concerned, they must have these imported rock drills. </para>

                    <para>. - A most unfair and improper attack has been made on the honorable member for Bendigo to-night by the honorable member for Parramatta. For many weeks protectionist members of the Committee, who had a right to look to the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission for assistance and guidance in these matters, have been deprived of any assistance whatever by reason of the illness and absence of the honorable member for Bendigo from this chamber. </para>

                        <para>- We have not had a member of the protectionist section of the Commission in the chamber during all these weeks, but we have had thrust down our throats page after page of the reports of the free-trade section of the Commission by the honorable members for Illawarra and. Perth, who were members of that section. They have given us nothing but free-trade evidence and conclusions, and now, because we are at last getting some little assistance from the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission, who was one of the protectionist members of the Commission, and was selected to be a member of the Commission because he was a protectionist, we have a member of the Freetrade party denouncing the action of the honorable member, and reminding him that he occupies a judicial position. Such was not his position. We know very well that the members of the Commission were appointed because of the fiscal views they were known to hold, and they have presented two sets of reports in accordance with those views. We could only expect from either section of the Commission conclusions representing their particular views. In the circumstances, I think the attack made upon the honorable member for Bendigo was improper and most unfair. On the question of rock drills we have had many statements, made by different members as to what some one else told them, but we had one very practical piece of evidence in the short and pithy speech of the honorable member for Balaclava, who, as a director of a mining company by whom various drills were tried- </para>

                        <para>- Very well ; if my remark, that where protection is concerned the only thing the honorable member knows is potatoes be regarded as offensive, I will say that the honorable member knows nothing about potatoes. The honorable member for Balaclava gave us his experience as a director of a mining company in connexion with the sinking of the great incline shaft at the Long Tunnel, at Walhalla. He has told us that the staff employed to carry out that work was advertised for and collected from all parts of Australia, and these are the men who selected the Australian drills for the work in preference to the other drills given them to use. That is practical evidence which comes nearer home to the question than any other evidence submitted to the Committee this evening. Like the honorable member for Parramatta, I know nothing of the subject beyond what I have heard, but the evidence to which I have just referred weighs heavily with me. So far as protectionist&#39;s are concerned I claim in this connexion the vote of many protectionists in this chamber. When we have honorable members like the honorable member for Indi, who continually gets up here- </para>

                    <para>. - I have suggested to the Minister to omit the word &#34; boring,&#34; so that the question of rock drills may be dealt with in a separate paragraph  d,  and have asked the Minister to propose rock-boring machines at a duty of 20 per cent. I find, on examining our report, that we recommended the omission of rock drills from the free list, and thereby they would fall automatically under &#34; manufactures of metals, n.e.i., 20 per cent.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I quite admit that, but, at the same time, the pairs are recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and in the newspapers, and when an honorable member goes away  and makes a pair, good faith ought to be kept. The following is the reply . I have received from the leader of the Opposition - </para>

                        <para>- I point out that I did not interrupt the honorable member for Lang. Pairs are constantly being made between members and constantly altered, and they are bound to be altered on both sides, in order to suit the convenience of honorable <inline font-style="italic">members. On</inline> this particular occasion, the Minister of Defence gave the leader of the Opposition a pair, and the honorable member for Angas gave the honorable member for Corio a pair. But the honorable member for Angas has been voting, and so we transferred the pair of the honorable member for Corio to the leader of the Opposition, just as during the last week, when the honorable member for Parkes had paired with the honorable member for Macquarie, he voted on every occasion, his pair having been transferred by the Opposition Whip. </para>

                    <para>.- There is some misapprehension created by what the Government Whip has said. I was paired with the honorable member for Corio until last Tuesday. Being detained by important business I did not arrive at the House until Wednesday, and, in case the honorable member might have an idea that he was still paired, he not having returned, I asked the Government Whip whether he expected me to continue the pair on the Wednesday. The Government Whip said &#34; No,&#34; and, of course, I voted. </para>

                    <para>. - Since the acting leader of the Opposition has asked me to make a statement I have no objection to doing so. The leader of the Opposition towards the end of last week asked whether I would pair with him as he was going to Sydney, and I said I had no objection. I consulted the Government Whip, who said that the pair was quite satisfactory. I have no desire to find fault with regard to the length of the pair, but I had no idea that it was for beyond the Tuesday ; and I think I said so at the time to both the Government Whip and the Opposition Whip. I do not desire to raise any question about that, however, because I know these loosely-made agreements very frequently give rise to misapprehension. I know that pairs are constantly being changed in the way that has been described. In the early part of the pair I did not vote, and once or twice the Postmaster-General did not vote ; all the changes were absolutely fair. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not desire to address the Committee at any length upon this question. I bad intended to do so earlier in the evening, but the debate turned upon one matter, in which I was not specially interested. In the proposal which is now under consideration, however, the whole of our mining interests are involved. If honorable members will turn to the Budget statement, and to the papers connected with it which were laid upon the table of the House by the Treasurer, they will find that from 1902 to 1906 inclusive, the mining industry exported wealth to the amount of &#163;104,225,000. As against that, the export of machinery, implements, and manufactures of metals was valued at only &#163;469,000. In this connexion it must be remembered that the product of the mining industry has to find its market in the outside world. Notwithstanding this, there are large numbers of persons engaged in the industry who are not working rich mineral fields, but fields upon which the margin between profit and loss is a very narrow one. Yet it is now proposed to increase the taxation upon mining machinery from 12&#189; per cent. to 25 per cent. under the general Tariff and to 20 per cent. under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. I would further remind honorable members that this industry employs about 112,000 labourers, as compared with some 16,000 who are employed in the whole of the machine and metal manufacturing industries of the Commonwealth. I desire to call the attention of honorable members to the different treatment which is accorded to the mining industry by other protectionist countries. I find that in item 222 of the New Zealand Tariff it is specified that steam engines and parts thereof, including the boiler or boilers therefor, imported specially for mining or gold saving purposes and processes or for dairying purposes, are dutiable at 5 per cent. Again, in item 439 I find that machinery for gold-saving purposes and processes has been placed upon the free list. That is the treatment which the industry receives in a country which believes in a protective policy, but which does not believe in penalizing its large primary industries. A similar remark is applicable to the Dominion of Canada. </para>

                        <para>- I refrained from speaking earlier in the debate in the hope that a reasonable duty would be agreed to. But instead of securing a duty of 20 per cent. - which I was prepared to accept - the Committee have imposed a duty of 25 per cent. upon mining machinery under the general Tariff. Consequently I have no alternative but to fight for the insertion of a reasonable rate in the preference column. In Canada all the important machinery used for mining purposes is upon a list of special exemptions. The case of the Wilberforce Gold Dredging Company has already been cited. There is also the case of the Cobar Company, which recently ordered machinery to cost about &#163;71,000, of which about &#163;47,000 worth was to come from England and about &#163;23,000 worth from America. Under the old Tariff the duty - 12&#189; per cent. - would have been about &#163;8,800, but if 25 per cent., and the preferential duty of 20 per cent., is charged it will be increased by &#163;17,000, and will come to &#163;25,987. About &#163;9,000 or &#163;10,000 worth of machinery included in the order was previously on the free list, but is now dutiable at 25 per cent. That is an instance of the way in which one of our great primary industries, which has been a source of enormous wealth to the country, is being burdened, so that it will become more difficult for those connected with it to obtain decent wages.

                        <para>- Because it earns many thousands of pounds profit. It is controlled by a London company, which orders all its requirements from England and from America. I am credibly informed that a large part of its plant, consisting of blast furnaces, smelters, converters, and accessories, all of which could have been purchased in Australia for no more than was paid for it, was imported. The company, when it started, imported even its columns and girders, showing that it is capable of resorting to any device to avoid purchasing in Australia. It has already been determined in connexion with similar items that the rates of duty shall be 25 and 20 per cent., and if the free-traders try to force a reduction to 15 per cent. in connexion with importations from the United Kingdom, I hope that the protectionists will insist on an all-round duty of 25 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - What was said in connexion with the proposal to tax rock drills applies with a hundredfold more force to the proposal to tax ore-reducing appliances. It is absolutely necessary to encourage the use of the best and latest ore-dressing and ore-reducing appliances, as they do in other countries, in order that our very low-grade ores may be worked to advantage. The Simmer and Jack Mine, by far the largest gold-producing mine in the world, which uses 600 head of stamps, is working on a 6-dwt. reef. But it can do so only by using the latest and most up-to-date appliances. Here in Australia we have many hundreds of low-grade propositions, and we can work them profitably only by using the most up-to-date appliances. The mining industry, instead of employing a few handfuls of men, as some of the manufacturing industries do, gives work to tens of thousands. We ought to try to give those who put their money into mines a fair chance to profit by their investments. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has had a great deal to say about the mining companies importing their requirements, but we are very glad to get money from abroad to work our mines. Apparently the honorable member would consider a man who put money into Australian mines as an enemy to the country, but what we need is the investment of more capital in mining. I am surprised that honorable members should wish to put a duty of 4s. in the &#163;1 on the machinery that we most need in Australia to develop the mining industry. I shall vote for the lower duty. </para>

                    <para>.Thehonorable member for Melbourne Ports has spoken of the Great Cobar mine as an English company which never buys anything in Australia. That mine, however, was for many years an Australian property, and was developed by Australians. It is only about a year since the English company purchased it, so it is not correct to say that everything at the mine has been imported. Of course, much of the machinery is such as could not be made in Australia, because it is covered by patents. I do not hold a brief for the company, but I feel bound to correct a misstatement. </para>

                    <para>.- I opposed the reduction of the duty to 15 per cent. , but the proposed rate having been struck out, I accept the defeat as regards the higher duty, and am now prepared to vote for a duty of 20 per cent. Although mining is a very important industry in my district, I do not propose to speak at length on this subject, because I always tear in mind the value of our time, and the need in the country&#39;s interest for getting through the Tariff as quickly as possible. Therefore I make my remarks as short as I can. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to say a few words in reply to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie. The protectionist section of the Committee were generous enough to say that special machinery should go on the 15 per cent. list, but now honorable members opposite - some of whom came here claiming to be protectionists - want us to put all lines on that list. The sooner we put an end to that sort of thing the better, I think. Rather than vote for a duty of 15 per cent., I shall vote for these articles to be free. Either we ought to give protection, or we ought not to penalize the users of any machinery. A duty of 15 per cent. is not a protective, but a revenue duty. Some of us who voted for a duty of 15 per cent. did so by way of concession in regard to special machinery. But we are now dealing with machinery that can easily be made within the Commonwealth. I now admit that those of us who believe in protection made a mistake in the previous case in voting for 15 per cent., because it is evident that advantage is being taken of our generosity. I trust that the higher rate of duty will be agreed to. Personally, I should vote for duties of 35 and 30 per cent. if I had an opportunity. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Government are not going to endeavour to secure a duty of  20  per cent., as against imports from the United Kingdom. We should take into consideration the fact that rock drills were free under the old Tariff, and that this duty will apply to an industry, the raw materials of which cannot be admitted free but have to be sought for. I think that we have gone far enough to satisfy the desire of protectionists&#39; by imposing a duty of  20  per cent. against foreign countries, and  I  hope that the Committee will agree to a duty of not more than  15  per cent. as against imports from Great Britain.

                    <para>. - In this House, as in others, arrangements or compacts are often arrived at. Those who desired that rock drills should be subjected to a low rate of duty promised that if some of us would agree to their being dealt with in a separate paragraph they would support duties of  25  per cent. and  20  per cent. When we went to a division, however, they broke their compact, and therefore  I  think we have a right to insist on the highest rate of duty that we can secure. </para>

                        <para>- The Standing Orders provide that no honorable member must leave the chamber when a quorum has been called for. The honorable member for Indi left the chamber after attention was called to the absence of a quorum, as did the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who has since returned. The course that I should generally take in the circumstances would be to report the action of the honorable member for Indi to the  Speaker,  but probably the honorable member acted inadvertently. </para>

                        <para>. - I desired to have some re-arrangement of these items, and gave notice accordingly. The Treasurer, after consultation with his officers, has introduced the proposals in a way which I know is satisfying to those interested in New South Wales, Victoria., and South Australia. There is no justification for the charge that the officers have not endeavoured in every way to put these complex items on a sound footing. As the arrangement has the substantial approval of those interested in the manufacture and importation of the items, it is scarcely necessary for me to remind honorable members that many of the appliances are only in a state of development, considerably more so than is ordinary mining machinery. Day by day, the application of electricity to every branch of industry, and almost every department of life, is extending, and many of the appliances are very necessary in connexion with- the mining industry. I desire to move as a reasonable compromise that the duties be 20 per cent, and 15 per cent. I know there is a desire on the part of some honorable members for a lower duty, but &#91; think, my suggestion ought to meet the case. I wish to move - </para>

                        <para>- In dealing with this very important and complicated question of electrical machinery and appliances, we were at a considerable disadvantage by reason of the fact that very few witnesses appeared before us&#39; to give us any information. As a matter of fact, we heard no witnesses from Victoria. In Western Australia, however, evidence was tendered by the representative of the mining companies, who strongly protested against any duties being levied upon electrical machinery and appliances. The only evidence forthcoming in support of any change in the direction  of protective duties was that given by Mr. Barton, in Queensland. That gentleman stated that under the old Queensland Tariff, which imposed a duty of 25 per cent. upon electrical machinery, he had been able to manufacture motors, &#38;c, but that he was unable to compete successfully under the Commonwealth Tariff of 12&#189; per cent. </para>

                <para>The Tariff Commission arrived at certain conclusions in respect of this industry, one or two of which I propose to read. It is greatly to be regretted that a question of such magnitude - a question dealing with the advanced guard of scientific engineering, and exercising such a momentous influence upon our industrial system, has to be dealt with at this early hour of the morning, and in such a thin Committee. Among our conclusions we found that - electrical generators, motors, and fans, and other machinery and appliances have been made in Victoria and Queensland under 25 per cent. protective Tariffs, which were in operation at some period prior to Federation. </para>
                <para class="block">We also found that - there seems to be no reason why electrical generators and motors, probably up to a high capacity, and certainly up to 500 horse-power, should not in the future be made in Australia, provided the insulated conductors, and insulating materials required are admitted free. </para>

                        <para>- The Commission were of opinion that only two or three classes of electrical machinery could reasonably be expected to be made in Australia under existing conditions. We therefore recommended a duty of 25 per cent. on the machinery which I have named. The Government in its first proposals in regard to electrical machinery adopted our recommendation except as to rates, confining the higher duties to generators, motors up to the capacity of 500 horsepower, fans, and starting and regulating rheostats. But in the proposals now before the Committee they apply the duties to all electrical motive power and  machinery,  irrespective of horse-power. Motors of a capacity of over 500 horsepower, and other big electrical machinery, are not likely to be made in Australia for many years to come, and any duty imposed upon them will be merely revenue producing and oppressive to the industries that . have to use this machinery. But duties on small motors and generators may give a stimulus to local manufacturers. I am desirous of doing all I can to encourage the manufacture of electrical machinery in Australia; but I do not wish to go beyond what is fair and reasonable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> exSenator Higgs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Francis</inline> Clarke, and myself talked this matter over and came to the conclusion that the highest duty that should be imposed on the machinery I have mentioned was 25 per cent., and that bigger machinery should be dutiable at 12&#189; per cent. The proposals of the Government will do more harm than good, and will tend to make the Tariff objectionable. I do not wish to make enemies for the Tariff, my desire being to secure the greatest good for the greatest number, with the least amount of friction. In order to bring matters to an issue, and to restore the limitation originally recommended, I move - </para>

                        <para>- It has been pointed out by the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission that it is not reasonable to suppose that electric motors and generators over 500 horse-power will be manufactured in Australia for a considerable time. He has also shown that the Government have altered their first proposal in order to make dutiable, at 25 and 20 per cent. respectively, the whole of the electrical motor power which is used in the Commonwealth. Several interjections have been made which would imply that this class of machinery over 500 horse-power is used by only wealthy capitalists&#39; in mining operations. But let me point out that it is used in connexion with electric-lighting plants and tramway systems in large cities. To impose duties of 25 per cent. and 20 per cent. on such machinery, which cannot be made here, is simply to place a burden upon the great majority of the people who use electric tramways and electric light. I was expecting to hear a few words on this item from some of those who pretend to stand up for the rights of New South Wales, and, seeing that no one has risen to speak, not even on the Opposition side, I wish to bring before the Committee a letter which I have received from the Sydney Municipal Council. The letter reads as follows : - </para>

                    <para>Dear Sir,</para>
                    <para>I have the honour, by direction of the Sydney Municipal Council, to invite your attention to the fact that by reason of the new Customs Tariff the Council is likely to be involved in a very considerable outlay of money to cover the new duty on certain electric motors and other electric machinery and apparatus which are being imported from England for the Sydney Electric Light undertaking. </para>
                    <para>This machinery and motors cannot be reasonably manufactured in the Commonwealth, otherwise purchases would be made accordingly, and the Council is, therefore, obliged to import. </para>
                    <para>In these circumstances I am to represent <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> you, as one of the New South Wales members of the Federal Legislature, the great hardship under which the Council labours in this connexion, and to request you to kindly use every endeavour to have electric motors placed on the free list, . and the duties on electric machinery and apparatus largely reduced. </para>
                    <para>Thanking you in anticipation, </para>

                <para>As it is pointed out by the Council that the electrical machinery which they want for the lighting of Sydney cannot be reasonably made in Australia, I presume that it is over 500 horse-power. If it cannot be made here, then duties of 25 per cent.. and 20 per cent. should not be imposed. The honorable member for Hindmarsh, who is interrupting me, has spoken here time after time. </para>

I appeal to the Minister to accede to the request of that body, that electrical machinery which cannot reasonably be made in the Commonwealth should be placed upon the free list. The duty should at least be made as low as possible. It means a tax upon the working people of Sydney and suburbs, to whom the municipal council are endeavouring to supply cheap electric light in opposition to the Gas Company of Sydney - a huge monopoly which has been charging too high a price for a very long time. The Minister having, as I know, sympathy with the great working population of Sydney, will, I trust, see his way clear to assist the Sydney Council by allowing it to import its machinery at the lowest possible rate of duty </para>

                        <para>- Very reasonable progress has been made at this sitting, in my opinion. We have agreed to items- involving many thousands of pounds to the industrial community, and although they may &#39; not have been many in number they were of greater importance than perhaps ten times as many other items in the schedule. It is regrettable that we have not many electrical experts to advise us. The best advice &#39;that I have been able to obtain, leads me to say that we shall be perfectly safe in making the lower rate of duty operate on machinery over  .500  horsepower. The largest dynamo that I can see catalogued as made in Australia is one of  200  horse-power. I think we shall adopt a very fair standard in accepting the suggestion of the honorable member for Bendigo. Our requirements in . the way of electrical machinery are so limited that in all probability a dynamo of  500  horsepower will prove to be the maximum required. An increase of duty from  121  per cent, to  20  per cent, is as much protection as an industry that has reached the stage of development of the one we are considering can expect. from any Parliament. Recognising the impossibility of making a successful appeal to the Committee at this time. in the morning, when we ought to be in bed, I feel disposed to accept the suggestion of the Minister. </para>

                    <para>.The honorable and juvenile member for Cook, although* so newly a member of this House, has constituted himself lecturer-general to the Committee, and has admonished the representatives of New South Wales for not protesting against the proposed duty on electrical machinery and appliances. He also upbraided some honorable members for trying to drown his voice. But whatever noise was being made while he was speaking, came from his own corner; and if honorable members representing New South Wales have not hitherto spoken on this subject, it was simply because they were anxious to assist the Government in getting through the Tariff as quickly as possible, by trying to come to an understanding with the Government to secure a substantial reduction of duty I venture to say that, so far as this pan of the division is concerned, the Opposition cannot be accused of having unduly occupied the time of the Committee. The debate has been carried on either by Government supporters or their allies in the Ministerial corner, and if the Treasurer has any cause of complaint, he certainly has no complaint against the Opposition. Since both the honorable member for Cook and the honorable member for Barrier seem to think that the representatives of New South Wales on the Opposition benches should have made themselves heard more frequently, and at greater length than they have done, I propose, so far as I am concerned, to leave them no ground for complaint. The honorable member for Cook read a circular letter from the municipal council &#39; of Sydney which was sent to all &#39;the representatives of New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, simply because he first caught the Chairman&#39;s eye, although other members rose. I intend also to make some equally forcible observations regarding it. I should like to know whether the Minister of Trade and Customs received a copy of the circular letter from the municipal council of Sydney protesting against this duty, and pointing out the disabilities under which municipal bodies will labour if it be carried. Will the Minister agree to the reduction proposed by the honorable member for Bendigo? </para>

                        <para>- I remind the Minister of Trade and Customs that the responsible Minister in charge of the Tariff is not here, and has not definitely told the Committee what reductions he is willing to agree to respecting several of the articles included in the item, and that honorable members on- this side representing New, South Wales have been upbraided for not having put their views on this subject before the Committee. I have promised to remove all cause of complaint on that score, and I intend, to do so. I find, on referring to the Customs returns for 1906, that from the United Kingdom we imported this class of material to <inline font-style="italic">\he</inline> value of &#163;117,852, equal to 55.57 per cent, of the total imports. Our imports from Germany amounted in value to &#163;21,181 equal to 10.32 per cent. From Sweden, &#163;12,966 ; from the United States, &#163;52,426, equal to 24.72 per cent. ; and from all other countries, &#163;6,845 worth of these materials. The total value of these importations amounted to &#163;212,570. Turning to the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission in connexion with these matters, we find that it clearly proves that no duty we could impose -would enable the majority of these articles to be manufactured locally, unless the manufacture were preceded by a, very large increase in consumption, and also that the few articles that could be made here could only be produced at an excessive cost. At page 2240 of the Tariff Commission report, it will be found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crocker,</inline> of the Kalgoorlie Electric </para>

                <para>Power and Lighting. Company, gave this evidence - </para>
                <para>Practically none of the machinery and appliances used for producing and dealing with electricity are made in Australia. </para>
                <para class="block">That is the sworn evidence of an expert in this particular business. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crocker</inline> said in his&#34; evidence that Weymouth and Company, of Melbourne, did a little manufacturing, but added, &#34; We endeavoured to use one of their motors, but we did not find it working satisfactorily. Moreover, the price was &#163;67 9s. 3d., while the invoice price of . similar imported articles was &#163;17 10 s. lod.&#34; Evidently, therefore, there was a desire to give a preference to the local article, but the deal was found most unsatisfactory, and there was a great discrepancy between the two prices. The figures are so important that I should like to have a quorum present before proceeding. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline> So great a difference in price must have weight with municipal councils and similar bodies, who are responsible for the lighting of cites and &#39; answerable to the&#34; ratepayers for the proper and economical expenditure of the rates. If they bought articles at such vastly increased prices they would have to increase the rates. If they find that they cannot get appliances manufactured locally in a satisfactory manner or at a reasonable price they must, to conserve the interests of the ratepayers, go to the cheapest market. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crocker</inline> stated in his evidence that at such a price as he quoted it was impossible to use electrical machinery, for mining purposes. This is, therefore, a matter of the gravest concern to those engaged in mining enterprises. Now that the Treasurer is present, I shall be glad to hear what he proposes. </para>

Earlier in the sitting, when the honorable member for Cook rose, I rose at the same time, intending to speak on behalf of the honorable member for West Sydney. Then the honorable member for Cook pointed indignantly to the fact that no Sydney representative had taken up the claims of Sydney ! </para>

                        <para>- I was quite satisfied with the promise of the Treasurer; and  1  am pleased at the present attitude of the honorable gentleman. Electrical machinery is going to overtake other machinery ; and we know that in many mining districts, where wood is becoming scarce, water power is being used, wherever possible, to generate electricity. The honorable member for Bendigo has pointed out that in the item as it stands are articles which should not be included ; and I shall have much pleasure in supporting their elimination. I am hot prepared, however, to suggest a lower Tariff than 20 per cent. We should either have a protective Tariff or make the articles free; and 15 per cent. is simply a revenue duty. </para>

                    <para>. - The arrangement arrived at seems to be about the best possible under the circumstances; but if there were any hope of getting a still further reduction, I should be content to remain here much longer. Electricity is not the power of the future but the power of the present ; and in Tasmania there is a project on foot by which enormous electrical power is to be generated for lighting and motive-power purposes. Just when these enterprises are being attempted a paternal Government steps in and imposes taxation to the extent of 4s. in the&#163;1 on necessary articles, which cannot be made in Australia profitably for many years to come. Launceston, which is one of the most up-to-date cities in Australia, has a splendid system of electric lighting, and electric trams are being introduced; and similar progress is being made in South Australia. The proposed duty is wrong from the point of view of progress, and wrong even from a protectionist standpoint. I should strongly favour a lower duty ; but, believing that those holding the same views as myself have made the best bargain possible, I reluctantly fall in with the arrangement. </para>

                    <para>. - In agreeing to the arrangement by which a substantial reduction has been made, I regret that the Treasurer does not see his way to make a still further reduction, because these duties are altogether too high. A great deal of the machinery cannot, and will not, be made here; and any duty will be largely a revenue duty. I think that the Treasurer is acting unfairly in going beyond the recommendations of the A section of the Tariff Commission. However, as there appears to be no chance of securing anything more, I am forced to agree to what has been arranged. But I extremely regret that the Treasurer has not made more substantial concessions. </para>

                    <para>. - Electrical meters, that is machines for measuring and recording electric power, are made dutiable under item  180  at 5 per cent., if imported from foreign countries, but they may be imported free from Great Britain. I wish to have water and gas meters treated in the same way. Electrical works are partly municipal undertakings and partly private enterprises, and so, too, are gas-works, though there are more gas-works than electrical works under municipal control. The meters are not instruments which can be made in Australia. </para>

                        <para>-There was some confusion in regard to the matter, because they were taken out of item  164,  but were not inserted in the new item. Although we have dealt with manufactures of metals, the machines included in this item also come under that designation, and there are other items embracing manufactures of metal with which we have yet to deal. These meters are not made here. </para>

                        <para>- They are covered by patent rights, and are not made even in the large provincial towns of the United Kingdom, partly because powerful, exact and costly machinery is necessary for the striking out of the different parts. This machinery is very expensive, but is capable of turning out so much work when it is put into operation that it is not necessary, and would not pay, to have many plants. Consequently these parts are struck out in London, and sent to Edinburgh and other cities to be put together. There is no likelihood of their being made in Australia, because the number of meters required annually is not great, after the first supply has been placed in position. They should be put on the same footing as electrical meters. </para>

                    <para>. - I mentioned this matter when we were dealing with an earlier item, and was told that, because of a re-arrangement that was being made, it should be brought on later. I think that this is the proper place to make the amendment. I understand that the Metropolitan Gas Company of Melbourne puts together its own gas meters; but there are numbers of small gas works, owned largely by municipalities, that cannot do this. I understand that the parts of gas meters are covered by patent rights, so that they cannot be made here, and therefore it would be unfair to put a big revenue duty on them, which would have to be borne chiefly by the municipalities. </para>

                    <para>.Perhaps it would be as well to point out that the object of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports is to remove these articles from the 5 per cent. and free lists to the 20 per cent. list without any differentiation. By an artful manoeuvre he proposes to bring these lamps under a duty of 20 per cent. I for one resent such a proposition. It is trying the patience of members of the Opposition a little too far. These subterfuges, for they can be called nothing else, have been resorted to too often. </para>
