                            <para>- On my way northwards, about the date mentioned, the correspondent of the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> met me in Sydney. To his request for some statement regarding the Tariff, I raised the objection that there was nothing new at that - time. He then asked a question or two, adding that he thought even the shortest answers would be of great interest at that time to merchants and others in Great Britain concerned in the preferential question. Accordingly, I replied, practically in terms which differ only in trifling verbal construction from the summary which the honorable and learned member has- just read. The correspondent had mentioned at the commencement of the interview that he thought my replies would be of interest to merchants and preferentialists, but they were given by me as answers rather than messages to any particular class of persons. The statements are correctly given. I hope, if the debate advances far enough, to- have' an opportunity to touch upon this very question this evening. </para>

The consultation which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George proposed did not follow, so far as I remember, because I had already -had an interview with the head of the branch of his Department charged with the nominations.

In this case we appoint an Australian to proceed from Australia to Great Britain as an officer of the Government to carry out its directions and the policy of the country. In the other cases the appointments which are made in Great Britain are of a comparatively minor character from persons selected here, agents of the Government for special duties, which bring them in contact with certain Departments of the Federal Government, notably, for instance, the Department of Trade and Customs. </para>

                        <para>- In this morning's newspapers it is announced that the committee appointed to consider a design for a Commonwealth stamp have submitted a report in which it is stated that the first important recommendation is  fully concurred in by the Postmaster-General, and that it is to the effect that a representation of the King's head must appear on the new stamp. I wish to ask the Postmaster-General if it is his intention to afford to the Parliament an opportunity to decide  whether the stamp shall bear a representation of the King's head or something emblematic of Australia? </para>

A considerable interval has elapsed since a copy of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Sur.vey Act was forwarded to the Government of the State, and as it will be much more difficult to make a survey in the summer than in the cooler parts of the year, I would suggest to the honorable gentleman that he might with advantage urge upon the Government of South Australia that valuable time is being lost, and that the Parliament and the Government of the Commonwealth will be very glad if they will deal with the matter as promptly as possible. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">In submitting this motion, I desire to say that it will not be proceeded with for a few weeks, as it is desirable to allow the parties who are interested in the measure an opportunity to peruse it, and to make any representations that they may deem to be necessary. The Bill purports to embody a codification of the law. In the six States of the Commonwealth at the present time, the law relating to marine insurance is based upon what is known as the common law, and in order to ascertain what the common law is it is necessary to consult something like 2,000 decisions of the various Courts. In England, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir M.</inline> D. Chalmers, the "famous draftsman, who drafted the Bills of Exchange Act, codified the law in respect of marine insurance, after having spent a considerable time upon it. Between 1894 and 1906 the measure which he drafted came before the Imperial Parliament several times, and was carefully considered by expert Committees. Last year - after it had undergone several modifications - it became the law of Great Britain. It is proposed to adapt that law to the conditions of Australia, and, accordingly, we desire to afford those who are interested in the measure every opportunity to see how far the provisions of the British Act are applicable. My advice is that the Bill is suitable to Australian conditions, but, inasmuch as it relates to a matter which concerns particular interests, it is highly desirable that those who will be affected by it should have an opportunity of becoming familiar with its provisions before its second reading is carried. I desire to have the measure circulated at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                        <para>.- Upon this item I desire to test the feeling of the Committee on the general question of whether or not any preference should be extended to the Mother Country. I do not intend to labour the matter, as upon two previous occasions I have advanced reasons for the excision of the second column of this Tariff. These reasons really amount to this : that I believe the initiation of a policy of preference will make against, rather than for, the integrity of the Empire. I therefore desire to move - </para>

                    <para>SirWILLIAM LYNE (Hume)- Treasurer - [3.28]. - In dealing with this matter I do not propose to occupy the time of the Committee at any length. From events which have occurred during the past two or three years - and particularly during the past six or twelve months - the desire of the Government in. reference to the extension of a preference as between Australia and Great Britain must be very clear to honorable members. If they desire to obtain further information upon that question, they need only read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the debate which took place in this Chamber a little more than two years ago, and also the report of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister and myself dealt with this matter so far as Australia was concerned. We had no authority to deal with - it from any other stand-point. In the official report of the debates of the Conference, honorable members will find set out in detail the position which the Government have taken up regarding this question, and they will also discover that the proposals which were there foreshadowed have been honestly embodied in this Tariff. I intend to quote from a few English journals, because, I regret to say, that owing to the formation of the cable syndicate, the public of Australia obtain only news which has been censored by its representative in London. </para>

In some of the newspapers which I have had an opportunity to read, extracts from which I shall quote in the course of my speech, it. is shown that what has been represented in Australia through the cables published in the newspapers, to the effect that Great Britain is against a policy of preference is not warranted - that what has been published here is not a true interpretation of British feeling to-day. </para>

                                <para>- I do not desire to make a speech which will lead to almost interminable debate, and that is why I have referred honorable members to what took place when the Prime Minister and myself were in Great Britain. We then stated that this question would be settled, and that we could settle it readily enough when we were dealing -with the Tariff. There is, of course, a great' temptation to make a lengthy speech, but I shall not embrace the present opportunity to do so. It had been intended. I think, to commence a debate upon the subject on Thursday, but the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Angas today affords a better opportunity than we should then have had, because, under the circumstances which then prevailed, the question might have been mixed up with matters arising in connexion with the general tariff. I think the honorable member's amendment now before the Committee will have the effect! of shortening the debate. It has been said by honorable members opposite, and by other people outside, that the preference proposals of the Government are made by way of bargaining. Nothing of the kind is the case. There is no bargain of any sort. </para>

                                <para>- And I should . like to see them reciprocated now. I said the same in Great Britain, where my  argu-.ment  went to show that the policy of preference would do a great deal of good in the development of our agricultural resources in Australia, and' also in cementing all parts of the Empire together. But to say so much was not to advocate this policy by way of bargaining. The Government, as I shall show by references to the Prime Minister's speeches, said at the Imperial Conference that a policy of preference would be proposed, but that nothing in the nature of a bargain would be put forward. There is no understanding, there is no  bargain  of any kind as between Great Britain and Australia. Therefore the statement that there has been any bargaining is absolutely without foundation. </para>

                        <para class="block">The question was asked last week - " Upon what basis is this proposal made ? ' " The basis is to take the large foreign importations as shown by the figures in the .papers circulated in connexion with the Tariff, and to give a preference in respect of those importations in favour of Great Britain. That is the main basis. I shall presently quote some figures to show to what extent it has been carried out. The principle upon which the Government has acted has been to have regard to the immense foreign trade which is undermining British importations to Australia to-day, and leading to an increased foreign trade. </para>

                                <para>- Where there is a large importation from foreign countries, part of which, at any rate, we think could be transferred to Great Britain, our principle is to endeavour to so divert that trade or a portion of it. The Government wish to see a change from foreign trade to British trade. It must not be thought for a single moment that anything which I say is to be interpreted to mean that we do not intend to protect our own industries. It would be a most absurd thing to so lower our Tariff as to lead to an increased importation from  the 'Mother Country of goods which we ourselves can manufacture. I say that we, in a young country like this, have to protect our own industries, or we shall not be doing justice to Australia; and one of the great objects of this new Tariff is to do justice to Australian manufacturers and producers of raw material - to give them increased opportunities of converting that raw material into manufactured goods. But our object is at the same time so to arrange the Tariff as to secure that a greater portion of the large importations from foreign countries shall be transferred and enter Australia through British channels. , Let us have these goods, as far as possible, brought from Great Britain. To secure that will be to do an immense amount of good to British trade, and to British manufacturers, while at the same time conserving to a very great extent our trade within the British Empire. </para>

Then, again, the United States imposes a duty on- every commodity we export, but, nevertheless, that country will accept what raw material she requires, while at the same time most effectively protecting her own industries. Under the circumstances, the argument about our making enemies of great nations is not worth a moment's consideration. </para>

But they were unable to answer <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne's statement that, when the duty of is. a quarter was imposed in Great Britain oh imported corn in 1902, the price fell off slightly while it rose when the duty was taken off..... </para>

                            <para>So, in regard to the Australian Tariff, of which particulars had just come to hand when we went to press with our issue of 14th August, we pointed out that there was " assuredly no intention to put British manufacturers on a level with local producers, but to keep them  in  front of their foreign competitors"-  </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para>That is the true position -  though we maintained that the preference given was not a "sham," as some politicians would have us believe. Further study of the Tariff - of which we published a fortnight ago all the details that are <inline font-style="italic">even</inline> yet available  in  this country - does not incline us to qualify our first expression of opinion. Even the <inline font-style="italic">Westminster Gazette</inline> acknowledges that " <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne and his school have been absolutely frank about their intentions since the question of preference was started." They; have never made any secret of the fact that their first object was the fostering of their home manufactures, and that nothing would be done for the Mother Country which interfered with it. If, therefore, they think, as they undoubtedly do, that the proper way to. encourage and aid home industries is to impose a high Tariff on competing imports, how can. we blame them if their policy is shaped in&gt; accordance with their beliefs? And since something like two-thirds of the Australian over-sea commerce is with the United Kingdom, how could they carry out their policy unless they protected their own manufacturers against the competition of British firms, since they alone had so large a share of the trade? </para>
                        <para class="block">That is the position which the Government have always taken up. Our object is to. restrict foreign competition with our own. manufactures, and, as far as possible, transfer the existing foreign trade to GreatBritain. </para>

                            <para>It pleases free-traders to sneer at the preference given ; to depreciate its importance, and to regard it as Australia's " last word " on the subject. A more mistaken view can hardly be conceived. Let all who desire to discuss the question be perfectly candid and endeavour to realize things as they are. It would not have been surprising if after the Colonial Conference there had been no preference; but Australia has given one without bargaining," and on the basis of present conditions. </para>

They have told us that the fostering of their home manufactures was their first object, and that nothing would be done for the Mother Country which interfered with it. . . But they are free to alter their Tariff as they think  fit, and they have been perfectly frank with us. It is therefore useless and unjust to complain of deception on their part. </para>

                        <para class="block">These are a few paragraphs which I have selected from a number recently sent to me from Great Britain. They indicate that there is on the part of a large section of the people of Great Britain a feeling that we are carrying out our promise, and there has been no deception. Every one clearly understood what we proposed to do. They recognise that although we failed in our efforts to induce the British Government to enter into a reciprocal agreement, we did not decline for that reason to grant any (preference to the old country. We are granting her a preference, asking for nothing in return, and are content to wait until she is prepared to reciprocate, if that time should ever come. It is all .very well to urge that we have attempted to interfere with the free-trade policy of Great Britain. I do not intend to discuss that question, except in passing to inquire why our Australian wines could not be admitted duty free into the United Kingdom without raising the price of bread and foodstuffs generally.' The wine industry in Australia is a very large one, but our wines to a large extent are purchased by French people, carried to France, and after being blended, there with much lighter wines, a large proportion of them probably find 'their way into Great Britain. It would be very much better if we were in .a position to secure the direct introduction of our wines free or nearly free into Great Britain. </para>

The total value of foreign imports in respect of which we have granted a preference is ^8,115,294, and the percentage of foreign imports on which a preference is given to the total foreign imports is 71.

                        <para>The preference concessions will, on the basis of our present imports, represent ^1,250,000, or nÂ£ per cent. That is to say,  that  amount  represents  the difference in duty between the general Tariff and the preference Tariff; but as it is expected that the imports from Great Britain will increase in consequence of these preference proposals, it will not be improper to estimate that the concession will amount to, say, ^1,500,000, or 13^ per cent. </para>

In the last table I read I included a number of items with a percentage preference of 100 per cent. If. the honorable member will go through the figures when they are printed, I shall be glad to hear every criticism that he has to offer upon them, because I have instructed the officers to be exceptionally careful in this matter, and to give me all the particulars, so that I might lay them before the Committee. My main object was to get from independent individuals who understand this question thoroughly - and no one understands the preference proposals better than does the Comptroller-General of Customs, under, whose direction these figures were prepared by one of his officers - a true comparison of the percentages of preference offered by Canada and Australia, showing as a whole the advantage that we propose to give to Great Britain. I have given that information to honorable members, and I shall be very glad to hear what holes they can pick in it. </para>

                                <para>- I ask the honorable member to look at the figures carefully, and he will find there are no contradictions. The other evening certain honorable members said that I was giving away the preference in connexion with biscuits, and I think also in connexion with blue. The preference proposed in connexion with those items amounts practically to nothing. Neither the Prime Minister nor myself attach much importance to the preference proposed in connexion with small items. What we are concerned about are the proposals in connexion with the main items which give a considerable and important preference to Great Britain. </para>

                                <para>- Those to which I referred as representing large foreign importations. I am not to blame if the honorable member could not follow them. If the debate on preference is not concluded to-night, honorable members will have an opportunity to see the figures to which I have referred in print. I hope they will go through the various calculations  carefully,  to see how they have been worked out by the officers of the Department, when I have no doubt they will find that the figures I have quoted are correct. I wish particularly to impress  upon honorable members that in what I am saying I believe I am giving expression to the very strong feelings entertained by the Prime Minister in regard' to this matter. It will be admitted that the honorable gentleman would be placed in a very unenviable position were the Committee, to refuse to grant the preference submitted after he had given his word that preference to Great Britain would be proposed. The newspaper extracts I have made show that some of the press writers understand exactly what was said, and have correctly interpreted what was stated by the Prime Minister. The Government have brought down proposals which will give a substantial preference to British manufacturers in respect of the main items affected, representing at the present time large importations from foreign countries. We desire that a certain proportion of those articles should be manufactured by ourselves, and that the balance should be imported from Great Britain rather than from foreign countries. I have no doubt that a considerable  importa-tion  of these articles will continue to be  made from foreign countries, but at the same time I believe that a substantial proportion of them will, under the Government proposals, be imported in future from Great Britain. If we carry, not a half-and-half, but a truly protectionist Tariff, as the country intended, British manufacturers will obtain a share of our present trade with foreign countries, whilst there will still be ample room for the local manufacture and production of many of the articles now imported from foreign countries. Australia is a continent nearly equal in area to the United States, and yet in spite of its great possibilities and mineral wealth, we can. never expect that it will be populated as we desire, unless we establish our own manufactures for the production of articles which we are at present importing from foreign countries. Whilst we desire that our own kith and kin in Great Britain should supply us with what we are unable to manufacture and* produce locally, we hope under this Tariff to induce our own people to do a great deal more- than they are now doing to supply Australian requirements in the manufacture of the raw materials we produce. That should be the object of every Australian. Whatever he may call himself, I do not call any man an Australian who encourages the importation of articles which are the production of the cheap labour of the Continent of Europe, to the detriment of our own people. That very thing is being done bv some members of the Committee who still call themselves protectionists. If we do nothing else we should at least stand by Australia and the development of Australian industries - the object being that this may be made a self-contained country, When Federation was established, Victoria, by reason of the policy she had adopted, was the only self-contained State in the Union, whilst the State that was least self-contained was New South Wales, the wealthiest State in the Union. </para>

                                <para>- The State that was borrowing more money, and paying bigger interest for it than other States. Fortunately, we have not been compelled to borrow money since the establishment of Federation. Free-trade representatives of New South Wales will very soon find that the old Tariff has done good for that State, and that if the hew Tariff is passed' in the form the Government desire, manufactures and employment will increase to a greater extent in New South Wales than in any other State, because she possesses such immense latent wealth. They will also find that Australia will become, I hope during my lifetime, a self-contained country of which we can all be proud. </para>

                            <para>. - The Tariff, as amended, contains a duty of 2d. per lb. under the general Tariff, and a similar duty is imposed on goods from the United Kingdom. I desire to move the excision of the second duty. The duty on candles would then be 2d. all round. We must come to some understanding as to what the Ministry will, do as a result of the voting on the amendment. What I suggest is that we should test the question whether there should 1 be any preference by a vote for or against my amendment. If, however, the duty is left in, the same object will be accomplished, as there will be no preference given, seeing that the duty proposed will be the same under the general Tariff as under the special Tariff. But if it is struck out, the Ministry can take that as an intimation from the Committee that there is to be no preference given at all, and can re-construct the Tariff on that understanding. </para>

                                <para>- The duty proposed in the two columns is now the same. The Treasurer can, if he pleases, propose a reduction in the duty in one column, in order to make it different. An amendment might be moved reducing the duty on imports from the United Kingdom to iÂ£d. per Jb. That will test the feeling of the Committee as to whether preference should or should not be granted. </para>

                                <para>- I do not suggest that there has been any verbal communication between the Minister and the honorable member ; but the statements made by the Minister to the Committee were equivalent to asking him to move the amendment. A number of honorable members who are opposed to preference do not wish to vote for any reduction, while an honorable member like the honorable member for Parramatta, who,, no doubt, would like to see candles admitted as cheaply as possible, and yet is in favour of giving preference to the United Kingdom, would be placed in a difficulty, because he would either have to vote for a higher duty, or against preference. I do not believe in preference without reciprocity, but I do not wish other honorable members to be put in a position similar to that which I have occupied on two previous divisions. The Minister distinctly promised that only amendments of the general Tariff would be proposed until the question of preference had been dealt with. </para>

If the proposal of the honorable member for Angas were adopted, we should have a straight-out division on the question of preference.

                                <para>- In any case, it seems to me most inconvenient. The honorable member for Angas, who is opposed to preference, will be called upon- to vote for the rate of i|d. per lb. In putting before the Committee a proposition in regard to which we are nearly all in agreement, altogether irrespective pf the merits of preference,  the opinion of the Committee on the subject of preference is not properly tested. I submit that the proposal of the honorable member for Angas is the only way of testing the question. If the Ministry desire to help us, there might be an understanding that a vote on the amendment is not to be taken as fixing the duty. </para>

                            <para>.- I was surprised by the remarks of the honorable member for Corio. It was distinctly stated on  Friday  that the two Tariffs should be considered separately, so that a clear vote might be taken on the question of preference. The Minister is, therefore, carrying out his promise. It was I who suggested to the honorable member for Cowper that he should move his amendment, but he allowed it to stand over until today, so that there might be a clear vote on the question of preference. It seems to me that this is the easiest way of obtaining a vote on the subject. If the honorable member for Angas and those who are opposed to preference vote against the amendment of the honorable member for Cowper, the opinion of the Committee on the question of preference will  be  elicited. </para>

                                <para>- I suggest that if the amendment of the honorable member for Cowper be withdrawn, and an amendment by the honorable member for Angas, to omit the words " two pence," be carried, it would create a blank, when, unless the word "free" were inserted, the duty would still be 2d., as it is now. Any honorable member would be at liberty to move that the blank be filled by the insertion of the figures "  1Â½d.  " or " Â£d." </para>

                            <para>.- Mav I suggest to the Committee that a test vote on the question of preference could be taken on a proposition to omit from the amendment the words "and on and after." Those who hold that there should be no preference could vote against the insertion of the words. If the  anti-preferentialists  were in a majority, they could thus destroy the preference. That, it seems to me, is the only way to separate the question of preference from the question of figures. We have* often taken a test vote on the first word of an amendment. </para>

                            <para>. -The amendment suggested by the leader of the Opposition is open to a slight objection. We have to remember that the imports from England are collected at the lower rates, and that if the question of preference be tested in that way, or in accordance with my suggestion, the Government must still co-operate, either by promising not to sue those who have imported at the lower rates for the difference, or by putting in words to the effect that, notwithstanding the alteration, goods imported before the abolition of preference at the lower rate are not to be charged the extra duty. That is the reason why I ask the Government to cooperate with me. Any intelligent Government would get the Committee out of its  present difficulty by making the necessary provision afterwards. If I were to move to strike out the heading of the column, that would raise the whole question, but, as the  Chairman  has stated, we have already passed some figures under that heading, and it would be inconvenient to go back now and deal with the heading. <inline font-style="italic">M</inline> we strike out the second figure there will be no preference given, and the Government can provide subsequently that, notwithstanding that goods were imported at the lower rates, no further duty will be charged. </para>

                                <para>- Those who were against the grant of preference would vote for the omission of the words " and on and after." If they were defeated in the division those words would remain, and we could still deal with the rate of duty. Otherwise I and others would be placed in an awkward position. I do not intend to move, if I can help it, against a reduction of the duty. The test vote ought to be taken in such a way as to preclude the possibility of any honorable members being charged afterwards with having voted against a reduction of the duty. If a test division were taken in the way I have suggested no complication could arise in dealing with the item afterwards, because it would leave the Committee with a free hand as regards the rate of the duty. </para>

                            <para>. - I desire to say that it is scarcely fair to attack me for attempting, to do other than to carry out the arrangement which was made the other evening. It was then clearly understood that the honorable member for Cowper intended to test this question by moving a reduction in the duty proposed to be levied upon, candles imported from the United Kingdom. The honorable member for Angas wished to eliminate the preference altogether, but I objected to that suggestion at the time and it was not' persevered with. What I then said was that I was quite prepared to give the Committee an opportunity to vote upon this question to-night. I do not care in what direction the proposal is made so long as it does not result in any complication of the issue. Why I raised the question in the first instance was that if the original proposal of the honorable member for Angas had been submitted in the form in which such proposals are usually submitted, the proposed preference would, in any case, have been eliminated. I do not withdraw, from the position which I took up the other evening. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Cowper has moved to reduce the duty upon candles imported from the United! Kingdom by Jd. per lb., and upon his proposal the honorable member for Angas has moved the omission of the words " and on and after.'-' I take it that if those words are excised the effect will be to destroy the preference proposed to be granted to the United Kingdom right through the schedule. It will probably destroy the Government too. </para>

                            <para>.- I think that fewer references to possibilities as the result of the vote of the Committee would be  more  desirable in the interests of that independence which every Parliament ought to have in discharging its public duties. If Ministers, prematurely - on the first breath of opposition - throw such decisive statements across the table, in many cases they practically close the debate be- fore it has begun. I think that such expressions should be avoided in a House which is supposed to be composed of independent, representatives of the people. I am very glad that upon the present occasion we may hope to have the satisfaction of hearing a statement from the Prime Minister upon this important question. I propose therefore to deal with it much more fully* than I should have done under other circumstances. The Treasurer concluded his remarks with a very patriotic peroration, in which he aspired to the time when Australia will be a self-contained country. It is a noble ambition, but an impossible one. There is no country in the world which has ever been, or which ever, can be, self-contained.. If we settled fifty persons in the centre of .the most abundant natural resources, with every product capable of satisfying their pleasures, or tastes, or industrial dispositions, there would still remain something wanting without which the whole of their wealth would lead not to happiness but to misery - I refer to intercourse with other intelligent human beings in other countries. Take the case of the United States, with their marvellous natural resources, marvellous population, and with the most rigid protective policy the world has ever seen. If honorable members study the statistics of that country, they will find that in spite of their enormous export trade they have an enormous import trade, which is valued at several hundred millions sterling, or more than $1,000,000,000 dollars annually. These sentiments are often unsound. Man was not created to live in isolation from his fellow man in different parts of the world. One would think that the human being in a state of isolation, who had everything that he could desire, would reach the highest pitch of happiness and wealth. But he would not. He would be the most melancholy and miserable individual in the world unless he had the freest intercourse with his fellow man. We ought to feel deeply impressed by the eloquent aspirations of the leading protectionists in Australia for a closer commercial intercourse with the greatest freetrade country in the world. It is one of the most striking developments of Australian protection that we find the eloquence of its leading advocates devoted to an expression of the most profound desire to cultivate closer commercial relations with the greatest free-trade nation in the world, which happens to be the mother country. How can there be closer commercial intercourse without an increase in the exchange of commodities between the two countries? Would it be commercial intercourse to exchange sovereigns for goods - for Great Britain to send out her millions of pounds in coin or bullion each year in exchange for Australian meat or wheat ? Would that be commercial exchange ? No ! The expression conveys the idea of the exchange of commodities which are produced in the respective countries. </para>

                                <para>- It is a medium of ex- ' change, but it is not a medium of interchange. There is a great difference between the two expressions. But I wish to direct the attention of the Committee, first, to the fact that the perorations of the greatest protectionists in Australia are now being devoted to a development of commercial interchange between the great markets and the great manufacturing powers of the Mother 'Country and the great markets and producing centres of Australia. Apart from the patriotic consideration, this fact represents a striking development in the political attitude of leading protectionists. The theory of protection itself is absolutely opposed to any such arrangement. The theory upon which Australian: protection has been founded always has been that there are industries in Australia which in their period of infancy must be protected from the pressure of outside competition on the part of older nations in a more advanced industrial condition. Well, that policy is entirely opposed to the policy of increasing the hold of British manufactures upon the markets of Australia. The two policies do not harmonise. They are absolutely opposed one to the other. The first question that I want to ask on this Tariff is - Are those duties in the second schedule - which form the offer of a preference to the Mother Country - supposed to be a sufficient protection for Australian industries, or not ? If they are not a sufficient protection for Australian industries, the Ministry are not faithful to the mandate which,  according to their own statement, they received from the people. We are told - and I have never denied it - that the result of the general election has shown a distinct desire on the part of the people for a protectionist policy. Did that mean a sufficient protection or an insufficient protection? Was it a verdict for real protection or not? Does this Tariff - in the second column - represent the views of the Government as to rates of duties which are sufficient for Australian industries? If they are sufficient for Australian industries, there is no real preference given. If they are not sufficient for Australian industries, there is a preference given at the expense of the main principle of the Administration and of honorable members opposite. It is impossible to reconcile those two things. </para>

                                <para>- I want first to start with a broad view of the tests which we ought to apply in this discussion. That is the dilemma which the Government are in - either these duties against the Mother Country are sufficient to protect Australia or they are not. If they are sufficient to protect Australia, the suggested preference is a sham. If they are not sufficient to protect Australia, the protectionist policy of the Administration is a sham. That is the issue which I put. My honorable friend the member for Wimmera puts a very fair question to me. He asks whether something cannot be done which would change the current of foreign trade. Now, that is an aspect of the matter which is well worthy of consideration. But I want first to take the broad aspect of the policy of British preference, and then deal with it in detail. I shall not overlook the honorable member's question, I hope. But let us endeavour to know where we are, and what this thing means. Take the rates in the second column. If they have safeguarded Australian manufacturers from British competition,, then I say the preference is a sham to that extent. </para>

                                <para>- I aim asking questions; I am not assuming anything. It is .impossible for me to say whether the rates of duty will or will not shut out importations. Perhaps the Government, as the authors of the Tariff, could say whether they think it will or will not have that effect. But if the duties are sufficient to shut out foreign and British competition in manufactures, there is nothing in them from a preference point of view. If they are insufficient to shut out British competition, there is a good deal in them that is hostile to the main principle of this Tariff. That is the dilemma which I put to the Government. I admit at once that there is a great deal to be said apart altogether from that' dilemma and on the point suggested by the honorable member for Wimmera. I wish to say parenthetically that, much as I differ from the views of the Prime Minister, so far as ability and force are concerned he was a perfectly worthy representative of Australia at the Conference. So that I hope it will be understood that my criticisms have no personal bearing. The impression which the Prime Minister made upon the people of the Mother Country was-evidently a very strong one. To us in Australia there was the difficulty of quite grasping the change which had come over the Prime Minister in his ardour to encourage closer commercial intercourse with Great Britain. If it were a mere desire, under cover of a cloud of beautiful words, to entice the people of the Mother Country into a policy which would simply yield a large return for Australia, that would be an attempt of which I am sure no one would feel the slightest approval. There must be a serious purpose beneath this policy. But while the Treasurer pictured Australia as a country which is to be peopled by means of a protectionist policy, the Prime Minister in his brilliant visions pictured Australia as peopled owing to the consumption of Australian wheat by the millions of the people of the Mother Country. The Prime Minister over and over again has pointed out that if there were a preference to wheat grown in countries like Australia and Canada, such an enormous impetus would be given to our farming enterprise that Australia would indeed enter upon a career of unexampled industry and prosperity. These pictures can scarcely be made to hang together. The one picture1 suggests that a Tariff wall will enable Australia to be peopled and developed,' while the other picture suggests a free interchange between the manufacturers of England and the primary producers of Australia. In what other way can we encourage British industry except by) opening  our doors to the manufactures of the Mother Country? If you talk to the people of England of opening the door to their wheat or their turnips they will laugh at you.. You can offer a trading inducement to the people of England only by opening your doors to the enterprise of their manufacturers. If you are prepared to sacrifice your manufacturers for- the benefit of your farmers, say so. Because if this is to be an honest bargain, it is not something for nothing. It is something for something. It must mean that or it is a s'ham. Well, this something for something must mean more than an interference with' the current of foreign trade. At the present moment the Mother Country, in spite of your protective Tariff and your barriers, sends more than Â£26,000.000 worth of goods per annum into Australia. The whole of the foreign trade of the world with Australia is only about one half of that, and one half of that trade would be impossible to the Mother Country if you opened your ports to-morrow, because it consists of articles which could not be produced in that country. In other words, one-half of your foreign trade is a trade which you could not divert in that direction. Let me just show by reference to two or three items only the magnificent hold which this "decaying" Mother Country has in the markets of Australia. Having no preference here, having to compete on equal terms with ' the mighty enterprise of an awakened Germany and of the magnificent United States on this impartial battle ground, what is the position of the Mother Country ? In respect to three items - piece goods, cotton and linen, woollens, and iron plates, corrugated and galvanized- products to the value of Â£6,000,000 sterling a year come into Australia from the Mother Country. How much from all the other countries in the world? Only Â£298,000 from France, Germany, and the United States - from- the cheap white and coloured labour of the world, to whom our market had been as free as it was to the people of the Mother Country. What sort of _ substantial advantage would Great Britain ' reap if we wiped out that Â£298,000 of foreign trade altogether? It is not by wiping out the 'foreign trade that we can give Great Britain a substantial advantage ; that must be done by wiping out our Australian manufactures. </para>

                                <para>- No; I am only talking ot a policy, and not expressing any personal wishes. But we owe to the people of the Mother Country straight plain talk. We are told that the Treasurer, at the Conference, deplored the fact that the lifeblood of England was being sucked out of her bf foreign trade. I have been looking at Australian figures in regard to this neutral battle-ground. I find that, during the four years from 1902 to 1906, the increase of imports from the Mother Country was Â£2,700,000 worth, as against an increase of under Â£200,000 worth from France, Germany, and the United States combined, there being a positive decrease in the case of France and the. United States. Whether protectionists or free-traders, we are glad to see, written in the undeniable figures of our own trade statistics, the marvellous energy and success which still remain with the industries of the Mother Country. Those results have not been won by favoritism or preferential trade. The Treasurer, at the Imperial Conference, not only deplored the sucking of the life-blood out of the Mother Country, but said that, in spite of his having a father and a grandfather from the old land, something more was wanted - that some further link was required. What was it? The missing link he longed for was a closer unity of commerce between the Mother Country and the rest of the Empire. What a strange utterance from this rabid protectionist Treasurer ! </para>

                                <para>- And I heartily applaud that noble sentiment. But we cannot have much closer commerce with the manufacturing millions of England, without impinging on the developing industries of protected Australia; we cannot have a displacement in favour of one force, without injuriously affecting another force. The Prime Minister at the Conference, in a burst of eloquence which, happily, never costs him an effort, made this statement - </para>

                        <para class="block">Let me stop there. In 1902, there was a resolution in favour of substantial preference ; and, in April and May of this year, the Imperial Conference, after debate, and in spite of the attitude of the British Government, deliberately re-affirmed the substantial preference of 1902. Consequently, the Commonwealth Government stands pledged in honour to a substantial preference - not only a preference, but a substantial preference - an unconditional, substantial preference without any bargaining for something in return. The Government stand pledged twice over to an unconditional substantial preference. Can we be surprised at the attitude of the British Government, although our Prime Minister, with his great eloquence and ability, brought all his genius to bear on their position? Was there ever a. more extraordinary, expedition outside the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Don Quixote</inline> than that in which the Prime Minister engaged when he went to the Mother Country to upset a free-trade policy which had just been affirmed by millions of the electors of Great Britain, and which, in the House of Commons, had been further affirmed by about 500 votes to 98? Was there ever anything more, I shall not say ridiculous, but anything more chivalrous in the region of practical politics, than for a practical statesman to go to the people and Ministers of the Mother Country, with the enormous mass of parliamentary support behind them, and expect, by the charm of Australian eloquence, to melt  away  those solid battlements behind which millions of the people stood - to charm away the solemn faith of the British Government, and destroy, with a breath, the policy on which, for good or evil, the destinies of the Mother Country solidly rest to-day ? It was one of the most extraordinary positions. Can we be surprised that the British" Government had to say " no " ? What would our Prime Minister have thought had the British Ministry said " yes " ? How unfair, as the Treasurer practically did, to put the Ministers of the old country in a false position, as if they were ungracious and offensive in their attitude of negation. What would have been said if we had had an overwhelming protectionist vote at our elections, affirming the policy of protection, and British statesmen had come here, and at a Conference board, thundered with all. their eloquence, asking the Ministers of Australia to abandon their protectionist policy as a fetish - as a thing which had no real sense or substance in it? What would have been said of such British Ministers? What would our newspapers have said of them? I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> made one of the manliest expositions pf the question I have ever seen in a heated controversy. </para>

You could not do it. It is a negation of protection. Obviously the thing itself is contradictory. I will not go into the question whether the British manufacturer will remain the most dangerous. I think at this moment he still is, at any rate, very dangerous, and you cannot have him in. You know you cannot without abandoning  protection </para>

I think it is - a straightforward recognition of the view of protectionists. If the protectionists say to the Mother Country, " We are going to give up our policy of shutting you out; Ave see you can do us a great deal of good if we cripple our manufactures for the benefit of our farmers," they will make the only substantial offer that can be made. Listen to the words of General Botha, who was one of the bitterest, although one of the bravest and  straightest,  enemies the British race ever had. Sitting at the Conference table; he made a very short speech, from which I shall  quote  a few words. He said - </para>

The position that we take in the Transvaal now that we have responsible government, is that the Mother Country ought to leave us alone as much as possible to regulate our own affairs, and, therefore, it is all the more difficult for me to come here and interfere with matters concerning the Mother Country. So far -as I can judge it appears to me that the British people made their voices and opinion heard on this matter during the last general election in England.  . . Although no preference is given by the Mother Country to the Transvaal, the bond between the Transvaal and the- Mother Country will not thereby be weakened. That is all i have to say. </para>

We respect her decisions, and whether she gives us this or that or refrains from doing so, our attachment to her will not be weakened." The unconditional preference which the Commonwealth Ministers propose to give is one to which, if substantial, no human being ought, I think,' to object. I look upon the idea of giving an unconditional preference to the Mother Country as a generous one, and to the extent to which the Ministry fight for it, I am not one to criticise them. If they carry out their pledge of a substantial preferential treatment, I shall be the first to applaud their efforts. It is a generous policy, and, having regard to the facts of the case, one which ought to commend itself. It is all tha more striking, coming as it does from public men who are protectionists ; since it is much easier for free-traders to support preferential trade, as incidentally reducing, or seeming to reduce, the height of protectionist duties. I have no word of criticism to offer against the conduct of a Ministry in standing up as the champions .of substantial preference; but the question is: Have Ministers fulfilled their promise? What would have been the shock to that august assemblage in London if, after the impassioned speech delivered by the Prime Minister of Australia, an anticipatory draft of the Tariff now before us had been laid on the table of the Conference? What would have been the shock of astonishment that would have run  through the British Isles if the people had heard then of what was to be done by. those who were clamouring for the imposition of taxes on the very bread and meat of struggling millions - under a glorious programme of lightening the burdens of competition and opening the bright gates of Australia to the depressed, 'oppressed, and decaying British manufacturers? What would have been said if, immediately after the Prime Minister's speech at the Conference, the people of Great Britain had been told that on the main lines of British industry the Australian duties, in some cases, were to be doubled? When the oratory of the Prime Minister was gushing so freely there was a duty of 15 per cent, on woollen piece goods. .We have now a duty of 30 per cent, against such imports from the Mother Country. The duty has been doubled. The duty on machinery was, in. respect to a number of lines, <inline font-style="italic">i2h</inline> per cent. ; it is now. 20 and 25 per cent. I am not quite sure whether the duty on cotton and linen piece good's has been varied. If I remember rightly, it was 5 per cent, under the old Tariff, and that duty remains as against British imports, whilst those from foreign countries are dutiable at 10 per cent. But let us look for a moment at the main lines of British export. Cotton manufactures, Â£100,000,000 ; woollen manufactures, Â£32,000,000; linen, jute, and apparel, Â£19,000,000. I think that we now have duties ranging from 25 to 40 per cent, on apparel imported from the Mother Country. </para>

                                <para>- This is a first instalment; there is more to follow. The Prime Minister, through a newspaper reporter, sent a cablegram to the merchants of Great Britain, saying " There is more to come.lr Did he mean another 20 per cent, on apparel - another message of brotherly love? The British export of metals, including new ships, are of the value of Â£40,0001,000, and the exports of machinery are valued at .Â£20,000,000. We have a total value of Â£217,000,000 in respect of these five items. Has the duty on a single line been altered in favour of the Mother Country ? Not one'; in four case* the duties have been either doubled or substantially increased. That does not fit in with the glorious position which the Prime Minister took up at that distinguished gathering at Home. We can readily give a substantial preference if we begin by doubling the duty on imports from the Mother Country. This decaying Mother Country, whose expiring energies elicited the warmest sympathy of the. Treasurer of Australia, has, during the last ten years, increased her trade by Â£322,000,000, or 431 per cent. May I remind honorable members that these figures do not relate merely to imports. Great Britain, in ten years, had an increased importation of the value of Â£156,000,000, but an increase in exports of Â£166,000,000. That is the position of the poor decaying Mother Country !  Her  trade has now risen to- Â£1,000,000,000. In order to show that her marvellous position as a country through which products are exchanged" by other countries is in no way damaged, may I remind the Treasurer that, during this ten years'" period, the increase in her imports which were re-exported was  Â£25,000,000.  Not only are her great internal industries expanding at an unprecedented rate, but that marvellous, that wonderful feature of her  commerce,  which must excite the envy of all nations - the fact that, although she is situated in a remote and inconvenient corner of the globe, she has a re-export trade in respect of imported articles of nearly  Â£100,000,000  a year - is well maintained. The pity and anxiety of Commonwealth Ministers at Home for the condition of England was rather thrown away. They hit upon 'a time when the Mother Country had never seemed so majestic in her power and strength. Duties on wheat and raw materials were asked for. Do honorable members forget that in those three little kingdoms there is a larger area under crop than there is in the whole continent of Australia? We hear men speak of the declining, decaying agricultural industries on a little spot of earth which has been cultivated for  1,000  years, yet there are more acres under crop to-day in the United Kingdom than there are in Australia. The product of the crops of the United Kingdom in a year is  256,500,000  bushels, in addition to about  26,000,000  tons of potatoes and turnips. Surely when protectionists talk of a tax on food, they must think of beginning with some protection for the farmers of England. What an extraordinary spectacle would be presented by the adoption of a policy which excluded the farmers of the Mother Country in favour of the farmers of her great dependencies. The fact of the matter is that this policy of putting taxes on food is not a policy that ever came out of any Liberal camp in the world. It is the old desperate policy of the land-owners of the Mother Country. We ought to remember that. Englishmen, down to sixty or seventy years ago, were half-starved, in order to promote the comfort of a few rich landlords. That was the effect of the food duties in the Mother Country, and all the Tories of England are behind the Radicals of Australia in order that a tax may be placed on food to inflate the value of their agricultural lands. That is the influence which brings this embattled array behind the Australian Prime Minister, Was it not an extraordinary spectacle to find all the Tory squires of England arrayed behind the Prime Minister and Treasurer of the Australian Commonwealth? What a grand <inline font-style="italic">entourage</inline> they had in all those people, whose predecessors, in old days, fattened on the miseries of the poor ! The fact is that a horror of taxation upon food is in the very spinal marrow of the children of the people who were so deeply wronged in days gone by. </para>

                                <para>- That is a local matter. It is well in politics to have more than one idea. That decaying country has engaged in agriculture - its most decaying interest -  2,200,000  persons. There is an aspect of this matter which, I think must appeal to honorable members. The Mother Country has never been slow to respond to the wishes of the people of any of her dependencies. Australia has had - as Canada has had - many proofs of the readiness of the Mother Country to meet their every wish and every desire to the fullest possible extent. Why is it that Britain stands so staunchly against these proposals? I think for obvious reasons. In the first place, we are thanked for any generous preference which we give to the Mother Country unconditionally. In the second place, the people of the Mother Country have not yet realized - and I think never will - that by putting duties on food they would increase the cheapness of the necessaries of life. The bitter experience of their ancestors taught them differently. Ministers like the Prime Minister and Treasurer of the Commonwealth, if they really believe that duties would make food cheaper for the people of the Mother Country, may be full of sympathy and humanity for those people. They say : "If you would only carryout our ideas of managing the affairs of the Mother Country, you would give your people bread cheaper than ever, and enter upon a new lease of prosperity in a sympathetic, practical relationship with the vast self-governing dependencies of the Empire." But the people of England, rightly or wrongly, do not believe that. They believe that taxes on food would make food dearer. They believe that taxes on raw material would cripple the manufacturing strength of' the Mother 'Country. A self-contained people ! Where would England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales be if they were a self-contained people? What a miserable insignificant remnant they would be if their power were limited by their geographical boundaries ! In that remote little spot, far removed from the currents of the great oceans of the world, there is a power which extends its grasp and control over the whole surface of the globe ! Leaving out the self-governing States altogether, there are 400,000,000 human beings in direct and absolute subjection to the power of ' Great Britain. There are 11,000,000 square miles of the earth's surface over which floats the flag of the British Isles as a token of supremacy and irresistible power. A self -contained country ! Why, the glory of Great Britain is that she draws from all climes and all races nourishment to renew the marvellous vitality of her majestic strength. Talk to her of the closed ports of the world, and she will say, " They have been closed against me for a long time, and my people are still thriving." The people of the Mother Country find that those who shut themselves in give to those who do not an opportunity they would not otherwise have. What would be the position of the Mother Country in twenty years' time if the United States opened their doors to the abundance and the resources of the world? Where would the Mother Country be if free-trade were the policy of the world? It is the fact that her manufacturers can bring every resource from all countries of the world without a toll or a tax, which constitutes one of the secrets of her marvellous greatness, </para>

                                <para>- Might I suggest to those who say these 42,000,000 of our English, Scotch, and Irish brethren are a miserable race of starving paupers, that if there are 12,000,000 of starving people in Great Britain, they should, at least, allow the bread of the world to enter freely into British ports. What a marvellous thing it is that the workers of Australia should shut their ears to the appeals of the workers of England. Surely if there is a prescriptive right to statesmanship in a man's position as a member of a Labour Party, those distinguished gentlemen who are members of the Labour Party of Great Britain are worthy of some respect. Can we forget the appeal which Labour members in England have made to their fellow workmen in Australia? And if so many people are starving, can we not understand it? Who clamours to be taxed on bread when he is starving, when he has not enough food for himself, his wife, and children ? Who clamours for a tax on raw ' materials that would interfere with the chance of raw materials being imported from all over the world, and with the facility and freedom 'with which they could be brought into his ports to be converted into articles of human ingenuity ? If you injure the British worker in this respect, will you not increase his misery ? </para>

                                <para>- I think that the honorable member for Corio, even as a protectionist, will admit that if a country is not able to produce enough for its requirements, then such a duty as is suggested has all the elements of a tax. It may be a matter of controversy in large countries where sparse populations are able easily to supply their own wants. For instance, I admit that a duty on cereals here would be like the humour of a Christmas pantomime  so  far as any real benefit to the farmers of Australia would be concerned; bub 'in Eng-' land, where they cannot produce sufficient food for themselves,, surely such a duty  must be a tax. It seems to me that that ought to be pretty obvious. What magic can be worked in such conditions?  I  should like also to point out. that whilst the trade of the self-governing dependencies of the Empire, from which this urgent appeal comes, is a very valuable trade, and compared per head is probably the most valuable trade with the Mother 1 Country - I think there is very little doubt about that - still as a matter of actual employment at present, as represented, at any rate, in British exports, this is the relationship of the trade of the self-governing dominions to the trade of the Mother Country : The trade of the Mother Country with Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand amounts to Â£53,000,000 a year. The trade with British dependencies other than these amounts to Â£60,000,000 a year. The dependencies that are not self-governed take a larger share of British exports than do the self-governing dependencies of the Empire. Foreign countries take British trade to the value of Â£216,000,000 a year, so. that we have Â£276,000,000 of trade between England and countries that are not self-governing dependencies of the British Empire. When Â£276,000,000 are compared with Â£53,000,000, honorable members will understand that it is a matter of grave interest to the people of the Mother Country not to endanger the stability of a trade which is so very important as this trade with other parts of the Empire and with other parts of the' world is shown to be. </para>

                                <para>- That will help them. Let us take the case of India. That country has an open market. The Mother Country sells to India Â£46,000,000 worth of goods, and all the other countries of the world together sell to India only Â£20,000,000 worth of goods. In the free and open contest of enterprise in the East Great Britain sends to India goods to more than double the value of those sent by all the rest of the people of the world. It is an extraordinary fact that whilst foreign countries send only Â£20,000,000 worth of goods a year to India they buy from India Â£73,000,000 worth a year. The position is this: The excess of purchases by India from the United Kingdom amounts in value to Â£19,000,000, whilst the excess of sales to other countries is Â£53,000,000. Honorable members will see that Great Britain has the lion's share of selling to India, while it is left to other countries of the world to perform the useful operation of buying Indian products. </para>

                                <para>- I am not talking of the competition of India with England or with other countries, but with the sales of India to other countries with which Excise duties have nothing to do. Foreign countries send to India Â£20,000,000 worth of goods a year and buy Â£73,000,000 worth. That shows that the people of India must think twice before they favorably consider proposals for preferential trade. It is the foreign countries outside' the Empire that form the backbone of India's 'trade. They ask her to buy little and they buy much. The Mother Country sells much and buys little. This is only one of those problems which men who have the responsible custody of the affairs of the Empire have to consider. In Australia there is a desire to help our farmers and a fear that we may injure our manufacturers. That is what paralyzes preferential trade when its practical phases are considered. When the Prime Minister was so beautifully eloquent in the Mother Country at the table of the Imperial Conference we had in. force a duty of 15 per cent, on exports of apparel from the Mother Country. We have now added to it 25 per cent, and made it 40 per cent. What would have been said by General Botha, who cannot talk much English but who has a sagacious brain, if on the conclusion of the eloquent oration of the Prime Minister of Australia he had been told that the honorable gentleman had the intention when he got back to Australia to make the duty on a large line of British exports 40 per cent, instead of 15 per cent.? Honorable members will perceive the divided duty. The makers of apparel in Australia were knocking at the door ; they got in, and the Mother Country was shut out. Was the 15 per cent, fence put up to a 40 per cent, elevation out of love for the Mother Country or out of a desire to promote the industrial interests of manufacturers of apparel in the Commonwealth? We cannot do both ; we must make a choice. The duty on woollen piece goods under the old Tariff was 15 per cent. . I wonder what the gentlemen who were present at the Imperial Conference would have said if they had been told that that duty was to be increased to 30 per cent. If they had been told that the Mother Country was to get 5 per cent, preference out of the additional percentage, what a sensation of disgust would be created amongst; the millions of British people. Great Britain has to buy her wool from us, and to carry it across the oceans of the globe to the mills in which it is manufactured into piece goods. She takes our raw material, and returns to us the finished product. Surely if there is room for the application of this benign policy, it was not necessary to double the duty. Yet the duty has been doubled in respect to importations from the Mother Country. I have already spoken about the machinery duties. I ask .honorable members to recollect that, whilst the position of Great Britain is a grand one, the enormous Empire under her flag entails vast' responsibilities. The 42,000,000 v human beings who constitute the population of Great Britain are responsible for the security and protection of 420,000,000 scattered over the face of the earth, and for the integrity of 11,000,000 square miles of territory in all parts of the globe. Just think of the " starving " population of the Mother Country being called upon to raise Â£73,000,000 a year for the &lt;&gt; defence of Australia and other parts of the Empire. The ordinary annual expenditure of the United Kingdom upon its Army and Navy is Â£66,000,000, and its capital expenditure for the last year for which I could obtain the figures - I think 1906 - was Â£7,000,000. Great Britain spends Â£73,000,000 a year in protecting the British Empire, and we are to withdraw our little contribution of Â£200,000. We are to break the agreement made by the people of Australia with the Mother Country. We are to say to the "starving" 12,000,000 of the old land, who contribute towards the Â£73,000,000 paid for our protection, " Give us back our Â£200,000. We are not rich enough without it to buy a few torpedo boats for our ports, and want to spend the money ourselves1." The whole of the Customs and Excise revenue of the United Kingdom - about Â£66,500,000 - is absorbed in expenditure on the Army and Navy. What would be thought if it were proposed that' Australia should spend the whole of her Customs and Excise revenue on the defence of the Commonwealth? In addition to the vital necessity of free-trade in food products, even to the injury of her own farmers, and in raw material, another consideration stands for a great deal with the British people. If the conquests of Great Britain had meant the exclusion of the peoples of the other nations of the world from the conquered territories, Great Britain would not have the Empire which she has to-day. Of course, the British fleets have helped to keep other nations quiet ; but these earth-hungry nations have allowed Great Britain to annex territory after territory, because her  policy of an open door gives free entry to them as well as to her own people. That wonderful fact is one of the pillars on which the security of the British Empire rests. The inducement to attack a country whose territories are open to your trade, and who is a large consumer of your products, is not so strong as the inducement to attack -al country which shuts her ports and territories against you. The sentiment of friendship between the United States and the Mother Country is steadily growing. Has the fact that Great Britain buys from the United States Â£130,000,000 worth of goods a year nothing to do with that ? Do not honorable members think that Americans look upon this marvellous fact as a strong reason for not cultivating unfriendly feelings? According to the protectionist idea, what a marvellous convenience Great Britain is to the United States, from which every year she buys Â£130,0*00,000 worth of goods, and to which she sends only about Â£25,000,000 worth in exchange. According to the protectionist idea, Great Britain is beggaring herself to tEe extent of Â£100,000,000 a year, which is the balance of trade in favour of the United States. But that and other facts in connexion with the open door policy of the Mother Country are a guarantee for a great deal. I wish now to refer to one or two of the utterances of the Prime Minister at the Conference - </para>

                                <para>- I hope that we are not wasting time. What is the use of our cudgelling our brains over preferential trade in respect of 150 or 300 items if there is going to be put in a condition which will make the Bill waste paper? My honorable friends can offer as many preferences as they like if they put in a postscript which makes it impossible for the Mother Country to accept them. In spite of her alleged decay she carries more than half the cargoes of the world ; she sells Â£10,000,000 worth of British-made ships to other countries every year. Australia, we are told, has much to gain by preferential treatment. I do not want to deny that at all. Duties on raw material would never be agreed to. But supposing that Great Britain could arrive at a stage at which she thought it was possible to impose duties upon her foodstuffs, I do not say that that might not be of substantial advantage to Australia. I think it would. The amount of the advantage might be problematical, but look what it means. It means a two-story preference. In the first place, the duty would operate as a protection to the 250,000,000 bushels of agricultural, produce which are cropped in Great Britain every year. That would be the immediate result so far as these 250,000,000 bushels are concerned. Then there would be another story of a special character intended to discourage the import of foreign foods. Thus we get two stories in this preference proposal, both of which are directed against the free and untaxed supply of food to the British people. I am sure that no honorable member upon the other side of the Chamber would wish to give a penny in the name of patriotism or of preference in order to get 5s. from the " starving " millions of the Mother Country. I do not think that my honorable friends have reached that depth of meanness. In dealing with the 42,000,000 of people swarming on that little surface - 12,000,000 of whom are said to be in want - surely the protectionists of Australia have not descended to such a depth of meanness and hypocrisy as to wish to put burdens upon the food of those millions without intending to give them shilling for shilling and pound for pound. I do not think that any honorable member would approach this question in that spirit. </para>

                                <para>- Because I wish to draw a conclusion from it. My honorable friend's vision does not go far enough. This is not a matter for argument - it is supposed to be a business suggestion to the people of the Mother Country, its object being to induce them to rebuild the foundations of their fiscal policy. That, in itself, is no light matter. Unless protectionists are prepared to give substantial entry to British manufactures into Australia, preferential trade can never 'become a reality, because, when it comes to a matter of payment, pound for pound will be wanted by the people of the Mother Country. They will not be content to give us a pound and accept in exchange </para>

But it is not necessary to indulge in speech-making now. The question before us is one upon which, we wish to arrive at an agreement; therefore, let us get to business.

But the honorable member must recollect that we have responsible statesmen - apart from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> - making suggestions and proposing schemes. This Committee must recognise that our Prime Minister could not say; to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> " We will allow you to make substantial inroads upon our manufactures if you grant our wheat substantial entry into your markets." That is the point upon which all these reciprocal arrangements are shipwrecked. All sorts of attempts have been made, but they have always broken down because of the rival interests. The reciprocal arrangement with New Zealand was no sooner made than it was repudiated. It was practically stillborn. But that agreement was one of slight importance as compared with an arrangement with the Mother Country. I ask . honorable members to listen to these words of the Prime Minister -  </para>

                        <para class="block">What can that mean? If it meant a genuine, substantial relaxing of the obstacles in the way of British competition in Australia, how could the statement be made? Of course it could have been made in regard to Australian farmers, inasmuch as they .would not be injured by such an arrangement. But how could it be said of Australian manufacturers, assuming, of course, that the preference was to be substantial? If we only intended to pick out a bit of foreign trade here and there, and to say to Great Britain, " We will impose heavy duties upon that trade with foreign countries so that you may ultimately get it," that would be another matter. But if the preference were to be substantial - if it were intended to help great industries, such as the machinery, woollen and apparel industries - great lines of British production which are also important lines of Australian manufacture - if it were to injure the infant industries of Australia, it is very questionable whether the Prime Minister could carry his party with him to that extent. Here is a sublime sentence - </para>

                        <para>What a magnificent sentiment ! One would think that it came out of the New Testament. The Treasurer glowed in the hope for a time when Australians will be a self-contained people. That ideal is the very opposite of the sentiment of "All for each and each for all." The two Ministers do not keep step. </para>

                                <para>- I said " No-yes." That was a logical position. I ask honorable members to note the difference from the stand-point of logic. The transition from " no " to " yes " is an operation of logic which specially distinguishes men who make .bargains. But it is only the fool who at the beginning of a bargain says "yes" and winds up with "no." The Prime Minister, in speaking at the Imperial Conference in April-May of the present year, with the old Tariff before him, under which the duties very rarely reached 25 per cent. - upon machinery the duty was 12Â½ per cent., and upon woollens it was 15 per cent. - said - </para>

But suppose that they went down to the Trades Hall, or to a manufactory in Footscray, or South Melbourne, to deliver a strong freetrade speech, just after a general election, and told the people that protection was a fetish, that they were starving, and would never be happy until they got free-trade. </para>

                                <para>- If that has occurred, I am very sorry to hear it, but I have no recollection of any such abuses. As a man who has been in public life as long as most members of the House, I think I can. say that any departures from the proper rules on the part of the representatives of the Sovereign in Australia have been wonderfully rare, considering that every man is liable to make mistakes. If Imperial Ministers went to meetings which were held in the interests of the Opposition it, to say the least, would create a nasty taste in the mouth .of those who believed in the Ministry and were in policy opposed to the Opposition. </para>

                                <para>- I beg the honorable gentleman's pardon; I cannot say it is because he has any fascination for me. Let honorable members note the significance of that peroration. An increase of 50 per cent, on a trade of Â£26,000,000 is equal to Â£13,000.000. Could Great Britain get additional importations of that value into Australia without affecting our protected industries? The fact of the matter is that if not one-half, a large proportion of the foreign trade consists of articles which we could not, under any circumstances, expect England to send us if our ports were opened to her. </para>

I want to show honorable members the . details of the trade of the. three' great countries which are supposed to be sucking the industrial blood of the people of the -United Kingdom. So far, according to these figures, they have been equal: they have had no preference. Germany and the United States enjoyed just the same rates as Great Britain had. In 1902 the United States had a trade of Â£4,991,000, and in 1906 a trade of Â£47633,000, showing a decrease of Â£358,000 in four years. </para>

                                <para>- I am much obliged to my honorable friend for his remark, for it is a most important addition. In spite of the fact that since 1902 the prices have been substantially higher, the United States - this Hercules among the nations with her population of 80,000,000 and her marvellous and unrivalled resources in a territory of 3,000,000 square miles - goes down in the race to the amount of Â£358,000 in the course of four years. The trade of France with Australia, Â£526,000 in 1902, went down in the four years to Â£462,000 - a drop of Â£63,000. The trade of Ger.many, Â£2,656,000 in 1902, in the four years increased to Â£3,205,000 - an increase of Â£549,000. Putting those three together - those three mighty competitors of England -their trade increased by only Â£128,000 in the four years - or 1Â½ per cent. </para>

                                <para>- It was, of course, inevitable. That sort of argument - it was pushed rather far by the Treasurer - seems to me to be really silly. A young man is bound to grow more rapidly than a full-grown man. It is in the course of nature. Great Britain had a phenomenal, an unnatural, predominance over the commerce of the world forty or fifty years ago. Where was the law of nature. to keep the great peoples of Germany and of the United States in the background? Their trade was bound to grow. Suppose that in a race, one horse being at the winning post, another is half-a-mile away. The second horse may have gained a quarter-of-a-mile in the last mile. But should we, therefore, admire the horse that gains most in the last mile? I think it is the winner that we should admire most all the time. You have to look at this matter from every point of view. Look at the task set to Great Britain,, with a trade of Â£24,000,000, to increase it at all. It is an infinitely greater burden on her to increase her trade from Â£24,000,000 to nearly Â£27,000,000 than for Germany to increase her trade from Â£2,600,000 to  Â£3,200,000.  But instead of that she has increased her trade eight times more rapidly than the combined trade of those other great nations increased. </para>

                        <para class="block">That puts a view which has been put more than once - a view put there very forcibly - of the tangled skein which British statesmen have to unwind. British statesmen have to consider large questions of policy affecting their relations with one or other of the parts of the Empire. There are al multitude of considerations which they must take into account. When, for instance, Australia comes forward enthusiastically with some definite proposal, or when Canada submits a matter of policy, the Mother Country, with the vast weight of responsibility upon her shoulders, has a multitude of other considerations to take into account. But my view of the grievance which the Mother Country has against Australia is this - that Australia, in the person of her representatives, does not mean business. I think that one of the greatest possible wrongs in the higher sphere of Imperial statesmanship is done when ardent and impassioned appeals are made at the centre of Imperial power to re-arrange a system upon which, perhaps, the stability of the Empire depends, not in response to a genuine offer intended to give pound for pound, but in response to an appeal which is not backed up by a readiness to give a fair exchange. </para>

I should like to know that, because even the ablest Prime Minister has to obtain the support of his party, and the party of. the honorable gentleman is not a very numerous one, although I admit that on the question of protection it is comparatively large. It is a matter of great consequence to the public - to the , people of the old country and of the Empire - if the attitude which the Prime Minister describes in that statement, which was made a message to British merchants, is adhered to, that even the preference in this Tariff is only a beginning - to know to what extent and in what direction other steps are to be taken. Are the protectionists of Australia ready to carry the principle of preferential trade te the extent of endangering the growth of Australian manufacturing industries? </para>

                                <para>- For the time I am taking that as an expression which has a substantial meaning behind it, in harmony with the resolution which, was passed at the Imperial Conference, where the same expression was used.' Are [protectionists prepared to endanger the growth of Australian manufacturing industries in order to help Australian farmers? Are they prepared, in order to smooth the path of Australian farmers into the markets of the Mother Country, to make the path of Australian manufacturing more difficult? Are they prepared to endanger the growth of Australian manufactures by making the competition of British manufactures a reality? I think I interpret fairly the views of a great many protectionists when I say that they are not so prepared. If the preference that is to be offered will not affect the manufacturing industries of Australia, it is not worth the serious attention of any man. That would be an absurd basis on which to appeal to the people of the Mother Country to disarrange their present fiscal system - a ludicrous basis. I remind honorable members that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> in the early stages of this great controversy in the Mother Country, so lost himself in an eloquent peroration as to depict the time when British manufactures would have a free entry into the markets of the self-governing Dominions. He painted a bright picture of the opportunity that would be presented, when this door was opened, for British manufacture under some preferential arrangement. But there was a storm at once; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> great man and resolute as he is, had to climb down a great deal, and in an official statement I think he went so far. as to say that he did not wish to interfere with any colonial industries then in existence, but that the effect of his policy would in the future be this - that Australia, for instance, might preserve the little infants she had, but that there were to be no more infants in the manufacturing future of this country - that under the new policy the British manufacturer would provide what was wanted. That, of course, was absurd. Imagine a young and already great country tieing its hands in regard to its industrial development ! <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> had to move from that point of view,  and say that he did not expect to seriously interfere with Australian manufactures. But, first of all, I regard this project as a waste of time under any circumstances. Of course, the next election may show a marvellous change of feeling in the did country, though I do not anticipate such a change. I think that, from present prospects, at the next election public attention will be occupied .with more burning questions than that of preferential trade, and, so far as we can see, the fiscal policy of the Mother Country is more firmly established than ever. That division in the House of Commons of, I think, 498 votes to 90 was a tremendous fact so soon after the general election. The question then decided was put in the most plain and Straightforward fashion ; it could not be shirked, and there was an overwhelming, majority in favour of the existing policy. Honorable members can see that, so long as that policy is maintained, the project of a reciprocal arrangement is impossible. Of course, I do not forget that there are different kinds of protectionists as there are different kinds of free-traders. There are some free-trader? who would not have any duties at all, and, as a rule, those are gentlemen who have another scheme of taxation which they prefer infinitely, absolute free-trade being one means to that end ; and even protectionists may be graded. There is the prohibitionist, which the Treasurer is in his speeches, at any rate, if nowhere else. The prohibitionist is a man who will have nothing short of shutting out all products which can be made in this country. Then there is the high tariffist, who looks- on a Tariff such as we have had as a very milk-and-water production, and who regards any duties under 40 or 50 per cent, as by no means the real thing. Then there is another section, who, I am glad to think, have great weight both in this House and in the country - those who, in adjusting the duties, have some anxiety with regard to other than the manufacturing industries of Australia. I think I may fairly point out the difference between what I call the natural or primary industries of Australia and the industries to which a Tariff is essential, by saying that I call the latter Tariff industries, while I consider Australian industries those which are born and which can expand and strike their roots in their natural atmosphere. </para>

                                <para>- I think it is likely, just as I think it is extremely likely that, if the honorable member were an advocate of measles, he could put forward a most convincing argument in the fact that he had never known a nation which, at some time or other, had not had the measles. That argument, however, would not necessarily mean that it is a blessing to a nation to have the measles. In the Mother Country there was a marvellous appetite for nourishment even among " infantile " industries that had been flourishing for 200 years. It is one of the marvels of protected industries that their infancy is eternal. Their appetite becomes manly, but their appeals for consideration are always those of a weakling, of a child who will die if it is not nourished and sheltered. The moderate protectionist draws a distinction between duties which have sole reference to the interests of the industries for the benefit of which they are imposed and the interests of people engaged in other industries of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- I wish now to refer to the operation of the new Tariff in reference to three very large lines to which I alluded before we adjourned for dinner. Take the item of cotton and linen piece goods. The duty, as against imports of such goods from the United Kingdom, is the same as that under the old Tariff, but to show the wonderful command which the. United Kingdom has in respect of that line over the markets of Australia, I would point out that her exports to this country in one year were of the value of over  Â£3,000,000.  In the markets of Australia Great Britain has to meet on equal terms the competition of the rest of the world, and yet her proportion of the trade is  Â£3,000,000  as against only Â£160,000 for foreign countries. Cotton goods comprise most of the articles coming under the heading of " Linen and cotton piece goods." And yet that decaying country, Great Britain, is able to import cotton from the farthest ends of the earth to supply her own wants in cotton manufactures, and toannuaJly export , Â£100,000,000 worth of manufactures, the raw material of which is mainly produced in the United States and in India. Great Britain obtains cotton from the United States and India, transforms it into manufactured articles,. and sends out every year a surplus of Â£.100,000,000 worth of those manufactures. What is the use of describing as a decaying people a community that is able to take away every year from the United States Â£100,000,000 worth of trade in respect of manufactures, the raw material of which is produced in unparalleled abundance in a part of the States where any quantity of black labour is available. I do not think that we need be very nervous about the position of Great Britain in regard to its industries. Imagine what would be said if Germany could point to this one achievement. The whole world would ring with the story of the decadence of the Mother Country ; it would be said that she was ruined, that her doom was sealed. The old country, with its little bit of earth, which has been ploughed over and over for a thousand years, with its mineral resources, so far as iron is concerned, giving out to such an extent that she spends millions on imports of iron ore from all parts of the world, still sends out this enormous export of cotton and linen goods the raw material of which is not produced within her own borders. What is the use of talking about preferential trade regarding a line of this kind, in respect of which, with the exception of imports of the value of Â£160,000, she holds the whole of our trade? Another wonderful achievement on her part is that she imports wool from all parts of the world, and in one year sends to Australia woollens valued at Â£1,820,000 whilst the rest of the world sends here only Â£78,000. Great Britain is one of the largest buyers of our wool, and yet we find that the duty on woollens is raised against her from 15 to 30 per cent. - that is, by 100 per cent. That is the treatment we extend to her in respect to a line of manufactures, the raw material of which we produce ourselves. It is idle to talk of the little items to which the Treasurer has referred. </para>

                                <para>- Preferential trade was not then dreamt of. In those clays of protection England would not' allow a foreign nation to send even Â£100 worth of goods to a British Colony unless they were first sent to an English port. That was protection hot and strong! Before America gained her independence - when Great Britain had Colonies scattered all over the WOrld- if a merchant in the United States wished to import some French' commodity it was necessary to have that commodity sent first of all to one of the ports of the Mother Country. </para>

                                <para>- The system to which I have referred prevailed under the same policy of protection as we have to-day. The principle was the same, although the manifestations of it were different. What a magnificent spectacle free-trade Great Britain, with her liberal policy, now presents compared with the Great Britain of the Tory, days, when protection was rampant, when  she trampled on the people of Ireland and of every country over which the British flag flew,- in order to maintain the most iniquitous advantages at the expense of the people of her dependencies. She now gives political liberty. She gives even the territories themselves to the self-governing parts of the Empire. She says to the self-governing Dominions and Colonies, " If you think it is wise to tax us we are prepared to endure any taxation you may choose to put upon us." That is a magnificently unselfish position for a dominant power to occupy. We do not hear of Germany, France, or any other nation acting in the same way. The duty on iron plates, corrugated and galvanized, has been increased, and out of a total trade of Â£1,068,000 done in one year in this line with Australia Great Britain has Â£1,028,000 worth. Is it not strange that, having regard to the development of the United States and Germany in respect of metals, Great Britain, meeting foreign competitors' here on equal terms, has nearly the whole trade in respect of this item? </para>

                                <para>- There was no preference at the time I am speaking of. What is the use of giving a preference in respect of goods where no preference is required, whilst at the same time we increase duties at the rale of from 100 to 150 per  Cent,  where the pinch is- felt ? Where there is a pinch between the trade of the Mother Country and the protectionist interests of Australia - such as there is, for instance, in respect of apparel and woollen piece goods - there is no friendly, generous consideration extended to Great Britain. She is treated like a foreign country. .When the Prime Minister,, speaks of "further steps" in this direction one cannot help asking whether they are to be like those already taken : A duty put up against the old country by 100 ,per cent, and as against the foreign countries by 150 per cent. Take the duty on apparel. Under the old Tariff there was a duty of 25 per cent. We now have a duty of 45 per cent, against foreign countries and 40 per cent, against Great Britain. In other words, a preference of one-ninth is given to the Mother Country; 5 per cent,  in  45 per cent. Is the next step to be the imposition of a duty of 60 per cent, against foreign imports and of 50 per cent, against British imports? That would be another advantage to England ! It would mean a difference of 10 per cent, between the duties on foreign and British imports, instead of a difference of only 5 per cent. But it would at the same time mean a duty of 50 per cent, instead of 40 per cent, against British imports. That sort of an  ascending scale really means no preference. It is worse than nothing, because it is the  very opposite of what we profess to do. The Treasurer, by interjection this afternoon, attributed to the Prime Minister of England a statement which I cannot believe he used in its literal sense. It was to the effect that there are 12,000,000 starving people in Great Britain. I cannot speak of the statistics of the United Kingdom, because they have only been kept properly with reference to England and Wales, but the number of able-bodied paupers in England and Wales fifty years ago, when the population was, perhaps, half what it is now, was very much greater than it is to-day. It ran up to something like a million in those days, when the population of England and Wales was about 17,000,000. Those figures refer to people who are capable of working, but are unable to get work to provide them with the means of living. Their number has marvellously diminished, according to the records of the last fifty years. Just think what 12,000,000 starving people, out of a population of 43,000,000, would mean in a country like Great Britain ! </para>

It is a thing our worst enemies have never said of us. They have made many false statements about the British people, but our worst enemies have never been insane or mean enough to make such an accusation as that quoted by the Treasurer this afternoon. It is a vile falsehood to say that 12,000,000 people in England have not the necessaries of life. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member does not know enough about the matter to have anything attributed to him. He was only in England on a visit of a few days. Surely he does not want to be placed in the same class as the many persons who come here for a few days and profess to know more about Australia and about Australian conditions than we know who have lived here all our lives? If there are 12,000,000 starving people in England now, nearly the whole population must have been in that state fifty years ago," because the people of England are infinitely better off now than they were then. I wonder if there is an honorable member opposite who will have the audacity to say that the general condition of the British people is worse than it was sixty or seventy or eighty years ago. </para>

                                <para>- I always hope that the old-age pensions system will never be associated with the idea of charity. That is one of my reasons for wanting to see a certain proportion of the money required to provide the pensions taken from the pockets of those who are to enjoy the benefit, so that no one can afterwards sneer at them and say that they did not find it for themselves. Mo matter what our views are as to how the money ought to be raised, once the old-age pensions system is looked upon as a charity, I would rather not see it established here. I do not want any systematized charity of that sort. </para>

                                <para>- I hope my honorable friend will have the courage to believe that. He is very generous in making that acknowledgment. As I have said, over and over' again, the superfine inhumanity of people who try to put taxes on the bread of starving millions excites my amazement. But if there is any truth in it, those who want to engineer taxes upon the bread of those starving people are in a queer position - especially those who are supposed to be representatives of the working classes. It shows how self-interest will work as against flesh and blood. My honorable and learned friend, the member for Parkes, has given me the exact figures to which I wished to refer. In round numbers, the total population in England and Wales in 1901 was 32,500,000 as compared with 29,000,000 in 1891, ten years before. The total number of paupers receiving relief on 1st January, 1901, was 956,000, being a decrease of 5,000 on the previous year. When the population of England and Wales was only half what it was later, there was an equal number of paupers to provide for. The luxury of the rich few does not come to much when we are dealing with national figures, and I find that the total expenditure of the United Kingdom is set down at Â£878,000,000 a year in 1882, whilst in1903, twenty-one years later, it was reckoned at Â£1,386,000,000. The total yearly expenditure in the twenty-one years from 1882 to 1903 increased by more than Â£500,000,000: That does not look as if the millions of England had a smaller purchasing power. </para>

                                <para>- I am on the question of pauperism. I might admit that numbers do not get enough of production, but I am talking of what the people spend. They would not spend a larger amount if they had not got it to spend, and I have shown that the expenditure of the Mother Country increased to a total of Â£1,386,000,000 per year in 1903. That is a fair expenditure for a population of about 42,000,000. Dealing with four big groups of industries - building, coal-mining, engineering, and textiles - I find that the movement in money wages was from  82.8  in  1877  up to the  100  in  1900.  That was an increase of  17  per cent. between those years. The fall in the price of corn, which is the staple of life - wheat is called "corn" in England - is shown by the fact that whilst in  1871  the price was represented by the figure  100,  the price to the " starving " millions in England in  1902  was represented by the figures  63.7,  a fall of nearly  37  per cent. in the price of bread. That is a tremendous fail in the price of that necessary of life. The fall in the price of meat was not so great; it amounted to not more than  6  per cent. </para>

When the people paid  Â£100,000,000  more than they had previously paid on this account they had to get it and earn it somehow. On food and drink they spent nearly  Â£468,000,000  a year, and the prices of sugar and tea, and articles of that sort, which are amongst the necessaries of life, went down from the index figure of  100  in  1871  to the figure  46.1  in  1902,  a decrease of about  54  per cent, in the period named. Taking the whole of these groups referred to, prices went down from the index figure of  100  to  78.8  per cent., or a decrease of  21.2  per cent. </para>

                                <para>- Let us admit that. It is the  12,000,000  of " starving " people of the United Kingdom that I am referring to. I. desire only to refute that astounding and abominable calumny. The difference in the wages paid in Germany and in England in connexion with skilled trades in the capital cities is the difference between  24s.  and  42s.  per week. In cities other than capital cities the average wage is  36s.  per week in the United Kingdom "and  22s. 6d.  per week in Germany. That is a difference of  13s. 6d.  per week. That is not all that requires to be considered. I would point out that the longest hours have to be worked in- Germany. Of the four countries, Germany, France, the United States, and . the United Kingdom, the longest hours are worked in Germany, the next longest in France, the next in the United States, and in this country, where there are said to be  12,000,000  starving people, the shortest (hours are worked. Iri that old country, with its- teeming millions on a little spot of earth, surely it will be considered a merit by our honorable friends opposite that the workers have to work shorter hours than are worked in the United States? Surely that is something to be proud of? Any one who has the slightest regard for the old country must feel proud that when she has stood the storm and strain of universal protection in other parts of the world against her - including the ports of her own daughter-lands - she is able to pierce these universal barricades, and with her open ports to give her millions shorter hours of labour than are given to the people behind these protective systems, including the people of the United States. There is no doubt that wages are . immensely higher in the United States than in England, but the cost of living in. the American States takes a great deal out of that. Some authorities say that although wages have undoubtedly gone up since the Dingley Tariff, the cost of living has also gone up at such a rate that the increase in wages has practically been- of no benefit to the workers in the .United States. Let us compare Germany and  Great Britain on another important point. I am indebted to the honorable member for Barrier for the figures which. I am giving; they have been taken from a work published in the old country. During the period between 1871: and 1881, the cost of food, in a German workman '-s family might be represented by the figures 11,2, and in an English workman's family by the figures 140 ; but during the four years between 1897 and 1901 the cost of the German .family, instead of being 112, was 100, and that of the British family had made the marvellous improvement of. from 140 to 100. </para>

We must all_ be profoundly sensible that, whilst Aus-' tralia can afford to make mistakes which may cost her very little, a country like the United Kingdom, with the pressure of Empire responsibility upon her, cannot afford to do so. She is not in the position of a youth in the fulL possession of his powers and energies, who can afford to bungle along the path of life, ultimately, despite his mistakes, becoming a successful man. "With the enormous strain upon her to which I have referred, Great Britain finds all the problems which affect her trade' and her fiscal policy of the greatest magnitude and  concern.  There should not be the slightest feeling of soreness on our part if the Mother Country regards this matter in the- light of the interests of its own people. We, too, must look at it from both sides, and I  have  never concealed the  opinion  that, from the 'point of view of the Mother Country, it would be a vital mistake to abandon the system upon which her trade and industry rest.- Therefore, I have ' no grievance against the people of the United Kingdom for refusing to enter into  reciprocal  arrangements. ' I believe that, in doing so they are. consulting their best interests, and that such arrangements would not make their bread cheaper', or the conditions of their masses better, but, on the contrary, would make' things, worse for them. The honorable member for' Corio has made an interjection which was 'frequently uttered by the Prime Minister at the Imperial Conference. When speakers, notably members of the British' Government, used the expression " tax '.' ,in relation to imposts . on food,  he'  interjected more than once, " Not  a  tax,' but a duty." Even  a  protectionist must admit that if goods subject to the Customs_ impost cannot be produced entirely in the country in which they are subject to taxation, the duty on them must have the effect of increasing their price. That  has'  been brought home to us clearly. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- The honorable member's interjection reminds me of the story of the young man who, after some trouble, obtained, his father's permission to go to Paris. When he got there it was raining heavily, so that he had to remain indoors, but whenever he looked out of the window of the hotel, a fair-haired young woman passed. Accordingly he wrote home, " Father, this is no place for me. It is always raining, and all the women have red hair." Faulty generalizations of that sort are often made from imperfect data. It does not follow, because prices went down in England in 1894, that that was due to the imposition of a duty. The fluctuation of prices is brought about by a thousand conditions. If, owing to a drought, the- production of wheat in the United States shows a falling off, prices harden, while if there are good harvests, prices drop. It is an elementary fallacy to attribute a falling wheat market to the imposition df a duty. Therefore I do not think 'that the honorable member for Corio is sound on the point. </para>

                                <para>- My honorable friend has brought me back to the point from which I was straying. Up to a certain point, the wheat duty may have had some protective incidence when Victoria was a separate State. But take Australia.' now, with her enormous wheat production and her small population. The price of Australian wheat is not regulated by the Tariff, but by the markets of the world. Every bushel of wheat that is sold on the farm in Australia is sold at a price which leaves to the buyer a margin of profit after allowing for. the expense of conveyance and shipment and the chances of the market based on the quotations. A fall of a fraction in Mark-lane will affect the wheat market all over the world. </para>

I should be just as foolish as I was tempted to suggest somebody else was if I endeavoured to assign all the causes' for a fall in price in Mark-:lane. There may be many causes. For instance, on the share market, though not so acutely, without any rhyme or reason sometimes the value of shares will go up and down in the most extraordinary way. The market is sensitive and may be frightened. All sorts of elements seem to affect quotations, even in the wheat market. </para>

If we put a duty of 100 per cent, on wool, the price would still be regulated by the demand in the markets of the world. With reference to the proposed duties on food in England, those who believe that they will not increase the prices are- at liberty to enter into these projects in the gayest possible spirit. But  .1  honestly believe that, situated as the people of the Mother Country are, any barrier between them and the abundance of the world would inflict serious loss upon them. Therefore, I support the view which has been so ably expressed by British Ministers, and so emphatically endorsed by the British people, that a preferential treaty would not be a good thing for the Mother Country. No Australian can want to injure the Mother Country, and, what is more,, no Australian can want to interfere with her liberty in fixing her own domestic policy. Sometimes a cruel strain has been put on the people of the Mother Country and their statesmen by insinuations of the sort which I am going to mention, and which' I have not noticed in any speeches by the Prime Minister. In this respect I acquit the honorable gentleman." It has been insinuated that if the people of the </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable member will accept my assurance, I have seen the statement made often, and General Botha referred very strongly to it in the opposite direction. I have expressly acquitted the Prime Minister of making any such statement, but it has been made repeatedly by over-zealous champions, probably more so in the Mother Country than here. During the great electoral struggle between, the Liberals and the Conservatives, this was the most ordinary argument to use:. "Oh, you are alienating the affections of the people of the self- governing- States. If you do not go in for this preference, you will weaken the ties between the self-governing Dominions, such as Australia and Canada, and the Mother Country." I heartily agree - because I have expressed the same sentiment over and over again - with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George in this view, that perhaps the simple secret of the phenomenally harmonious relations which prevail between the self-governing Dominions and the Mother Country might be summed up in a very simple phrase - " This attachment, this harmony, these magnificent aspects of our British Empire, mainly have come from the assertion and the enjoyment of liberty " - liberty in each of the self-governing Dominions of the Empire. This is the life-blood of the strength of the British Empire. Give any of the self-governing Dominions an honest grievance : let the Imperial power, backed up as it is with its mighty fleets, endeavour iri the smallest particular to encroach on the freedom of our political institutions, to make upon us demands which it is in a position to enforce, and , to which </para>

It is a marvellous thing, but it seems absolutely true, that the frailer, the more elastic, the tie which unites the Mother Country with her great self-governing Dominions, the more powerful, enduring, and reliable it becomes. When times of adversity break upon us, and the old flag is flying in troubled skies,, then we lay aside our fiscal differences, ' forget our views about this form or that form of policy, and an elec? trie thrill of sympathy passes to the" farthest extremities of the Empire, which shows that there is a living connexion existing between the great Imperial heart and the farthest Dominions, such as those in these Australasian seas. I believe that to maintain that system, to preserve the marvellous harmony and stability of the Empire, the fewer ties and bargains  we have the better. In those circumstances, whilst I hail with delight any generous unconditional preference which is given to the Mother Country, and which she so richly deserves, so long as she honestly and fearlessly believes in the policy which she has adopted, a policy which I regard as being essential to her stability and her strength, I hope that Australia will be found none the less loyal because the Mother Country asserts, on her part, the independence we claim for ourselves. </para></speech>

                            <para>. - I cannot pretend to possess the power to follow the right honorable and eloquent member' over the vast fields of economic interest filled with social problems which, in the exercise of his undoubted right, he has- thought fit to traverse. It will only be possible for me in the briefest way to attempt in a conversational manner to deal with some of the points he has raised which  relate to the fiscal policy of the Government, and especially to my statement of that policy made in Great Britain, comparing it with the actual proposals now submitted. I hope, by frequent quotations, in an incidental manner to touch upon most, if not all, of the issues which the right honorable member has raised that appear to me to be vital to the question before us. To enter upon a discussion of the different degrees of social progress, rates of wages, or conditions of poverty, which obtain amongst modern nations would launch us upon a sad survey of a vast subject - one far too profound to attempt to drop a plummet line casually into its depths. But we cannot fail to be struck by one contrast. We have heard to-night an impassioned plea from the right honorable member for a grant of preference to the Mother Country  499'4 <inline font-style="italic">Tariff</inline> [REPRESENTATIVES.]   (Cannes,  efic). from her Dominions, but based upon an angry refutation of a statement made by the present Prime Minister of England, shortly before he attained, that office, for exactly the opposite purpose. It was in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> and in order to weight the English refusal to listen to his plea for preferential trade, that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Campbell-Bannerman gave as one of the reasons why it could not and should not be considered that some  12,000,000  or  1.3,000,000  of the people of Great 'Britain being constantly upon the verge of starvation, they could not afford the risk of raising prices ever so little. That statement was afterwards interpreted' by that right honorable gentleman as referring to that large class who are dependent upon their daily labour without any security for its continuance, and who from time to time, therefore, have to face starvation. His statement included all those classes not in settled employment and not provided with the means to face the want of settled employment. The assertion was used by him as the basis for a plea against preferential trade. Curiously enough, it has been absolutely repudiated to-night by my right honorable friend as fatal to the very plea for which it was originally asserted. </para>

The right honorable member for .East Sydney then proceeded to indulge in a series of verbal antitheses, to which I. shall merely allude in passing. According to him. our choice is either between protection or the sacrifice of our industries. To lend any force to this argument he must imply such a degree of protection as would secure to us practically the whole of the trade in any particular commodity. That goes. beyond protection to prohibition. . Failing a full measure of prohibition, according to him, we must sacrifice the whole of our industries to free imports from the Mother Country and elsewhere. Such an antithesis would oniy.be possible if prohibition were being- contrasted with free- imports. It has no relevance to protection. . As. honorable members are aware, there may be a protection of a ,trifling character conferred by a duty of  5  per cent, or  10  per cent., still more protection is conferred '.by a duty of  15  or  20  per cent., and so on, though prohibition may not be reachable even with a duty of  100  per cent. The right honorable member's antitheses go wide of the doctrine we uphold, to which he ought to have directed his word-play. When he went on to say that we were compelled to choose between  the sacrifice of Australian industries to British manufac- 'tures or the exclusion of preference altogether, he again used a short and convenient summary justifiable in a few particulars, but wholly false when applied to industries generally grouped under a single title - as, for example, woollens, textiles, or iron - which in themselves embrace dozens of industries with special- products. Some of .these may be dealt with by one rate, .and the rest by other rates of duty ; some may bear only a light duty, others be subject to a heavy duty ; some bearing no- duty at all, whilst others need no preference. The general statement that protection must necessarily be exclusive of preference applies to a very limited number of cases, and to a- very small' area indeed. When the honorable member passed from such antitheses to the resolutions of  1902,-  to which he pointed as pledging us to a policy of preference of a substantial character, he used only a part of the third resolution re-affirmed at the recent Imperial Conference </para>

                                <para>- But in fairness the qualification embodied in' the third resolution requires to be recalled, and the fourth resolution requires to be read. Besides, so far as Australia is concerned, the whole situation is transformed by the fact that, prior to attending that Conference, we had given notice of a proposal to omit from the fourth resolution the qualification embodied in the words " either by exemption or by a reduction of the duties now or hereafter imposed." We struck out those words. The effect of this is that the offer of a substantial preference on our side was made subject to the condition that we received an equal and similar preference from the Mother Country. Again the right honorable member's shot goes wide. </para>

                                <para>- Yes; in order to attain unanimity. As the proceedings of the Conference disclosed, I voted for the resolutions as they, stood rather than have no resolution passed on the subject of preference from the Mother Country. Better preference by exemption or reduction of duties than no preference at all. But when my right honorable friend seeks to impeach us for inconsistency, it is  Tight  to point out that substantial preference on our part was always made subject to a substantial preference on theirs. ; We may have been wrong, but at least we were consistent. </para>

                                <para>- It must always be so, and, therefore, the imputation of the right honorable member disappears. No one  can  coerce the British Government into giving a sovereign for a shilling. We pointed out from the first that any engagement of this kind must be absolutely free and spontaneous, and, hence there was never a possibility of our imposing upon them the onerous burdens to which the right honorable member alluded several times. I have now to point to a portion of his speech which I repudiate in the most absolute terms. The right honorable member more than insinuated, he almost directly charged me with having taken up an attitude directly or indirectly in the interest of the present Opposition in Great Britain. As a matter of fact, I declined every invitation to every gathering of a party character. There <inline font-style="italic">were</inline> some apparent exceptions, as when we were- the guests of the Eighty Club, of the National Liberal Club, the Palmerston and other clubs, representing the Ministerial Party ; or when we were the guests of the Nineteen Hundred Club, a powerful organization of the Opposition party. </para>

I was assured that the meeting was one of highly representative men, having no party complexion ; a fact indicated in the course of that great influential and enthusiastic meeting - by cheers and other indications that it was not the gathering of a single party. </para>

                                <para>- Not that I remember. It may have been with reference to the main cause of our attending so many meetings and taking advantage of all of them to put our case. To that the right honorable member did not allude, though it is most material. If anything was calculated to demonstrate the propriety of the course we took, it has been the little impression made by this Blue Book when it was flung at the heads of the people of the Mother Country and of Australia. This volume contains the records of the Conference, so far as they were not confidential, published weeks after it had closed, and when the public mind had turned to other questions. </para>

                                <para>- No,, except that in  1887  the proceedings on the opening day were attended by the press and by the leaders on both sides in politics. The whole of the occurrences and speeches on that occasion were reported in the newspapers. But although the general proceedings of previous Conferences had not been held with open doors, we were of opinion that the time had come for a change to be made. When the absolute necessity for the change appeared, and it was denied, we felt that we had a right to appeal to the people outside. The Conference, it has to be remembered, was not a body possessing Executive or legislative authority. Its resolutions did not bind any one. . Yet they were all it had to show. Its members came pledged to expound certain lines of policy ; and unless its meetings where this was to be done took place in the full sight of the people of Great Britain and of Australia, it was bound to fail in its aim. - So far, it has largely failed in that aim. Misrepresentations regarding it are still being propagated even in this House, and these occur because the meetings of the Conference were held behind closed doors. The particular speech alluded to by the honorable member for Parramatta, and which it has been asserted provoked cries of shame, contained no more than the speeches made bv me previously at the Conference itself. Only thus could we convey to the public the views we were sent to express, which could not be grasped from the bald <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> published- </para>

                                <para>- Any one who will turn to those outside speeches made at different gatherings - in the presence of Ministers on some occasions, of the leaders of both parties on others, at several of which the Secretary of State for the Colonies was present - will see that the same ideas were presented to the public as were being presented at the Conference. They were treated in a slightly different manner, but the questions dealt with, especially that of mutual preferences, were those Ave  were  discussing at the Conference. That was our plain duty. When, in  1900,  our delegates  went  Home, representing the several States of the Commonwealth, to endeavour to secure the passing of the Constitution which, with some amendments, Ave now possess, Ave found the Ministry of the day resisting our demand for the acceptance of that Constitution, as passed by the people of Australia, without the additional dotting of an " i" or the crossing of a " t." The Government that was then resisting us represented the party which constitutes the Opposition of to-day, while the Government of to-day consists largely of members of the then Opposition who generously came forward to assist us. There was no accusation at that time that in taking the course Ave did Ave were endeavouring to support the Opposition. On both occasions the .Opposition supported us.' In a country in which party government obtains, the appearance of party relationships of some kind can scarcely be avoided. Nor need they be avoided, when all that is said arid  clone is said and done in the eye and ear of the public. Preference is as much our question as it is a British question, vet. although OVerwhelmed with invitations to Tariff Reform meetings, and often pressed to take part in other gatherings capable of bearing a party complexion, on no occasion did my colleague, the Treasurer, or myself attend any part \ meeting, or any meeting at which a. resolution affecting British party politics was proposed or carried. </para>

                                <para>- The question  was  put to the vote, but in conference, as my right honorable friend knows, the understanding is that, unless unanimity obtains, there is no action. There was one Dominion against complete publicity, and that one was enough. To return to less personal matters, it appears to me that we suffer, as all political, philosophical, and theological discussions suffer, because of a loose application of terms. There is a great deal of ambiguity in the arguments which have been addressed to this Chamber in reference to preference, because of the several senses in which the term may be applied; and until we get a very much more elaborate terminology that looseness of usage is perhaps inevitable, though it is extremely  embarrassing. Now, so far as we are concerned, we did not fail at every turn to intimate, both in the Conference, and outside - having the' Conference Official Reports before me, it is .to these alone I shall refer - that, when we spoke of preference, we aimed at something very much wider than that word might at first appear to convey. It is scarcely possible to use a single word which shall cover all that is associated with the greatest of great movements within the Empire for the co-operation of all its parts. What we aim at is, as a British Minister put it,. " the free union of free Commonwealths. !! Towards that great ideal there are many ways of approach ; and it must not be forgotten that we were obliged to use the word "preference'*' continually when, covering or referring to one or other of these, besides the very great means of preference that is presented to us by our Tariffs. From the very first I pointed out. as, for instance, at page  259,  that - </para>

                        <para>We included any association  fur  mutual ends, by means of improvements in our shipping communication, of our cable communication, or of our .postal facilities. I went on to sketch the possibility of a committee of experts being appointed, who would periodically review the trade of the Empire as a whole in order to retain trade as far as possible within the Empire, pointing out that the idea .was capable of indefinite expansion, and that there were many stand-points which we could not yet attempt to touch. We were in favour of the adoption of every means  pf  cooperation for common ends. I had already written a despatch, the first from any Dominion challenging the maintenance of the high rates of charge on the Suez Canal. We asked for a reduction, either by the British Government itself - the possessor by means of a happy investment of an enormous interest in the Canal, from which it receives a superb return - or. if that were not directly possible, for some indirect assistance by which we could meet the needs of our shipping. Having raised that question by despatch and received a refusal, I was not deterred from including that at each opportunity, as one means available for Imperial co-operation. In addition to the reduction of freight charges, we referred to the direction of the great stream of emigration from the mother country to coun-tries under our own flag, instead of to countries under foreign flags. These and other methods of co-operation were pressed forward in the Conference and out of it where-ever opportunity offered us open- doors or open minds in order to provoke and promote schemes worthy of practical consideration. </para>

"One country with an infinitesimal marine already pays out of the Government dues the charge on its ships. I took the opportunity of calling attention to' a practical concession, which could be adopted, if the whole of the reduction asked could not be made. At present, passenger steamers passing through the canal pay a due on the whole of the passenger accommodation, although little of it may be occupied. There are certain seasons in the Australian trade when, as a matter of fact, the mail ships and other vessels carry very few passengers, and yet are charged ' on the whole of the accommodation. I made the very simple and reasonable request that, although I believe the vessels are in regard to cargo charged on their gross tonnage, so far as passengers are concerned, there should be a concession to commence with by charging only for the accommodation occupied.

We may have a strong and clear opinion as to how the other bargainer should proceed, in. his own interest, but after all, that is his affair. We may regret that we cannot do the business,, but necessarily we must in every case bow to&gt; his decision. So, in -the present instance, it appears to us to be possible for each to impose duties on a certain scale - putting aside the advantage which may be gained from those duties- - granting each other preferences under them without loss or- risk of loss. </para>

Even, in this assembly, comparatively familiar with fiscal duties, confusion frequently arises. as to what "high" and "low" duties mav be, and in order that there might be no mistake I went on to say that -  15 per cent, wilh .is ranks as a very moderate duty, indeed, in most cases. </para>

I took especial care, in that ease (as well as in others) to safeguard the members of the Conference against any misapprehension by pointing out that with us 15per cent., as a rule, was a very moderate duty. Having so paved the way to an understanding of the scale of duties we had in mind, I went on to point out that there were two modes of preference - </para>

                            <para>The Commonwealth may proceed either to lower existing duties in favour of Great Britain or to increase these duties to the foreigner. This latter course has been followed in Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, and probably in no perceptible degree influences' the amount of duties collected. The immediate object of preference in our case would be to exclude foreign goods and to favour British goods. On a more general view, and subject to this, its object is to obtain fair terms abroad where fair terms are granted <inline font-style="italic">byus,</inline> It is natural then, that the extent of the preference should be such as to be calculated to accomplish the first of these objects - that is, the cessation of importation of foreign goods, and 'an increase of present duties would seem to be the best means to achieve this end. </para>

                                <para>- The right honorable member thinks that it might be supposed that this suggestion of an increase related only to the duties on goods from foreign parts. To that I shall recur in a few minutes. I went on to point out the field of preference afforded in the first instance by our free list, which covered nearly 34 per cent, of our total imports. In that direction, I said, it was possible to do a great deal, and we have done much in regard to them under the Tariff proposals now before us. At the same time, I warned the Conference - and this shows that I was speaking not merely of an increase of the duties on foreign goods - that an increase of local production must be allowed for where our circumstances were favorable. At page 258, pursuing another line of exposition, I said - </para>

                                <para>- I doubt if any member of the Committee, who is indebted to the brilliant speech of my right honorable friend for his knowledge of the proposals that we actually submitted, had any suspicion that there were such pertinent and practical passages, in this report, dealing with the very problems with which the right honorable member was gallantly wrestling without making any reference to them. No one who reads can doubt for a moment what we proposed. Our preferences were to be proportioned to theirs. So far from our standing alone, the same attitude was adopted not only by Natal, Cape  Colony, and New Zealand, but by 'Canada, the greatest and most populous Dominion of all. </para>

                                <para>- I do not quite catch the honorable member's meaning, or he does' not catch mine. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier said - page  411  - that a complaint had been made -  that the Canadian preference has not done as much for British trade as had been hoped for. I repeat, there is a way of doing it. It is bv adopting a mutual system of preference. But again, I suppose, the British Government represented here may say, "No, we are not prepared to do that. We might improve our trade with our self-governing dependencies, but whilst we might do this, we would disturb the whole ,Y SO tem of trade, and would lose, perhaps, more than we would gain otherwise, by disturbing the whole system of trade that we have in this country." This is a question  which  is not for us. </para>

                                <para>- It might be anything that both Parliaments thought fit. Precisely the same attitude was taken up by the representatives . of the other self-governing Dominions. They all said, " So far as we are concerned, what we seek* is reciprocity with the Mother Country - a preference extended to us and a preference granted by us - the question of the details of those preferences to be worked out, as they must necessarily be, according to the judgment of the several Parliaments concerned." Until we were at one, of course the arrangement would not be mutual. -As already said, whatever preference were given to us we should at least balance by equal preferences of our own. That mutual preference meant far more than that .which we now propose. This is a preference by way of gift without return, made as an indication of good-feeling and attachment. The context must be examined with regard to the word "preference" in each case to discover when we were referring to reciprocity - preference by return - or only to preference by gift. In several of the passages cited to-night by the right honorable member, the Statements relate to the reciprocal preference and not to the preference which is before us at the present time. </para>

He entered into most careful and elaborate calculations before we left this country, and, on my expressing doubt as to the estimate which he had formed, pointed out that he meant the estimate of  50  per cent, to apply to the circumstances which would arise if, in consequence of preference being granted for our agricultural products in the Mother Country, larger areas of land' were placed under cultivation in this country, a larger population found employment on the soil, the consumption of British goods brought here under preference being by that means increased. He said it was fair to assume that, .within a comparatively short period,  those circumstances would lead to an increase of  50  per cent, in our importation of goods from Great Britain, only a part of that increase being gained at the expense of the foreign goods which at present enter into competition with them, the rest being derived from the great growth  which he foresaw in our consumption of. British goods under the stimulus of preference. _  </para>

In order to show that we approached this subject from a perfectly equitable stand-point, I took pains to give "the rather unnecessary reminder - page 236 - that we recognised to the full the perfect right and freedom! of the Mother Country, consistent with her adoption of this policy, to levy protective duties against us on any and every product that she thought fit. I said that we made our proposal subject always to the condition of .the  complete freedom of the Mother Country to impose duties upon our products to any extent she thought  necessary  in regard to her own local consumption. </para>

                                <para>- I remember that proposition. It really resolves itself into a Question of the class of manufactures. If the right honorable gentleman said, "You shall not increase your duties upon your iron manufactures," that would be an impossible condition. But if he said, as he reasonably might-" Here are a great quantity of high-class iron goods, which can only be profitably made in huge quantities; you in Australia cannot at present consume'  such  quantities; you 'cannot expect to start manufactures on a sound basis for that particular kind of goods; offer them no protection, but allow us a preference on them, and then,' instead of suffering, you gain, and we gain also" - that would be a different thing. </para>

                        <para>For the first time in the history of the world we have managed to reconcile, what hitherto has been found irreconcilable in every political combination, namely, the completest development of local liberty and independence without impairing, nay, rather with an enhancement of, a sense of corporate unity and attachment between the parts and the whole. If that is true, gentlemen, of our Empire as a whole, of its structure and its foundations, nowhere is it truer, I think, than in this department of fiscal policy. It is by giving, as the Mother Country has done, complete fiscal autonomy to her Colonies - I will not say only by that, but it is partly by that, and largely by . that - that we have succeeded in arriving at a working Imperial arrangement. </para>
                        <para>There was no hostility to our doctrine of "Australia first." He went on to say that he would not. even criticise our fiscal policy, though he did not agree with it, and then at page  307  of the report he showed his complete -understanding of our intentions. </para>

Both these newspapers admit, in articles on the present Tariff, that, as framed and submitted here, it is exactly in consonance with what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne and I stated in Great Britain. They say that any persons who have been misled have been misled owing to their own fault. The <inline font-style="italic">Westminster Gazette</inline> says no statements could have been more explicit than ours. </para>

                            <para>It cannot be too clearly understood that this matter stands clean outside the fiscal;, controversy amongst ourselves. Canada gave preference without entering into a- . bargain. : Australia, in the same way, provided for special treatment to the Mother Country without making, any stipulations or waiting for a return. In the " second case, as' in the first, we were offered 'something and were asked for nothing. Whether the absolute' worth of the Commonwealth concession be more or less - and it has been much better worth having than is generally thought - its. withdrawal would be a sheer, unmitigated loss to British trade. It would be impossible to stigmatize too harshly the- folly of those responsible for such a calamity. </para>

What .then becomes of the plea of our Cobdenites  in Australia professing, to protest on behalf of the Cob.denites in Great Britain, while these last are saying openly . that; there, can be nothing unsatisfactory to the Mother Country because of increasing Tariffs in .other parts of the world. </para>

                            <para>We heartily concur in the view which has been presented by colonial Ministers that the Empire would be a gainer if much of the products now purchased from foreign countries could be produced and purchased within the Empire. In Britain we have the greatest market in the world. We are the greatest purchasers of produce raised or manufactured outside our own boundaries. A very large proportion of this produce could very well be raised in the colonies, and any reasonable and workable plan that would tend to increase the proportion of the produce which is bought by us from the colonies, and by the colonies from us and from each other, must necessarily enhance the resources of the Empire as a whole. </para>

Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George is a confirmed free-trader, making no departure from the faith, except, as I shall presently show, under certain possibilities, he "grasps the fundamental principle underlying them, which is the employment of ' the forces of the Empire to develop its resources. He said again that the preferential Tariffs already in force in other Dominions - and remember that they were made by raising their own Tariffs first, and then raising them more against the foreigner - were " substantial concessions." Canada has added to hers of late. Yet on page 386" he describes the preferences as "enormous advantages." On page 387 he says that Great Britain was grateful for the concessions, and recognised the spirit of comradeship in which they were made. Consequently, we have from the lips of the  President  of the Board of Trade a sufficient statement of appreciation from the British Government - by free-traders, who grant no preference, remember; by those who are usually supposed to attack preference. We have these frank admissions on the face of this report. Nevertheless in regard to ourselves there is a significant admission by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George on page 372, when he said - </para>

                                <para>- At present we have no proposal for any kind of reciprocity from the Mother Country, and consequently all the statements which are to be found in these reports relating to reciprocal preference, no longer apply. We proffer a preference of the same class and character as that already given by Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, but we have illustrations in the German and French Colonies of reciprocal preferential trade in those countries. Algerine grain is admitted free to France, while foreign grain is taxed at the rate of 12s. 3d. a quarter. In German Colonies German goods are exempted or placed on a lower scale. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd'</inline> George went so far as to say, on page 393 - </para>

                                <para>- That is a large question. Another consequence of the neglect of reciprocity by the Mother Country is that Canada has now an intermediate Tariff, and, from a cablegram which has arrived during the last few days, we learn that negotiations are already on foot with Germany and Italy. This means that the British preference hitherto granted by Canada will be reduced by exactly the amount of that intermediate Tariff to these two countries - one of them the most formidable competitor the Mother Country has. That is because <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier's proposal for reciprocal preference,  again repeated at the last Conference, has been declined. </para>

Now we have two out of the three Dominions which have already granted a preference, qualifying it on account of the absence of reciprocity. But, for all that, we have the best of reasons for proposing a preference, and a liberal one. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. In the first place, we have the example which has been set by every self-governing Dominion - South Africa, Canada, and New Zealand.  And, in addition to that, we have this fact - that, whilst it is true that there is no discrimination in our favour in the Mother Country, there is a discrimination against us in some foreign countries. The Mother Country gives us no greater advantages than she gives to the foreigner ; but in Germany to-day there is a distinct discrimination against certain Australian goods. Germany subsidizes steamers, which are not allowed to take meat and other of our raw products, to German markets. That discrimination is being adopted by Sweden and another European country, to some extent. </para>

                                <para>- And for many other reasons. The greatest reason of all I do not propose to enter upon because it really does not come within the scope of this debate. It seems to me that the relations between the Mother Country and the self-governing Dominions are now in process of re-adjustment, and that this must go on" until, on clearly thought-out arid well-established lines, we have adjusted our relative responsibilities to each other. These are incidental to our approach towards national manhood and can no longer be put aside. But each requires to be dealt with as far as possible 'on its own merits. To-night the leader of the Opposition indulged in some persiflage with reference to the possible defence proposals of the Government, which will be dealt with in clue course. But it is undesirable to confuse the defence question with the trade question. It is true that we owe all he said, and more than, we can say, to the protection of the British flag and fleet. I have urged it" again and again for many years. But this is to be met by the discharge. of our responsibility in connexion with the defence of the Empire.  That can partially be measured, and ought to be related to defence as a whole. In the same way it appears to me that we require to consider trade in respect to trade, and to adjust our mutual commercial relations through the freedom of our markets, and share all  the advantages which' we can obtain from trade preferences. .. And so of the several other relations which we are now establishing, most of them imperfect and unformulated, and all of them open to -definition and. improvement. We can attempt to re-adjust them one by one. Among the greatest tasks which lie before us, so Boon as our hands are somewhat freed from the great and pressing questions of a local character that now confront us, must be the taking up in connexion with local questions of the issues involved in our Imperial relations until these are fully and fairly balanced. The most encouraging feature is that, on the part of the British people and its Parliament as a whole, there is to-day an even more generous spirit than has obtained hitherto. In recent years there has been carping from some quarters at the Do minions for not having taken their share of the defence burden of the Empire. The last debate in the House of Commons, when that question was considered, was marked by- a striking speech from the leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour,</inline> with which '-"the Government immediately associated itself. This proceeded exactly on the same broad lines as the official statement afterwards made to us by Lord Tweedmouth on behalf of the Government Although they felt that we had a responsibility in connexion with Imperial defence, hey left it to their self-governing Dominions to determine - for themselves how rar, when, and- to what extent, they would undertake to share that purden. Greater and more generous treatment there could not possibly, be. .It is upon the sentiment thus expressed and the practical developments that we may anticipate from it, that .we may confidently rely to bring us and keep us together in the future. Sio, though as to the Tariff we were met by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> in an absolutely uncompromising manner - as my quotations will have shown - it was with the utmost courtesy and consideration, and an almost anxious desire to avoid trespassing, even for a moment, upon the privileges which had already been conceded to us. Having been met in that spirit, it seems to me absolutely, essential that the self-governing Dominions of their own accord should take into serious consideration their relations with' the Mother Country with a. view of discharging, according to their own consciences, and their consciousness of the fitness of things, their duty ' in regard to' the world-power under whose shelter we have grown up. Under its shelter- our children must continue' while rising gradually to. the full measure of their responsibilities, within the Empire to the end of time. This digression is cognate, because it brings me back to the question of granting a preference to the United Kingdom at the present moment. That preference is due upon commercial and trade grounds alone. I .put it upon no higher grounds now, because it is to be dealt with as a matter of business. At the same time, 1 realize that considerations of business in this instance can be as much invested with spirit, sentiment, and aspiration as if there were no bargains We bring forward our proposals with far greater warmth, zeal, and hope for their future development than we would do if they merely represented a business transaction. They ought to represent  at  contract of the character that a father would make with his son upon the latter entering into business on his own account. These arrangements are very different from- those which they would make with outside competitors. Therefore, this Committee will do well for itself and well for the Commonwealth if it grants such a preference as is here proposed. This particular schedule must be .of a temporary character, because, by carefully observing the effects of each of these concessions, we shall seek to discover, those which! are practicable, those which may be further extended, and those which should be withdrawn as having failed in weir effect. Hereafter, in the light of experience, we shall be able to do what, at present, we can only attempt in a general and theoretical fashion, that is, to foster trade with the Mother. Country where it will best suit her development and that of the Commonwealth. I have put the matter in this way, although we are now viewing it from our own side of the shield. Despite the coldness with which our overtures for reciprocity, are being received in the Mother Country, I have by no means abandoned the opinion that it will not be long before we discover a change in the attitude lately adopted towards us. in this matter, and in the course Great Britain will be prepared to take.  Her  feeling for the Dominions could not be warmer than it is at present, and, if I am not much mistaken, it will find adequate channels of expression before many, years. If asked why I venture this daring prophecy about a country with which I can claim no immediate political acquaintance except -that which has been derived during three short visits, I turn for one illustration to the impassioned language of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, than whom there is no more determined free-importer.

We agree with our Colonial comrades, that all this is worth concerted effort, even if that effort at the outset costs us something. The federation of free Commonwealths is worth making some sacrifice for. One never knows when its strength may be essential to the great cause of human freedom, and that is priceless. I am not one of those who believe that the value of great ideals is to be assessed always by Board of Trade returns.

                                <para>- When we speak of the treatment which our goods have received in foreign ports, we have to remember that which was meted out to our ships, in the Marshall Islands - a wrong winch has remained unredressed even to this day, and for which a reasonable demand has been knocking in vain at the door of the Chancellor at Berlin during the past eighteen months or two years-. How can foreign powers who take that course of action wonder if we extend preferences elsewhere, and even impose disabilities upon them? Before I conclude, may I remind the Committee - as my honorable colleague has done in detail - that the preference proposed at present covers  Â£15,000,000  worth of British goods, upon some lines of which, at all events, decided inroads have been made? Within the last few days I have learned, from communications direct from several houses interested in importing leading lines, that deliberate attempts - quite proper and reasonable attempts in their way - are being made to undersell some of the staple products in which, to-day, Great Britain holds the pride of place, by a deliberate reduction in the ordinary prices of foreign goods brought here. I have had evidence placed in my hands relating to a particular line in which the foreigner has no footing whatever, and in which his prices have been reduced below the cost of production in order to obtain our trade. This is only one of several dangers. Whilst Great Britain now holds  Â£15,000,000  worth of trade which will be affected by the proposed preferences; experience shows that she must not rely upon retaining it, and, therefore, any assistance we can render her must be counted. The preferences proposed also cover Â£9,000,000 worth of goods from foreign countries, over all of which the British importer will obtain an advantage. I propose only to mention the effect of our preference upon seventy-six items which will be free to the United Kingdom, sixty-six of which will be subject to a  5  per cent. duty in the case of a foreigner, and ten of which will bear a  10  per cent duty. These affect nearly three and a half million pounds worth of imports, of which one and a half millions are foreign goods. </para>

                        <para class="block">Our preference protects the three and a half millions, and gives Great Britain the opportunity of competing for the one and a half millions a year. I am informed from a careful calculation that this will probably mean a trade of three millions to the Mother Country at once. I have taken out a list of some twenty odd lines in which foreign competition is or may become severe, and on. which this preference will afford considerable relief, but pass from this because  1  have already exceeded the time for which I thought it would be possible for me to address the Committee, or for honorable members to consent to listen. I had intended to allude to another proposal which was received at the Conference - if I may use the expression - with scant courtesy. It was that, following the original suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">.Mr. Hofmeyr,</inline> in 1.887, afterwards elaborated by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Sydenham Clarke, there should be formed an Imperial fund, contributed to by all the Dominions, to be devoted to Imperial purposes. This fund was to be raised by the imposition of a rate to be agreed upon, equivalent to a duty of 1 per cent, or less upon foreign imports-, together with a condition enabling a country which did not desire to impose such a duty to make its contribution in some other fashion. This proposal for the establishment of an Imperial fund to be devoted to the encouragement of quick and cheap communication between the mother land and her oversea Dominions, or cheaper freight for British manufacturers, and cheaper freight for our producers here, cheaper cable messages, the lowering of canal rates, or in any other manner in which we could increase trade and intercommunication between the parts of the Empire - this proposal was first scouted and then ridiculed. So strong  was the Little Englander spirit which, having banged the door on the policy of preference, bolted and barred it, then practically rejected a proposal for Imperial union for Imperial ends, only making at last a lame effort to frame a meaningless resolution which we declined to adopt. </para>

                                <para>- But, as I pointed out at the time, the 1 per cent, was merely put as a figure for purposes of illustration. Any other amount could have been substituted. Mine was a proposal for the establishment of some fund for Imperial purposes. The 1 per cent, was only suggested as a measure. Each Parliament would have controlled its own contribution. It was simply to be dedicated to Imperial purposes by each, so that there was no interference with its self-government. There was also a debate on the proposal for an "All Red Line" - an old proposal known for ten or twenty years in this country - which is now being discussed with warmth in Canada. I fear that the direct or indirect interest of Australia in such a line is at present small. Nevertheless we supported the proposal on Imperial grounds so far as it affected Canada. What helps one Dominion helps all'. A precedent of this kind would have been valuable to us. That is all the gain we should have had from it now. To send ships quicker to Canada than to New York would have been an Imperial gain. The British Government has already subsidized ships to New York, arid", having done that, why not subsidize steamers to connect with their own Dominions, and make the route through Canada the quickest route to the East, and perhaps in the future to Australia? </para>

Canada has more claims on the Imperial Government than we have, and has recently proved in connexion with the Japanese and other treaties - matters of great moment - that she is able to make her weight felt. She may succeed, having the immense assistance of the great Canadian Pacific Railway, with its enormous resources in money and of influences behind it. That great company patriotically wields its influence to benefit Canada, being a very great land-holder in Canada. Hence the company's influence is used in helping Canada in matters of consequence. I am happy to read in the Canadian papers and reviews - in the <inline font-style="italic">Canadian -Magazine,</inline> for instance - expressions of opinion decidedly encouraging from the Australian point of 'view. The <inline font-style="italic">Canadian Magazine</inline> reminds us that just the same cry as is now being raised in some quarters against the Australian Tariff was raised against the Canadian Tariff when it was introduced. But it adds that Canada declined to be affected by outside interests which clashed with those of her own people, and Australia is urged to do the same. I find in the daily newspapers of Canada that, although they do not hope for much in the way of a reciprocal arrangement with us, they nevertheless point out that Australia is taking the course that Canada has already followed. When Australia makes her weight and influence felt, as Canada has done, it will be recognised in England that in building up our own resources in this country we are doing the best service we can for the Empire. It is not for us to remain dependent; in these respects. It is for us to blaze our own trail and follow it, maintaining a policy which will be beneficial to. the Mother Country, since it will enable us to go more efficiently to her aid in any hour of need.

                                <para>- In no way directly, but we are at present being subjected to certain criticisms in the House, and by the foreign trade party outside, who object to Australia judging for herself; urging that she should be governed by other considerations. To these, with apologies for having detained the Committee so long, I make this brief reply. The present proposals for preference, incomplete as .they are, and immature as they must be, requiring, like other political proposals, to be adapted from time to time to circumstances, were the best that could be made just now. They are an instalment of preferences which, if adopted, can and will be made more effective as time goes on. I trust and believe it will be seen that the real object we have in view is to adopt a distinctly different line of conduct towards the Mother Country, and to approach her commerce in a distinctly different spirit, with a warmth of blood begotten of kinship and community of interest such as no other power can claim. All. questions affecting our trading and commercial relations with the Mother Country must be approached with the sentiment of the family, otherwise such schemes will have been launched in vain. I confess that this schedule is imperfect - it is temporary - as all fiscal proposals must be, but believe it will accomplish much more than is anticipated. The leader of the Opposition to-day, in one of his passages, pointed out that the increased trade between independent powers such as the United States and England had made for peace, harmony, and strength between the two countries. If that be so, how much more will increased trade between the Mother Country and her Dominions make for increased harmony, strength, and peace within the Empire? I accept the right honorable' gentleman's argument, and apply it here. In another glowing passage he referred with disdain to the. impossible ideal of making Australia a self-contained country. He said that it was folly to hope or believe that it would be well for Great Britain to be self-contained. There is another ideal which includes both. We are confident that the Empire, if not self-sufficing, can approach more nearly to that condition than any other power in the world. Every climate, every soil, every source of wealth, every means of strength and greatness are already within its bounds. </para>
