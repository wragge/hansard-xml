I should like to ask him whether he is aware that in the public schools of South Australia at the present time cadet uniforms are lying rotting for want of caps, and that the boys are leaving the schools. Will he see that these uniforms are utilised, and that the parents of the children who have left the schools have the amounts which have been paid by them for the uniforms refunded ? </para>

                        <para>- I cannot give the honorable member the details as to why there has been delay in instituting legal proceedings. The matter is in the hands of the Crown Law officers, and since I have returned from England I have myself made the same inquiry as the honorable member has put to me. I do not think it will be long before definite action is taken. </para>

We have recently heard a good deal in connexion with the public demand for the abolition of certain old-time forms of procedure which are adopted in our parliamentary institutions. I confess that I for one greatly sympathize with that demand. I know that it is difficult to get rid of time-honoured customs- </para>

One cannot move amongst the people without hearing dissent from the great waste of time which appears to them to take place in following these time-honoured customs.

                        <para>- Perhaps that is why I desire to get rid of it. During all the years that I have followed politics I have never been able to see that it serves any useful purpose whatever, except possibly that of enabling some honorable members to let off a little "steam." I am told that there are great objections to the abolition of the Address-in-Reply, and that its disappearance would simply mean that the Ministry of the day could do practically what it pleased. Personally, I have never known a Government able to do what it liked if Parliament did not choose to fall in with its wishes. It appears to me that a considerable amount of time is spent in criticising the actions of the Government without anything tangible resulting from that criticism, and in criticising measures with which it is proposed to deal during the session. When those measures come to be dealt with, all that criticism has to be repeated. It appears to me that that time might very well be saved. Time would be saved, and nothing disastrous would happen if the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply were dispensed with. We know that upon one occasion in this State, what was regarded as an extremely cot servative Government, when they deemed time to be precious, did not hesitate to dispense with it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not speaking of what happened afterwards. Since we last met, two great events of importance to the Empire have occurred in the old country. I refer to the holding of the Imperial and the Navigation Conferences. I think that everything which can be said in connexion with the Imperial Conference - until we read the full report of its proceedings - has already been said by the leading men of Great Britain, by the representatives at the Conference, and by the press. It would simply be vain repetition for me to say anything further in connexion with the work of that body. But as I am the first member who has had the honour of addressing the House since the Imperial Conference was held, I think I may take the liberty of saying that the members of this Parliament, wherever they may sit, have the very highest appreciation of the services which the Prime Minister rendered as Australia's representative. We know that before he left our shores it was hinted that this Parliament would require an explicit declaration of the policy which he was going to propound upon that occasion. Indeed, one prominent member went so far as to say that the Prime Minister should certainly not be permitted to attend the Conference with a blank promissory note signed on behalf of Australia. The House, to its own credit, and to the honour of the Prime Minister, thought otherwise, and sent him to that Conference untrammelled and uninstructed, with a blank promissory note, knowing perfectly well that he could be thoroughly trusted to do what was right on behalf of the country which he represented. We know very well how he fulfilled that trust, and when we read the high opinions expressed by his fellow representatives, by the leading men of Great Britain, as well as by the press of the mother country - expressions both of friends and opponents, I do not use the word " foes," because he has none - of our Prime Minister's fearlessness, of his bold yet courteous demeanour; of his frankness, combined with discretion; of his loyalty and unselfishness in returning to Australia without any reward except the consciousness of having done his duty, we wonder whether this is the same man who six months ago was vilified from one end of this State to the other as one who was deceitful, treacherous, false to his friends, and even selfish. Following as it did upon this storm of abuse - a storm almost unprecedented in Victoria - the triumph which- the Prime Minister scored in Great Britain was the more magnificent. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate our representatives at the Navigation Conference upon the success which attended their efforts. When the names of three of the proposed representatives - including that of the honorable member for South Sydney - were mentioned, they were described as Socialists, who knew nothing about the matters with which they would have to deal. </para>

                        <para>- I am referring only to three of the four representatives first proposed. Bearing in mind this criticism, I think that the success of our representatives is all the more gratifying. Perhaps the most pleasing feature of their achievement is not merely that they accomplished so much, but that no one in the old land appears to have thought that their proposals were the dangerous or absurd ones that they were represented in this country to be. This is only another illustration of the truth of the assertion so often made that the conservatism of the Conservative Party in Australia is far more pronounced than is that of the Conservative Party in the old country. Holding the views, to which I have already given expression, with reference to the Address-in-Reply, I need scarcely say that I: do not propose to occupy, much time in discussing the details of  His  Excellency's speech, or in criticising, more or less, the measures therein foreshadowed. There are, however, one or two matters to which I shall briefly refer. It is gratifying to learn that the repatriation of the kanakas which, we were told, would be a difficult and dangerous process, has been attended with very great success. It is also satisfactory to know that the Government propose to deal with the two legal difficulties that arose during the recess. I refer more particularly to their intention to more clearly define by legislation the position of the High Court under Section 74 of the Constitution. This step will be taken simply to meet a difficulty that was predicted when that extraordinary section was fixed up. It is to be regretted that it should be necessary, so early in the history of the Commonwealth, to meet it, but since it has arisen it is satisfactory to know that the Government are prepared to deal with it. I am likewise glad to learn that they propose to bring forward a Bill relating to the payment of income tax by. Federal public servants. The introduction of that measure will, at all events, show the public, who have hitherto completely misunderstood the position, that in fighting the income tax claims made by some of the States the Government have been seeking, as they were in duty bound to do, to establish great constitutional principles, and not to create a privileged class in the community. I am glad to learn that the </para>

                <para class="block">Ministry propose to ta%e over from the States some of the other Departments which the Constitution empowers them to administer, and that they intend to ask us to legislate with respect .to some of the other powers which the Constitution vests in the Federation. The time has arrived when we should take over all the Departments that the Constitution authorizes the Federation to administer, and fully exercise our legislative powers. By so doing, the Government will bring the people, at every turn, into closer touch with the Federation. They will accustom them to the' legislation of the Commonwealth Parliament, and give them an opportunity to realize the benefit of securing uniform legislation throughout Australia. The great subject for our consideration this session will undoubtedly be the Tariff. It was upon that question that the last general election turned, and I trust that when this great work is submitted to us we shall approach it in a business-like way. We should endeavour to deal with it as quickly as possible, not merely for our own satisfaction, but for the sake of those engaged in commercial pursuits, who desire to know exactly what the Tariff is to be. I also hope that when we frame the Tariff we will show the people that the policy of Australia is that of effective protection, and that there is no intention to depart from it. If we adopt that course those who desire to invest their money in manufactures will be able to do so with some certainty. At the same time we should let it be clearly understood1 that we are not actuated by a desire to enable a few men - either individuals or corporations - to amass a great deal of wealth or to give an opportunity to that extraordinary class of human beings, that may be called commercial philanthropists, who seem to be eager to establish manufactures and carry them on at a loss for the sake of providing some of their less fortunate fellow human beings with a bare livelihood. </para>

                        <para>- According to sworn evidence there are such persons, but I for one very much doubt evidence showing that people are investing their money in manufactures and carrying on at a loss. My object - and I believe it is the object of all protectionists - in supporting the policy of protection has always been to secure the establishment of industries that will afford our people an opportunity for employment, and open up to those who may be attracted to our shores fresh avenues of occupation on such terms that they as white people may be able to live in comfort and decency. The most prosperous community is that which, has a large amount of capital in circulation, and I know of no means of securing a better circulation of money than that afforded by a large well paid wage-earning population. It is unfortunate that there should have been omitted from the Constitution a provision enabling this Parliament to frame factory and other industrial legislation since it has the sole right to impose duties of Customs and Excise. I hope that the States Parliaments will yet recognise that it is absolutely necessary that the Parliament which imposes the Customs and Excise taxation should also be able to determine the conditions under which factories established under the Tariff shall be carried on. We can, of course, do a little in that direction, and I sincerely trust that thf; House will do its utmost to insure that employes are benefited by the industries established in the Commonwealth. Many other subjects are dealt with in the speech delivered by  His Excellency  the Governor-General. Reference is made in it to the taking over of the Northern Territory, to defence questions, and to the desirableness of encouraging immigration, as well as to various other matters ; but, to discuss them now would be only to diminish the probability of our being able to deal effectively with them at a later stage. </para>

                        <para>- I can only hope that in dealing with the various matters submitted to us during the session we shall endeavour, as far as possible, to curtail our remarks. We have before us a very heavy session - one which doubtless in the most favorable circumstances will not close before the end of the year, and my own opinion is that we shall do well not to exercise more than is absolutely necessary our capacity for speech-making. In the interests of the Commonwealth generally, and particularly of those honorable members who reside in distant States, the sessions of the Federal Parliament should not at the outside extend over more than four or five months. I can assure the House that I, for one, shall not be given to the making of long speeches, but will do mv utmost to keep the sessions within reasonable bounds, so that the representatives of the people who live further from the Seat of Government than I do may have an opportunity to return to their homes and their businesses in something like reasonable time. </para>

                        <para>- I happen to represent the most democratic constituency in the Commonwealth, a constituency which, at the same time, contains the largest number of factories. On behalf of the workers and electors of Batman I express trie hope that the Prime Minister may be long spared to occupy his present 'high and honorable position, and with his name I couple that of the Minister of Trade and Customs. The first business we shall be called upon to deal with is that of Tariff reform. This is a most important and serious question and one which affects not only the constituency represented by myself, but also that represented by the honorable member for Yarra. Here I desire to say that I regret the absence of the right honorable and learned member for Adelaide, who was the framer of the first Federal Tariff, and who performed a very difficult task as well as was possible under the circumstances. I am sure we all regret that the state of health of the right honorable member is not such as we could wish; and I may say that on every occasion when I mentioned his name during my election campaign it was received with rounds of " applause. Honorable members will agree with me that the Tariff does need reforming. What is the position to-day? In boots alone- we import something like ,£373,000 worth each year ; and I venture to say that every pair could have been made within the bounds of the Commonwealth. Further, every hat that is imported could be made here; and on the free list of the Tariff there  aTe  other articles which could be produced within Australia. If I may be permitted I should like to give one illustration. A few months ago the Collingwood </para>

                <para class="block">City Council required a steam roller; which, it was stated, could not be made in Australia. But what is the fact? Today the steam roller is being made in the Commonwealth ; and on the authority of the sworn evidence taken before the Tariff Commission I can say that every piece of machinery now being imported could be manufactured within our own borders. I trust that the Tariff will be revised in such a direction that the manufactured articles we require will be produced by our own workers. I shall be prepared to vote for protection in connexion with Tariff reform ; but the people who receive the protection must be prepared to give their workers a fair share of the benefit. I do not intend to detain honorable members with a long speech, but I should like to refer to the proposed amendment of the Electoral Act. This is a most important matter; and in my opinion the Act should be amended at the earliest possible moment. There is also the question of preferential voting. I am a believer in majority rule, and, therefore, I hail with satisfaction the announcement that there is to be introduced a Bill which I understand will give the majority of the people in a constituency the power to say who their representative shall be. Another measure which, I understand, is to be introduced, is one by the Postmaster-General respecting penny postage. We have very important duties to perform ; and I trust that during the coming session we shall view the various questions put before us, not merely from a party stand-point, but from a national stand-point. I have the honour to represent a State which has always viewed questions from a national stand-point ; and I trust that we may so acquit ourselves that when the time comes for us to face our judges again, they will be able to say, " Well done, thou good and faithful servants." </para>
