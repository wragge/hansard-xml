                                <para>- The departmental officers cannot say what will be the effect of reducing the duty from 6s. in bottle and 8s. in bulk to 3s. 6d., but the probability is that there will be a greater consumption of these beverages because they will be cheaper. The spirit adulterated with kerosene which is sold by druggists is sometimes consumed by persons who are fond of strong drink. Kerosene is mixed with it to give it a disagreeable taste and smell to prevent its consumption, but I have known persons to drink white spirit so adulterated, and, on one occasion, I was told by a druggist, in reference to a woman who had come into his shqp to buy a bottle of this spirit for 3d. or 6d. that that was the sixth time that she had come in that day. She was a member of a travelling show company. In my opinion, the consumption of these beverages will be greatly increased if the duty is reduced. </para>

One of the beverages included in the item is a drink largely used by Japanese and Chinese, ajnd surely we are not going to reduce duties to make their drinks cheaper while increasing duties to make European drinks dearer? Unless  I  hear better reasons for the proposed reduction, I shall move to make the duty 6s. That will get rid of any confusion which may have existed by having the two rates of 6s. and 8s. </para>

                            <para>.- While I welcome the departmental proposal to reduce a duty, I must point out that both sections of the Tariff Commission reported in favour of the old rates, which were 6s. in bottle and 8s. in . bulk where the alcoholic strength did not exceed 35 per cent. ; 8s. ffd. and 10s. 6d. where it did not exceed 40 per cent. ; and 14s. where it exceeded 40 per cent. The new rates, are 3s. 6d. per gallon -where the alcoholic strength does not exceed 25 per cent. ; 7s. per gallon where it does not exceed 50 per cent. ; and 14s. per gallon where it exceeds 50 per cent, of proof spirit. This seems an extraordinary alteration, and I see no reason for it. Twenty-five per cent, of proof spirit must be a fairly strong drink, and the proposal that it should be admitted at a duty of 3s. 6d. per gallon is a very novel one.&#39; There is no object to be gained by this alteration. Why should, we depart from the old rates, which have been confirmed by both sections of the Tariff Commission? If an honorable member would move that the duty of 3s. 6d. per gallon be left out, with a view to insert the old rates of 6s. and <inline font-style="italic">8s. per</inline> gallon, I should be disposed to support it. </para>

                            <para>.- I think that the Government are making a! mistake. The alteration may have been proposed to suit the convenience of the officers of the Department, but it occurs to me that1 they are in error in anticipating that it will have no detrimental effect on the revenue. A liquor containing 24 per cent, of alcohol is as strong as any one need desire. If we allow Japanese sake to come in at the rate proposed, many tipplers, who desire quantity for their money, may resort to its use, and thus there may be a considerable run upon it, leading to grave destruction of the revenue. I think we should act wisely in adhering to the old rate. </para>

If the right honorable member can imagine the taste of a glass of sherry diluted with exhausted soda water, he will be able to form some idea of its flavour.

                                <para>- Every one admits that he thoroughly understands his work, and &#34;the Government have decided to &#39;follow his recommendation. I have had it typewritten, so that the intricacies of the question may be clearly put before honorable members. I shall read these proposals very slowly, and if honorable members, whilst following me, refer to the Tariff they will be able to tell in a moment what amendments are contemplated. I shall also describe what will be the result of the proposed alterations. I do not think that we can deal with this division apart from the Excise duties relating to it, and I propose, therefore, to move the postponement of the remaining, import duties, in order that we may reach the Excise schedule on the last page of the Tariff, and deal concurrently with the Customs and Excise duties on tobacco and manufactures thereof. </para>

                                <para>- Whilst the Government are in full sympathy with the desire of the Tariff Commission to afford the fullest encouragement to the growth and use of Australian-grown leaf - and honorable members will find that the division, as it stands, follows the recommendations of one section of the Commission - an examination of the recommendations of the Commission will, I am confident, clearly demonstrate that, if they are given effect to, their intentions cannot possibly be realized. That is proved by the objections raised by those interested in the industry, as well as by experts, to the Tariff as introduced. It may be readily shown by taking the recommendations in order, and examining the protective incidence which would result in each case. A slight modification, however, &#39; may be made which will amply provide for what is so much desired. Take item 17, the first in this division. The proposal of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission is that the duty on that item, &#34;Tobacco, manufactured,&#34; shall be 3s. 6d. per lb. If we turn to the Excise, to fully understand the position, we must compare this with the rates proposed on unmanufactured leaf to be manufactured into tobacco and the Excise duty to be paid on such manufacture. We find on turning to item 21 that the recommendation is unstemmed leaf, is. 9d. per lb. ; stemmed or in strips&#39;, 2s. per lb. ; and the Excise on manufactured is. 3d. per lb., as it was anticipated that the cost of stemming would be 3d. per lb. That is a point of which I had previously no knowledge; but it is estimated very generally that stemming would cost what I have mentioned. The duty on the leaf would therefore be equivalent in either case to 2s. per lb. on that assumption. This affords a protection to the manufacture of tobacco from imported leaf of 3d. only, as compared with 9d. under the 1902 Tariff. It is clear that a margin of 3d. per lb. when the cheaper labour conditions of. the United States are taken into consideration- </para>

                                <para>- Yes. It is clear that a margin of 3d. per lb. when the cheaper labour conditions of the United States are taken into consideration is altogether insufficient to compete with the imported tobacco, and the inevitable result will be - if this proposal be adhered to - that the importation of manufactured tobacco will very largely increase, and the manufactories here will be seriously affected. I wish to draw special attention to the fact that whilst we are prepared to spare no effort to encourage the use of the local leaf, we recognise that important aid to its encouragement and existence will be found in well-equipped factories in Australia, and we must be careful in seeing that whilst they are not permitted in the slightest degree to discriminate unfavorably against &#39; any local interest, their existence is not imperilled. I have been in close consultation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill,</inline> the tobacco expert of Queensland, whose recommendations I think the Tariff Commission intended to follow. I have his assurance that he intended the Commission to draw from his evidence the conclusions which I am putting before the Committee at the present moment, but that his statements were misinterpreted - not intentionally, of course- and therein the trouble appears to have arisen. He has suggested to the Government that whilst the duty on imported manufactured tobacco might properly be fixed at 3s. 6d. per lb., the duty on imported leaf for local manufacture should be rated at <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> unstemmed, is. 6d. per lb., <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> stemmed, 2s. per lb., with an excise of is. per lb. </para>

                                <para>- There is some proposal in reference to that matter. I come now to item  18,  &#34;Tobacco, cut, n.e.i.&#34; In this connexion the Government propose a duty of  3s.  od. per lb. The Tariff Commission made no recommendation in this respect, but it is thought that it is proper to encourage the cutting to be undertaken in Australia, and the extra  3d.  per lb. will probably do a great deal to bring about that result. That is the reason for the increase. </para>

                                <para>- This is a very intricate subject, and I prefer to accept the ideas of an expert - who must understand a great deal more about it than a layman - to those of a non-expert. With regard to item  19,  &#34; Tobacco, cut fine for cigarettes, per lb.  6s 6d.&#34; <inline font-style="italic">,</inline> I wish to say that this also is a proposal by the Government. It has been introduced with the idea of protecting the cigarette industry, but experience has already .shown that it is extremely difficult to distinguish what may properly be termed cigarette tobacco from what may not. There is a very large consumption of light, fine cut tobacco for pipe smoking, and it is therefore proposed to strike out this item. It will then be included under  18,  in respect of which a duty of  3s. 9d.  per lb. is imposed. </para>

                                <para>- The reason a duty of  4s.  per lb. has been imposed upon it is that the tobacco is of a superior quality. Item  23,  &#34; Tobacco destroyed for manufacture of sheep wash, or other purposes under departmental by-laws,&#34; will be admitted free. Tn regard to item  24,  &#34; Cigars, including the weight of bands and ribbons, per lb.,  6s. 3d.,  and <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> 15  per cent.&#34;, it is suggested that that duty shall be retained. Upon all importations it averages roughly about  7s. 4d.  per lb. The Government propose that the imported&#39; leaf used for the manufacture of cigars shall be charged <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> unstemmed,  3s.  per lb., and <inline font-style="italic">(b),</inline> stemmed, or in strips,&#39;  3s. 3d.  per lb., which - after taking into consideration the cost of stemming - it is thought will work out at  3s. 3d.  per lb. If we add to this the proposed Excise of (s), machine-made, is. per lb. ;(b), hand-made, 6d. per lb., we shall find that the preference on cigars made locally from imported leaf is, on machine-made, 3s. ifl. per lb., and on hand-made, 3s. 7d. per lb., as against 4s. 4d. per lb. under the 1902 Tairiff. </para>

                                <para>- I shall refer to that point presently. The Government now propose, on the recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill,</inline> to substitute for the composite duty - that is, the 15 per cent, ad valorem, and the specific duty of 6s. 3d. per lb. - a specific duty of 7s. 6d. per lb. The Government propose that there should be no discrimination between machine-made and hand-made cigars; that imported unstemmed leaf for the manufacture of cigars should be rated at 2s. 6d. per lb., and stemmed leaf at 3s. per lb., with the Excise fixed at 6d. per lb. That will afford a protection to the local manufacture from imported leaf over imported cigars of 4s. 3d. per lb., and a protection . to the manufacture of cigars from local leaf of 7s. per lb. </para>

                                <para>- That is a question for the Committee, but the expert thinks it is enough. In regard to the alteration from an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> to a fixed rate of duty, I may point out that the composite duty has little advantage or effect in protecting our local manufacturers from the large quantities of cheaply made cigars which inundate this market, and for that reason the fixed rate is preferable. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> explained to me the estimated cost of those cheap imported cigars, and I shall deal with that matter later on. The discrimination suggested in favour of hand-made cigars is one which, if given effect to, will certainly not have the result desired. . We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the machine-made cigars of other countries, where cheap labour is employed are the chief competitors of our industry. To penalize the manufacture of machine-made cigars in Australia, simply encourages a transfer of the industry, and will undoubtedly increase importations. </para>

                                <para>- Here we have a difference of opinion at once; and, therefore, I think it wise to let honorable members know what is said by the Commission. In regard to cigarettes, no alteration is proposed in the import duty, but it is proposed to vary very slightly the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Commission in regard to the rates on imported manufactured tobacco for the making of cigarettes as set out in item 21. We propose a duty of 1s. 6d. per lb. on unstemmed tobacco, and of 2s. per lb. on stemmed tobacco, with an Excise of 2s. 9d. This gives a preference&#39; to the manufacturer of cigarettes from imported leaf, over imported cigarettes, of is. 9d. per lb., when the leaf is stemmed, and, when the leaf is unstemmed, a preference of 2s. per lb. The protection to cigarettes made wholly from locally-grown leaf, as compared with imported . manufactured cigarettes, will, according to our proposals, be 3s. 9d. I may add that a very important feature of the proposals of -the Tariff Commission was the discrimination between imported stemmed and unstemmed leaf ; and this has the &#39; fullest sympathy of the Government. But we consider that the difference of only 3d. per lb. will not sufficiently compensate for the cheaper labour available elsewhere, and we have widened the margin to 6d. j in other words, we have reduced the&#39; import dutv on unstemmed leaf to is. 6d., as compared with the duty of is. 9d. recommended by the Tariff Commission. We desire to insure success in this direction, since, according to our present importations, it is estimated that employment will be provided for 600 additional hands. We must also keep in view the fact that the present demand for tobacco reaches about 12,000,000 lbs. ; which we can meet at the present time by a local supply in favorable seasons, of only about 2,500,000 lbs. or 3,000,000 lbs. </para>

The rates now proposed by the Government are, we consider, more&#39; advantageous to the grower and manufacturer, than those proposed by the Tariff Commission,  and much in advance of the 1902 Tariff. In  saying  this I do not wish for one moment to imply that the Tariff Commission did not exercise, as far as they could, the greatest discretion, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> says that his evidence was entirely misunderstood by the Commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> believes that to be the reason why the Commission made their recommendation- that the recommendation was not from any desire to handicap local manufacturers, in the way their proposal seems to be doing at present.- </para>

On tobacco locally manufactured from imported stemmed leaf there will&#39; be a levy by the Government of 3s., as against an import duty .of 3s. 6d ; in other words, the difference and, therefore, the protection, will be 6d. The duty on stemmed tobacco is to be 2s. ; and honorable members will immediately see that the Treasurer again departs from the line prescribed by his figures. The honorable gentleman said that the cost of stemming is 3d., but he makes a difference of 6d. ; and I fall back om my primary statement that what he is doing is to give greater protection than was originally proposed to local stemming, and, by a consequence, to local leaf. That conclusion has been arrived at on the advice of an expert, who in the last few months has changed his opinion. </para>

                        <para class="block">I prefer to think that the expert has changed, his opinion, and that, possibly, the Ministry have helped him to do so. I suggest - and I intend to test the question - that we should revert to the rates established in 1901-2, which have worked very well. Of course, while willing to consider the interests of importers and of local manufacturers, in view of the quantity of tobacco consumed in Australia, we must, in the interests of the general public, pay some attention&#39; to revenue, price, and quality. There is a very large public interested in the question of quality and price. Surely then we are not going to give too much encouragement to the local manufacturers who, according to the report of the Royal Commission of 1906, are almost all in combination, so that they have at least a partial monopoly. We are surely not going to give too much encouragement to local growers at the expense of the consuming public, with whom the first consideration is quality. I suggest that, for various reasons, we should go back to the position of 1901 and 1902. When the Tariff was introduced in 1 901, an import duty of 3s. 6d. was proposed, but after a long debate it was determined that a rale of 3s. 3d. would be sufficient. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad that the honorable member has reminded me of that. He took a great interest in this and other questions affected by the Tariff. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner said publicly at one stage of the debate that, although his proposition allowed a difference of is. in favour of the local manufacturers, he was prepared, after full consideration of all the circumstances, to regard a preference of 9d. as adequate, and to that Parliament agreed. But the rates proposed by the unaltered resolutions are an import duty of 351. 6d. on manufactured tobacco, and of 2S- on stemmed leaf, with an Excise duty of is. 3d. on locally manufactured tobacco, giving a protection to the local manufacturer of only 3d. instead of the former protection of 9&#60;J. On tobacco made from imported unstemmed leaf the protection will be 6d., the import duty on unstemmed leaf being only is. 9d. The adoption of these rates suggests that it was considered that the cost of stemming is equal to 3d., but now the Government is departing from what was a symmetrical arrangement, making the difference between the import duty oil stemmed leaf and that &#39;on unstemmed leaf 6d. </para>

I believe that that was done, but according to the memorandum to which I have referred, the preference has been reduced from 3d. to <inline font-style="italic">id.,</inline> because, I suppose, although it provided a certain amount of employment, it had an injurious effect on the revenue, or on the price or quality of the tobacco produced. </para>

Under the New South Wales Tariff the preference given to the local manufacturer was od., under the South Australian Tariff is.. 2d., under the Victorian Tariff is. 3d., and under the Queensland Tariff something like 3s., where local leaf was used. But in 1901 this Parliament, after a long debate, and a full consideration of all the circumstances, agreed as a compromise to fix the preference at 9d. On the whole that has been a success. </para>

                                <para>- The Committee rejected that proposal with the approval, of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, who was then Treasurer, and who, after submitting it, made a further investigation of the facts. How has the revenue been affected? In 1902 the Excise from tobacco was .&#163;453,171, and in 1907 it rose to &#163;688,000 so that the revenue, tested by the Excise, has benefited. I do not know what has been the increased revenue derived from the Customs duties on tobacco, but I have some figures relating to narcotics, which I shall put before the Committee. They show that the Customs duties collections in respect of narcotics in 1902 were &#163;917,090; and in 1907, &#163;991,000, so that the preference of <inline font-style="italic">gd.,</inline> if we take as the test its effect upon the revenue, has been fairly successful. The increase in the Customs collections has been more than in proportion to the increase in population. This is an important matter, because the week before last the Treasurer, when concluding one of the three general discussions on the Tariff, two of which he had induced, stated that if the annual revenue of &#163;10,500,000 which he estimated to derive from the Tariff were reduced within two years, as suggested by the honorable member for Flinders, to about &#163;9,000,000, he would not be able to pay to the States the full three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they were entitled under the Constitution, and at .the same time meet the expenditure provided for this year. In such a contingency, he said that he  would  have a shortage of something like &#163;272,000. In these circumstances, we must be careful what we do in regard to any sacrifice of revenue. We ought not to tamper with the difference of <inline font-style="italic">gd.</inline> which,, up to&#39; the present, from the point of view of protectionists and revenue  Tariffists,  appears to have worked fairly well. There is another aspect of this question to which I shall refer. Even under the old Tariff the local leaf has not fared badly, and it does not require any further protection. If we make a difference of 6d. per lb. between the duty on stemmed and unstemmed leaf, we shall affect the quality, since the manufacturers, who ought to know something about the question, have indicated their preference for stemmed as against unstemmed leaf, and may diminish importation. If, by differentiating between the stemmed and unstemmed leaf, we give the . local leaf an advantage, not merely of 6d. per lb.,, but a preference to  be measured by the difference between the Excise duty of is. per lb. and the total import duty, there will either be an increase in the price of tobacco, if the raw material be imported, or a diminution in the quality if the local leaf, as at -present grown, be used. Thus, the consumer must be affected. Under the Tariff which was passed in 1901-2, a great increase has taken place in the consumption of imported leaf. I refer &#34;to this fact, merely as indicating the preference exhibited by the manufacturers, who ought to know what is the best leaf to use.  Lt  1899&#39;, the consumption of the local leaf in New South Wales was 1,243,580 lbs., whilst in 1906 it was only 692,282 lbs. The consumption of imported leaf, on the other hand, increased from 1,167,417 lbs. in 1899 to- 2,527,358 lbs. in 1906. In Victoria 1,271,556 lbs. of imported leaf were used in 1899, whereas in 1906, no less than 4,172,065 lbs. were used. Then, again, in South Australia, 237,172 lbs. of imported leaf were used in 1902, whilst in 1906 241,897 lbs. were used. The consumption of the local leaf in South Australia and Victoria also increased during -the same period, but not in anything like the same proportion. If these figures point to anything, it -is to the fact that the manufacturers prefer the imported leaf for their purposes. At the same time, the protection granted to the local manufacturer under the old Tariff must have been sufficient, since there has been a shrinkage in the importation of manufactured tobacco. In these circumstances, I propose that we should revert to the old preference of 9d. per lb. I was told by a representative deputation of the workers, as well as of the manufacturers, which waited upon me, that it is almost impossible to force on the market manufactures of local leaf. </para>

                                <para>- The figures were submitted to me, showing that tobacco containing 75 per cent, of imported leaf was selling at 4s. 6d. per lb., whilst tobacco made solely of local leaf  Wa.s&#39;  realizing only 2s. rod- per lb. I do not wish to prolong the discussion, but I think it would be a mistake to depart from the Tariff of 1901-2, which was settled after a long discussion, which has worked well from the point of view of revenue, and has also led to a diminution in the &#39;importation of manufactured tobacco. To test the feeling of the Committee, I shall move that the duty of 3s. 6d. be reduced to 3s. 3d.,, and, later on, it will be necessary for me to move that the duty upon stemmed and unstemmed imported  tobacco be is. 6d. per lb. If the Excise be kept at is. per lb., there will then be a protection of 9d. per lb. I move - </para>

                            <para>.- I understand that the amendments suggested by the Government will have the effect of meeting the wishes of those engaged in the tobacco industry, inasmuch as they will result in a preference of practically 9d. in the pound to the local manufacturer. The old Tariff,&#39; so far as these items are concerned, was satisfactory, and therefore it seems to be unnecessary to increase the duty. The question received careful consideration at our hands in  19c2.  I remember a speech then made by the deputy leader of the Opposition, who dilated upon the profits of the manufacturers, and produced a balance-sheet -showing that Messrs. Cameron Brothers, tobacco manufacturers, had made an enormous profit on a twelve-months&#39; turnover.  S01  startling were the figures submitted by the honorable member, that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, who was then Treasurer, asked the Committee to agree to the postponement of the item in order that he might make further inquiries. When we met again, four days later, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner made a statement to the effect that, notwithstanding that he had appealed to the manufacturers to assist him to deal with the statement that had been made as to the profits which they were securing, he had to admit that the position was unsatisfactory. So unsatisfactory were the answers received from the manufacturers that he asked the Committee to reduce the duty by 3d. per lb. </para>

                                <para>- The figures produced by those interested in the industry show that under the old Tariff there has been a considerable falling off in our imports of manufactured tobacco - a falling off of nearly  1,000,000  lbs. per annum. It is evident, therefore, that the protection which has hitherto been accorded to the industry has (been fairly substantial. I would further point out that the persons who are directly interested in this industry merely ask for a margin of ad. per lb. in their own favour. They have, not made any request for an increased duty. They are perfectly satisfied to be placed in the position which they occupied under the 1902 Tariff. Their view is indorsed in a circular that I have received from the Federated Tobacco Workers, which reads - </para>

This margin was adopted in the old federal Tariff, and worked well in the past.

                            <para>.- As the Treasurer remarked in introducing these proposals, &#34;this subject is a very complicated, one. I am not sure at the present moment that I have fully grasped the precise import of the changes in the rates of duty which the Government propose. It would, have been a great advantage to honorable members if the Government had submitted their new proposals .in a tabulated form alongside of the proposals embodied in the printed Tariff schedule. Then we should have been able to get a better grip of the subject than we can hope to do by discussing a mass of figures which have been orally presented to us. I do not intend to discuss the new proposals in detail, but&#39; I desire to inform the Committee of the methods by which the Tariff Commission arrived at their conclusions. We had four aspects of this question to consider. In the first place, we had to consider the question&#39; of developing the cultivation of tobacco in Australia; in the second, we had to think of the position of the manufacturer ; in the third, we had to have regard to the interests of the workers ; and, finally, we had l.oguard against the consumer being called upon to pay an unduly high price for his smoke. Unfortunately, it happens that all&#39; these interests are more or less opposed to one another. We found, therefore, that the question was a peculiarly difficult one. Indeed, no subject which came under the consideration of the Commission was dealt with at greater length or discussed with more anxiety than &#39;the incidence of the duties upon tobacco. .We heard the evidence of the Queensland expert, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill,</inline> in connexion with the growth of tobacco, particularly in that State, and all&#39; the members of the Commission were very much impressed with his testimony. He gave us proof positive that Queensland was turning out an excellent quality of tobacco- - a tobacco which was sampled by the most uncompromising free-trader on the Commission, who readily admitted that from the stand-point of quality it was equal to anything that he had ever smoked. We also took evidence in other parts of the Commonwealth that tobacco could be grown to advantage there, and I think that all the members of the Commission came to the conclusion that the cultivation of tobacco ought to be an Australian industry, and one which - with a fair amount of encouragement - would undoubtedly become one of the most important in our midst. At any rate, that is my own opinion. I believe that Australia has such a variety of soil and climate suited to the growth of particular varieties of tobacco as would enable us, within a few years, to become independent of the outside world in regard to our consumption of that article. That being the opinion which was arrived at by a majority of the Commission, we had to give considerable weight to the value of such evidence in framing our recommendations. It seems to me that the new proposals of the Government, to a large extent, ignore the interests of the growers of tobacco, and also, the possibilities of developing the cultivation of that commodity, in favour of the interests of the manufacturer. </para>

                                <para>- I have the figures correctly. While I am prepared to adopt some modification of the Commission&#39;s proposals, it is impossible for me to go so far as the Government have indicated a desire to take the Committee. I am aware that men in the tobacco industry have been thrown out of work, but I hold the opinion that that is not the direct result of the Tariff. The fat monopoly which controls the manufacture of tobacco in Australia has thrown those men out of work for no other reason, I believe, than to emphasize the requests that have been made for better consideration than has been given to the monopoly in the recommendations of the Tariff Commission as adopted by the Government. </para>

                                <para>- The men themselves are, unfortunately, in the hands of their employers, and when they are thrown out of work it is very natural for them to come to the conclusion that the Tariff is responsible. The Tariff Commission took up the position - and I believe I am now quoting the opinion of all the members - that in this connexion revenue is an important consideration, and that under the old Tariff nearly&#163;1,000,000, which ought to have gone into the Treasury, went into the pockets of the manufacturers. The Commission modified the old duties with a view to overtake that loss of revenue, and further provided that if the manufacturers developed the growth of Australian tobacco, and used it, they would, instead of losing by the increased Excise, gain something. However, I am of opinion that the manufacturers do not wish to use the locally-produced article, and thus encourage production, for the reason that while the bulk &#39; is imported they can control the importation, whereas if the bulk be locally grown their monopoly will cease to exist, because then small manufacturers, who now have to buy their supplies from the combination, will be able to compete. </para>

                                <para>- The free-trade section of the Commission had that revenue in view there ; and their recommendation is, I contend, sufficient discrimination in favour of &#39;the use of the local article. I am quite at a loss to understand why the Government propose to give a discrimination of 6d. in regard to unstemmed leaf, when 3d. is supposed to be sufficient. Here, again, it appears to me that the Government are going out of their way to confer another privilege &#39;on the manufacturers who wish to import their leaf. As to the abolition of the difference recommended by the Tariff Commission,, as between hand-made and machine-made cigars, I am utterly at a loss to understand the Government proposal. In the first place, the machines are, I believe, a monopoly of the Combine; but I understand that machines&#39; turn out an inferior cigar - that the machine-made cigar is not at all equal in smokable qualities to the hand-made cigar. I am not awaire, however, that any considerable quantity of machine-made cigars enters the Commonwealth, most of the Manilla and Havana cigars. being made by hand. Machine-made cigars may be. capable of improvement; but what I have described is, I believe, the present state of affairs ; and the concession by the Government to the -monopolist is one </para>

                        <para class="block">I must absolutely oppose. It appears to me that what the Tariff Commission had to decide was whether they would consider the interests of the manufacturers or the interests of the growers. The consumer, I take it, under either the old or the new proposals, will not be particularly affected ; but it is the duty of the Government, and of protectionists here, not to think of particular manufacturing industries in which they may have a local interest, but to consider the larger question of the development of the cultivation of tobacco, which, 1 believe, ought, in the estimation of protectionists, to be of national importance. </para>

At any rate, I contend that the recommendations of the Commission give ample protection to the grower of tobacco, that they give a. reasonable amount of revenue, and, at the same time, enable the manufacturer who desires to use al proportion of Australian leaf to make a fair and reasonable profit, without unduly plundering the smoking section of the community. </para>

                                <para>- Nothing like that. Under the present proposals of the Government, the Excise on Australian-grown leaf is is., and that is the only impost which local leaf is called upon to bear. The duty on the manufactured article is proposed a.t 3s. 6d., which gives protection to the extent of 2s. 6d. in favour of the Australian leaf. The B section of the Tariff Commission, on the other hand, proposed an Excise of is. 6d. on locally-grown leaf as against a duty of 3s. 3d., which left a difference of only is. od. </para>

                                <para>- That is another point. .Now let us turn to tobacco made from imported leaf, and observe the difference between the recommendations of the B section of the Tariff Commission and the Government proposals. On imported leaf the Government propose a duty of 2s. in the case of stemmed leaf, and of is. 6d. in the case of unstemmed leaf. We may take the duty as 2s., because the cost of stemming has been put at 4d. or  4 1/2d. </para>

                                    who is an expert, states that the cost of stemming is 4d. or 4jd., leaving only a balance of 1 1/2d.,  so that, for my present purposes, we may take the duty on imported leaf at 2s., which, with the Excise of - is., makes a total of 3s. The duty on the manufactured article is 3s. 6d., showing a protection of 6d. This duty will really amount to a little more, because, in the case of unstemmed leaf, the stemming will cost not quite 6d.

                                <para>- The B section of the Tariff Commission proposed an Excise duty of is. 6d., and an import duty of 2s. on stemmed leaf, and of is. <inline font-style="italic">gd.</inline> on, unstemmed leaf, thus making the charges on tobacco manufactured from imported&#39; stemmed leaf 3s. 6d., while at the same time they recommended that manufactured&#39; tobacco should be admitted on payment of a duty of 3s. 3d. Therefore, they proposed to offer a preference of 3d. to the foreigner. Surely that is foreign trade run mad. </para>

                                <para>- Whatever may be said for the encouragement of the growing of leaf in Australia, nothing can be gained for the Australian industry by giving the foreign manufacturer an advantage of 3d. per lb. If these recommendations were adopted, the manufacture of tobacco in Australia from imported leaf would come to an end. I do not think that that is intended. But it seems to me that the members who made these recommendations did not give as much consideration as they should have given, to the inevitable effects of their proposals. The Government is giving a decided preference to the local grower, who, under its proposals, will have a greater advantage than he had previously - and he has always had a very good margin, there having been always a large difference in favour of tobacco manufactured from local leaf. </para>

                                <para>- The quality of the tobacco produced would depend upon the managers and workmen employed. I admit that an attempt is being made to increase the encouragement offered for the use of locally-grown leaf, and that under present conditions it is possible that a great deal of the profit will go into the pockets of the Combine, which can regulate as it likes the prices paid to the growers for leaf. </para>

                                <para>- We desire, in the first instance, to make the tobacco industry a profitable one to both growers and manufacturers. The alternative to doing so is to say that, until the tobacco industry is nationalized, no protection will be given to the local grower, which, to my mind, would be like cutting off one&#39;s nose to spite his face. We had better give all the encouragement we can to the use of locally-grown leaf, and keep pegging away to secure the nationalization of the manufacturing of tobacco. I wish to draw attention to the fact that no differentiation has been made in favour of strand or twist tobacco, which is manufactured by hand, and into whose composition consequently only long fine leaves can enter. Plug tobacco, on the other hand, is machine made, and I have heard it said that floor sweepings and uncleanly refuse are sometimes used, though I do- not say that that is so. </para>

                                <para>-Refuse may be. used in some cases. Any scrap tobacco can be used for the making of plugs, in which are pressed together all sorts of pieces. On one occasion I found a whole stocking squeezed into a plug of Victory, and these plugs, as honorable members know, are not very large. I took it back to  Ambruster&#39;s  in Adelaide, from whom I had bought the tobacco, and I mention the incident only to show that great pressure is used in the making of plugs, and that almost any kind of tobacco could be squeezed into them. Of course, plug tobacco may be made of the best materials, but, on the other hand, it is quite possible to make it of fillings. </para>

                                <para>- That has often happened. In such cases I think that floor sweepings must be used. But as only long leaf can be used for the making of strand or twist tobacco, sweepings and refuse which may contain noxious germs cannot find their way into its composition. In order to put twist tobacco on an equal footing with plug tobacco, there should be a differentiation of 3d. per &#39; lb. in its favour, and the Excise should be <inline font-style="italic">gd.</inline> instead of is. per lb. I do not know whether the healthy considerations which suggest a preference to hand-made tobacco apply also to the hand-made as against -.machine-made cigars. An attempt is being made to secure differentiation in favour of hand-made cigars, since it is not open to any man to obtain a cigar-making machine. As a matter of fact, only those who are in the Combine, or are recognised in some way by it, can obtain these machines, but it is open to any one to enter upon the work of making cigars by hand, and I think we shall be justified in differentiating between the two classes. The reasons for differentiating between twist or strand tobacco and plug tobacco are obvious. No refuse can be used in twist tobacco, and those who manufacture it are therefore at a disadvantage in competing with makers of plug tobacco. </para>

This agitation has led to the popularity of twist tobacco in that State, although manufacturers of plug tobacco are doing their utmost to push it out of the market. Since the introduction of the present Tariff, the price of twist tobacco in South Australia has been raised by id. per twist, whereas the price of plug tobacco, so far as I am aware, has not been increased. When a combine obtains control of the industry, it can raise the price of the twist tobacco and lower the price of the plug tobacco, and so knock out the superior article, which costs more. to. produce. This differentiation of 3d. per lb. would prevent such attempts, and would meet the desire of a great many people to be supplied with twist tobacco at a reasonable price. </para>

I think that the amendments proposed by the Government, from the point of view of the local grower of tobacco leaf, are an improvement on their original proposition, and on the whole I am prepared to support them, r do not think that an additional impost of 3d. per lb. on the manufactured article would tend to prohibit its use, or seriously affect the revenue. </para>

The encouragement given to the local manufacturer should certainly go hand in hand with that given to the local producer of the leaf ; but the first desideratum to be aimed at in this connexion is to give the largest degree of support to the locally-grown leaf. After a number of consultations with

                            the Queensland tobacco expert - than whom there is no better authority in the Commonwealth - I have arrived at the conclusion that the proposals .now put forward by the Government in substitution of the items in the schedule as originally submitted are eminently calculated to achieve that object. I represented, for many years in the State Parliament of Queensland a district the staple product of which is tobacco, and there is no reason why other districts should not be able to produce large quantities. The chief considerations are suitability of soil and climate, and I feel confident that, there are many other parts of the Commonwealth where the climate and soil are equal to those of the Texas district, to which I have referred.

                            - I am obliged to the honorable member. In Queensland the import duty on manufactured tobacco was 4s. per lb., whilst the import duty on the unmanufactured leaf was 2s. per lb. There was an Excise duty of is. per lb., so that there was thus a differentiation of is. per lb. In New South Wales there was a differentiation of only 9d. per lb., but that difference had this effect: that whilst the whole of the alluvial flats along the northern or Queensland bank of the river dividing my electorate from the Federal electorate of Gwydir were covered with tobacco farms, the cultivation of tobacco on the southern  side was neglected. A most successful tobacco-growing area was established there, with a local factory for the manufacturing of the locally-grown leaf&#62; whereas upon the New South Wales side . of the river no tobacco was produced.

                            I am speaking of a period prior to the advent of Federation, when the old State Tariffs were in operation. I am merely stating the facts as they are known to me, and I make no comment whatever upon them. Everybody who visited that district used to inquire,. &#34; How is it that tobacco is not grown on the opposite bank of the river? Surely there must be the same class of soil there?&#34;&#39; The difference of 3d. per lb. between the incidence of the two State Tariffs was responsible for this marked contrast. So that a margin of 3d. per lb. in a Tariff can exercise a very vital effect upon production. Whether it will make any considerable difference to the consumer is a simple question of arithmetic which we can work out for ourselves. It seems tome that it means that the man who smokes, a couple of ounces of tobacco per week will be called upon to contribute an extra threepence to the revenue every two months. I have already mentioned the fact that
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill,</inline>
                            the&#34; Queensland tobacco expert, is now in Melbourne. A short time ago, at the request of some of the Queensland representatives, I despatched an urgent telegram to the Premier of that State requesting that
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill1</inline>
                            might be instructed to proceed to Melbourne for the purpose of affording honorable members every possible information&#39;&#39; in reference to the tobacco industry, and also that he might be of assistance to the Government if they desired to avail themselves of his services. I understand that soon after his arrival in this city
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Nevill</inline>
                            got into communication with the Treasurer and his officers, and as a result the Government - very properly, I think - have acted upon his advice in regard to these duties. Probably,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline>
                            knows more about tobacco, from a general standpoint - that

                            from the ! point of view alike of the growers and of the manufacturers - than does any man in Australia. He was brought from the United States to Queensland as a tobacco expert, and lie has done splendid work there. He has thoroughly mastered all the details of the- * industry, and in acting upon his advice the Government are accepting the counsel of one who is anxious to see the growth and manufacture of tobacco in Australia encouraged as much as possible. Before I proceed further, I should like to make- a short explanation in reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Angas. The same question which occurred to the honorable member in reading the evidence tendered by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline>

                            - It can be stemmed at any time. It is stemmed into strips, but the stripping is a prior process altogether, which is always undertaken by the farmer. When the tobacco plant is cut, and while it is still green, the leaves are stripped from the main stalk, but the stemming, that is, converting it into strips, is another process entirely.

                        <para>Colonel FOXTON.- It is now proposed that we should reduce the import duty upon manufactured tobacco to  3s. 3d.  per lb. That would give a protection to the local manufacturer of imported leaf of  6d.  per lb. only, unless the duty on imported leaf be also reduced by the same amount. The duty upon the manufactured article would be  3s. 3d.  per lb., against which we have to set the duty upon the imported leaf, namely, is.  6d.  per lb. The cost of stemming is  3d.  per lb.,, and there would be an Excise duty of is. per lb. In other words, the local manufacturer of imported leaf would be required to pay  2s. 9d.  per lb., as against  3s. 3d.  per lb. upon the imported manufactured article. He would thus get a protection of only  6d.  per lb. That protection would be still further reduced if the cost of stemming is  4jd.  per lb. - as mentioned by the honorable member for Boothby - instead of  3d.  per lb. Further, in the process of stemming there is a loss of one- third in the weight of the tobacco, though I understand that in this connexion a refund of duty is made. </para>

But, inasmuch as the local leaf will be called upon to pay  3d.  per lb. for stemming, the manufacturer of that leaf will enjoy a protection of is.  3d.  per lb. </para>

                        <para>Colonel FOXTON. - I am arguing as to whether the local manufacturer will have a sufficient measure of protection. I have heard it suggested that there should be no distinction made between the import duty upon stemmed and unstemmed leaf. But I am assured that the process of stemming the leaf will give employment to not less than  600  hands. So that it is necessary that there should be a margin of at least  6d.  per lb. as between the duty upon stemmed and unstemmed leaf, if the stemming is, to be done locally. If no differentiation be made between stemmed and unstemmed leaf, a large measure of employment will be lost to operatives in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>Colonel FOXTON. - If we are to have protection at all, the scheme now before the Committee, is well devised, and is an equitable one as between the grower and the manufacturer. It gives to each a fair measure of protection, without, to any material extent, imposing additional burdens  upon trie consumer. The difference proposed by the honorable member for Angas will have a material effect on production, just as the difference between the Tariffs in New South Wales and Queensland had prior to Federation in the relative production of leaf in those States. </para>

                        <para>Colonel FOXTON.- But as between the two States there was a difference&#39; of only 3d. in the incidence; and such a difference, though vital to the grower, can be of very little moment to the consumer. Those who are engaged in the industry are of opinion that the proposals of the Government will give enormous encouragement to the growth of tobacco; and my opinion, though perhaps 1 am not so well able to speak on this point, is that the differentiation of 9d. will prove ample protection to the manufacturer. </para>

None of us, I am sure, desire to see such a result; and, therefore, I heartily support the proposal of the Government.

                            <para>-- I am glad that the Government have brought down amended proposals. Those who were members of the House when the last Tariff was under discussion, will remember that there was as big a fight over tobacco and cigars as over any item in the schedule. I believe, with the honorable member for Brisbane, that, if we agree to the proposal of the honorable member for Angas, the grower of tobacco will be adversely affected. Some few weeks ago we passed a Bounties Bill, in which the utmost encouragement to the cultivator of tobacco leaf was represented by 2d. per lb. ; and now the honorable member for Angas proposes to reduce the duty on imported leaf by 3d. per lb., and would thereby decrease the advantage to the grower by 50 per cent. </para>

When the old Tariff was under consideration, it was proposed that such a difference should be made; and I then pointed out that the necessary machine was in the control of the Combine, and was not permitted to be used by other manufacturers. The Combine will not allow the machine, used for the best class of cigars, to be availed of bv any outside competitor ; and under the new protection proposals, I hope it will be seen that the benefits do not all go to the machine,&#34; but that some- are extended to the workers. </para>

                                <para>- I have no doubt that, the head of the Excise branch will know how to define the tobacco in a way to meet the desires of honorable members. It is the small manufacturers who carry on the hand-made cigar industry, and their work should be secured to them, and not monopolized by the Combine with the machine. Some honorable members seem to think that, because the import duty on tobacco will be 3s. 6d., with an Excise of is. as heretofore, while unstemmed tobacco will bear a duty of is. 6d., the manufacturers are receiving increased protection to the extent of 3d. That, however, is not so, because manufacturers were able to import stemmed tobacco at is. 6d. previously,  whereas, under the Government proposal, they will now have to pay 2s. The stemming is estimated to cost about 4|d. per lb., so that the manufacturers will only have a margin of protection of about 7 Jd., while the stemming, I am informed, will give employment to 700 or 1,000 more operatives. Under the circumstances, I think the . experiment is worth making ; and I believe that the proper time  for stemming is when the leaf is dry. </para>

                        <para>I have taken the trouble to consult - -the Customs statistics; and I find that the importation of manufactured tobacco in 1904 amounted to 2,175,000 lbs., of which only 1,880,000 lbs. was taken out of bond. In 1905 the. quantity imported was 2,045,000 lbs., of which only 1,661,000 lbs. was taken out of bond; and in 1906 the quantity imported was 1,926,000 lbs., of which only 1,516,000 lbs. was taken out of bond. Over the three years the total quantity imported was ,147,000 lbs., of which 5,058,000 lbs. was taken out of bond, leaving about 1,100,000 lbs. in the custody of the Customs. I certainly think that the officers of the  Department should look into this matter, because, if there is that quantity of tobacco on which duty has not been collected, it is serious for the revenue. In the matter of cigars, I trust that some preferential treatment will be accorded to the hand-made variety; and I suggest that, instead of the 6d. per lb. Excise, as proposed, the Excise should be 3d. per lb. for hand-made cigars, and 9d. for machine-made cigars. The cigars made by machinery cost about ,6d. per 100 to manufacture, whereas the lowest price agreed to bv the Victorian Wages Board for making hand-made cigars is 2s. 6d., showing # a difference of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per 1,000 in favour of the machine-made article. Assuming that 1,000 cigars weigh 14 lbs., if we make a difference in the Excise to the extent of 6d. per lb. in the case of hand-made cigars, the manufacturers would still have a preference of 13s. per 1,000. I know that there are some cigars which are bunched by machinery and covered by hand, and that these cost more than 6d. per 100; but I do not think it costs three- times that sum to make them by this system, so the manufacturers would still* have a preference of well over 5s. per 1,000 in regard to the machine-made article. </para>
                        <para>I hope that&#39; the Government will adopt these proposals. It has abandoned the composite duty on  cigars, which, I believe, is the only composite duty left in the Tariff. The honorable member for Boothby and myself succeeded after a pretty hard fight in increasing the old import duty to 6s. 3d. Taking prices from the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of Commerce,</inline> I have worked out the duty payable on cigars of several makes. The duty .payable on a brand of Manilla cigars, which cost in bond &#163;1 18s. per 1,000, is &#163;4 13s., or 230 per cent. &#34; </para>
                        <para>Colonel  Foxton.&#39; -  We could produce that kind of cigar here. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. I should like to see more cigars made here. The duty chargeable on German cigars costing &#163;1 10s. per 1,000 in bond is &#163;4 12s., or about 300 per cent. But in respect to expensive cigars, the rate of duty is relatively lower. For instance, the duty on a superfine Havana cigar, costing <inline font-style="italic">&#163;16</inline> per 1,000 in bond, is less than 40 per cent. Then, taking the prices on the list of a Tri.chinopoli firm, which is one of the leading manufacturers of cigars in India, I find that one brand costs 26s. 8d. per 1,000, another 24s. per 1,000, another 21s. 4d. per 1,000, and another as little as 12s. per 1,000, and a gentleman to whom the local agency was offered, was promised 20 per cent, discount off the 12s. per 1,000 cigar. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will stick to the highest rate possible, so far as the import duty is concerned. I know that for the protection of the revenue a fixed duty is necessary, but. the effect of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty would astonish some people. Cigars which are sold in bundles at is. 6d. for ten, would probably pay a duty of more than is. Under the fixed rate cheap cigars pay a duty equivalent to sometimes as much as 400 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> while dear cigars pay at the rate of only 30 or 40 per cent. I wish to see more cigars made here. &#34; Last year we imported 346,937 lbs. of cigars, while Excise was paid on only 293,210 lbs., showing that the duties are not preventing importation. Excise duty was paid on 9,282,480 lbs. of locally manufactured cigars, cigarettes, and tobacco, while 7,538,241 lbs. of leaf were imported, so that about 1,750,000 lbs. only of locally grown leaf were used. I do not know whether it was the object of the recommendation of the Tariff Commission to encourage &#39; the local manufacture of tobacco. </para>

I hope that the Minister will differentiate between hand and machine-made cigars and tobacco, making the Excise on hand-made cigars 3d. per lb., and on machine-made cigars 9d. per lb. </para>

                                <para>- I would leave the Excise at  is.  per lb. for machine-made tobacco, and reduce it to&#39; 9d. for hand-made tobacco. That arrangement of the duties would give a preference of 6d. to handmade cigars, and of 3d. to hand-made tobacco, and would not, I think, injure the revenue. I understand that the honorable member for Melbourne has a proposal to make in reference to cigarettes. </para>

                            <para>.- We are at a great disadvantage in discussing this matter, because the Government has brought forward a new set of rates, which differ greatly from those in the Tariff, to which we have devoted study and attention, and upon which we were prepared to vote. These new proposals have not been put before us in print, and it is very difficult to keep in mind the alterations &#39;which the Government desire to make. However, I suppose we must worry along as best we can. I do not know why any departure from the rates of duty on the old Tariff has been proposed, and I had given notice of a series of amendments, which, if agreed to, would have the effect of re-imposing the old rates, which appear to have acted very fairly, both in their protective incidence and from a revenue point of view. </para>

                                <para>- I am not a protectionist, and, in any case, I did not know it &#39;was the intention of the Government to deal with the Excise, which is on the last page, simultaneously with the import duties, which are among the first items of the Tariff, and I left them to be dealt with when we come to them. I propose to support the reduction proposed by the honorable member for Angas, which is similar to that of which&#39; I gave notice. I see no reason for increasing the duty on manufactured tobacco. However much the duty on tobacco may be increased, smokers who can afford to pay for the best tobacco will buy the imported&#39; article; they will not buy the inferior locally-made tobacco simply because it is cheaper. Unless the importation of the better kinds of tobacco is absolutely prohibited, there will always be found smokers to buy it, notwithstanding a substantial increase in its price. Moreover, manufacturers must be able to obtain American leaf, because Australian leaf alone will not make a high-grade tobacco. But Australian leaf of the best grade,, mixed with imported leaf, will give a very good middle-class tobacco, which can be sold at from 2s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. a lb. The cheapest tobacco is made from Australian leaf alone, but Australian leaf does not approach in quality Virginian leaf. I do not know whether that is due to inherent defects in our soil, or to the lack of proper knowledge of , the proper method of curing, or to climatic conditions. That has not yet been discovered. In certain parts of the world there are small patches of. soil which alone are capable of producing certain high grade tobaccoes. For instance, in no other part of the world can tobacco equal to that produced in Cuba be grown, and tobacco similar to that produced in Virginia cannot be raised elsewhere. Despite almost identical conditions, so far as soil and climate are concerned, different results are obtained from the attempts to grow tobacco-, in different places. Notwithstanding anything we as a Parliament may do in the  way of increasing duties, it is absolutely certain that so long as the best tobacco is produced abroad it will be used here by those who can afford it -to the exclusion of Australian-grown tobacco, the best of which is far inferior to any that is imported. I do not wish it to be thought that I have any desire to decry the attempt being made to grow a high-grade tobacco in Australia. It is a very laudable enterprise, and providing it can be carried on with no increased cost to the consumer, there is every reason why the industry should be legitimately encouraged. Australian leaf is improving, and as time goes on the quality of Australian leaf will continue to do so. We are&#39; now capable of producing a better leaf than we could grow a few years ago, yet the best Australian leaf will not bear favorable comparison with that of Virginia.^ Local manufacturers are compelled to use imported Virginian leaf for the production of the best tobaccoes. I should like to point out that the  importations  of American tobacco considerably decreased under the old Tariff, so that there is no reason for these proposed increases of &#39; duties. In 1.900, or prior to Federation, the weight of imported tobacco upon which  duty  was paid was 3,401,758 lbs., but in 1906 the importations of manufactured tobacco had fallen off to 1,516,633 lbs., a decrease of 1,885,135 lbs. </para>

                                <para>- From &#39; a reliable source. The excess of locally manufactured tobacco over imported manufactured tobacco in 1900 . was 831,261 lbs., and in 1906 it sv as no less than 6,213,607 lbs. The difference in favour of locally manufactured tobacco during the six years period was 5,382,346 lbs. It will be seen that the effect of the old duty upon manufactured tobacco has been twofold. It has caused a decrease in the importation of manufactured tobacco, and at the same time an increase in the local output of tobacco. Surely the figures I have quoted show conclusively that there  is not the slightest necessity for- these proposed increases. We have seen that the local production of tobacco under the influence of the old duty has been enormously stimulated, and I cannot understand what object the  Government  have in proposing these increases, unless it is that they hope to secure an increased revenue. We certainly are not likely to import less tobacco under the higher duties than we have done. </para>

                                <para>- Under the old Tariff the importations of leaf tobacco have been nearly doubled. Its effect has not been to reduce the importation of . Virginian leaf, although it has largely stimulated local production. The reason why it has not stopped the importation of leaf tobacco is that the, manufacturers themselves find that they cannot make either a high or a middle class tobacco unless they mix imported leaf with the Australian-grown article. So far from tending to discourage importations of Virginian leaf, the old duty has increased them. In 1900, 4,060,322 lbs. of leaf were imported, whilst in 1906 no less than 7,220,534 lbs. were imported, or an increase of over 3,000,000 lbs. The importation of cigars, on the other hand, has fallen off, 507,480 lbs. having been imported in 1900, as against 316,271 lbs. in 1906. The output of locally-manufactured cigars under the old Tariff was more than doubled, so that there does not seem to be any need  to depart  from it. The figures are: 1900, 135,891 lbs. ; 1906, 292,800 lbs. Here we have eloquent testimony to the fact that no increase of duty is required so far as that class of goods is concerned. The same state of affairs is apparent in regard to the manufacture of cigarettes. The importation of cigarettes has fallen off during the six-year period. In 1900, 251,717 lbs. were imported, whilst in 1906 only 152,197 lbs. were imported. The local manufacture of cigarettes, like the local production of cigars, increased during the period under review; 623,000 lbs. having been produced in 1900 and 1,148,033 lbs. in 1906. There was thus an increase of over 500,000 lbs. Having regard to these figures, the proposal of the Government to increase the rates of duty appears a most extraordinary one. They show most conclusively that there was no necessity to interfere with the old rates. It seems to me that, iri their desire to give preference to Australian producers, they are willing to go to any length,, and without rhyme or reason. The- whole of their sympathies are with the local growers primarily, and, secondly,- with the manufacturers of local leaf products. They pay no regard whatever to the great masses of the people - the consumers. They do not pause to consider that an increase in the price of&#39; tobacco is a very serious matter to the. working man, who is called upon to pay the cost of this increased measure of protection. Under the circumstances, can we wonder that the workers are beginning to complain? Surely we should recognise that they have rights which ought to be conserved, although the Labour Party do not seem to think so. By compelling&#39; the consumers to pay high prices for their tobacco, the Government will force them to use inferior brands. If my protectionist friends are so anxious to exclude Virginian tobacco from the Australian market, why do they not set a good example by refusing to smoke other than Australian leaf ? &#39; Instead of. smoking the best brands of cigars, I suggest that they should smoke only Australian cigars,&#34; and that any failure to do so should involve them in a heavy penalty. Although they might not enjoy their smoke so well under such  circumstances,  they would at least have the consolation of knowing that, by their action, they were assisting an &#39;Australian industry. With regard to the cultivation of tobacco in Australia, I am credibly informed that there is no hope whatever of the manufacturers obtaining a sufficient supply of the local leaf to meet the requirements of our home market. </para>

                                <para>- I hope that, it will. I trust that we shall be able to improve the quality of the leaf, and to become large exporters. It must always be remembered that it does not follow that, because freetraders oppose the imposition of high duties, they are opposed to the establishment of Australian industries. No more erroneous impression could possibly get abroad. But we do say that there is a limit to the price which ought to be paid for the encouragement of local manufacture.- After all, the question of successful local manufacture depends upon the market that is available, and that in its turn depends upon population. Until we are able to attract a much greater population to our shores it is idle for us to expect _ to become a very large exporting community, seeing that we should then have to compete in the world&#39;s markets at prices governed- by the world&#39;s competition. I wish now to deal with a remark which was made by the honorable member for Perth. He stated that there was a disinclination on the part of the Tobacco Combine to use Australian leaf. The impression which I gathered from his observations was that local manufacturers desire to discourage the production of Australian leaf because it is more to their advantage to use imported leaf. I do not think that that is so. When we come to examine the question we find that it is to the interests of the local manufacturers to use Australian leaf in preference to imported leaf, because upon every pound of Australian leaf they effect a saving of is. 6d. in the rate of duty charged. Surely their commercial instinct is not entirely dead. Upon the face of it, the statement of the honorable member for Perth appears to be absolutely untenable. Upon the question of stemmed and unstemmed leaf, I do not pose as an authority, but I am informed that it is better to stem the leaf before it is imported, because the process of stemming before packing improves the quality of the leaf. That is to say, it is better to do the stemming while the tobacco leaf is fresh and green. </para>

By the access to American leaf &#39; manufacturers are able to blend in with the Colonial leaf and supply tobaccoes of middle price, varying from a net price of 2s. 6d. to 4S. fid. This, while allowing us to work in the Colonial leaf, permits us to  Supply  a good medium smoke at low prices. </para>

                        <para class="block">Returning to the question of stemming, I am informed that if tobacco is packed unstemmed, it has to undergo several operations and processes, including re-handling, re-moistening and re-packing, which means a reduction in weight and a material addition to the cost. Then, if the leaf be sent  unstemmed.  there has to be added the cost of stemming, extra freight on the weight of the stems, and greater expense of handling ;. so that I do not see any great advantage in the differential rate. We have been told, of course, that the stemming of the tobacco will give employment to something, like 600 additional hands; but that is pure conjecture, no substantial basis on which any such calculation could be made, having been placed before us. As to the control, of cigar-making machines, it may be that the Combine have possession of certain classes of machines, I do not know. But if that be so, why are the provisions of the Commerce Act or the Australian Industries Preservation Act not put into operation, on the ground that such control is in restraint of trade? Under such circumstances as those suggested, the law may be invoked ; and I should like to know; if the .Ministry have any, knowledge on the point, why it has not been set in motion. If the law is inoperative, the fact only shows how much time we have wasted in enacting the measures I have mentioned. </para>

                                <para>- Providing the legislation be of a proper kind. The trouble is that, with the best intentions, we pass legislation which we find to De inoperative. I intend to support the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Angas ; and I suppose that, in consequence, I shall be regarded by the Government as an enemy, not only to themselves&#39;, but to the country. It would have been far better to leave the old Tariff as it was. The effect of the proposed increases has been to dislocate, and, in some respects, almost paralyze the tobacco trade. The duties, have not only greatly increased the cost of tobacco to the consumer, but have seriously prejudiced a number of operatives engaged in the industry. I do not know what the effect on the revenue has been, but it is quite possible&#39; that it is very serious. . In any case, the proposals have brought about quite an unnecessary and indefensible disturbance of trade. I gave notice of an amendment on the same lines as that pro posed by the honorable member for Angas, but, as he has forestalled me, I can only come to his support. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not intend to detain the Committee at any length, because I think that short speeches, which&#39; have been my aim during the session, will greatly assist us in speedily disposing of the Tariff. The honorable member for Angas has made a. mistake similar to that made by the honorable member for Lang in reference to the question of stripping. So far as I understand, importers of tobacco desire to import it in as dry a state as possible, so that they may introduce the largest quantity on payment of a certain amount of duty. Tobacco, I believe, keeps better when it is unstemmed, and when it is desired to stem it, it is moistened with water. At any rate, the very finest kinds of leaf used for cigars are always imported unstemmed. The honorable member for Lang complains that we on this side do not pay attention to the criticism of the Opposition, and &#39;I may say that, while I have a certain amount of diluted respect for the Opposition corner, I have much more respect for the straight-out. Opposition, amongst whom are many revenue-tariff advocates, and, perhaps, one or two free-traders. On this side there are a good many protectionists, together with a good many revenue-tariff men, and also a few freetraders. The honorable member for Lang, I understand, intends to support certain amendments which make for a revenue Tariff ; but I, as a protectionist, cannot understand how he, as an absolute freetrader, can vote for any duty. If the honorable member votes for a revenue duty, he is a revenue-tariff man. </para>

                                <para>- :The House of Representatives in the present Parliament is made up of - revenue  tariffists,  moderate protectionists&#39;, more advanced protectionists, and protectionists, . and there are more protectionists of all kinds, right up to prohibitionists, than there are free-traders. In the early nineties I stated from the platform&#39; my belief that protection for the manufacturer without- protection for the employe which would secure him a fair wage and reasonable hours of labour, and protection by a list price for the purchasing public which would secure them honest prices, was a farce, a fallacy, and a fraud, and I am still of that opinion. But we are to have the new protection, and I look to protective duties to educate the great mass of our working population, so that when we come to have State workshops, we shall have citizens ready educated for the employments to which they will be called, and will not&#34; have to import men from other countries. The honorable member for Lang objected to the harvester legislation that it was not introduced at the proper time. I wish that, instead of criticising and destroying, he would help to build up and make better. If the ancient Britons had refused to take any steps in advance until the proper time had arrived, we, their descendants, would still be going about naked, our bodies painted with woad. The honorable member is old enough to remember when the insult was hurled at us that the expression &#34; Colonial-made &#34; implied that the things to which it applied were bad. Like one of the old Greeks, I judge a nation by its games. It was football and cricket that made the British soldier so worthy an exponent of the warlike art. When Australians asserted that they could pick a team to play an English eleven at  cricket, we heard of the audacity of the Colonials. &#39; The suggestion came from Evans, a New South Wales cricketer, and we showed .that we could hold our own in the cricket field. So I reply to the contention that we cannot- grow tobacco in Australia, that we can grow it. The honorable member for Boothby asks for a preference of  3d.  per lb. to hand-made or twisted tobacco. At one time there were a good many tobacco twisters in Melbourne, who did good work, and earned good wages, and I understand that at the present time South Australians prefer hand-made to machine-made tobacco. I do not intend to discuss the relative merits of the two processes, though machine-made tobacco does not suit me. But &#39;an advantage to be gained by giving a preference to hand-made tobacco is that its manufacture will enable men to earn a living, as cigar makers now do with their  &#163;5  licences, notwithstanding the operations of the Trust. I hope, therefore, that the Government will accept the honorable member&#39;s suggestion. A differentiation of  6d.  between hand-made and machine-made cigars would enable persons having enough capital to procure a cigar licence to make a living, despite the opposition of the Combine, and the competition of the sellers of cheap im- . ported cigars. The honorable member for Yarra quoted some of the prices at which a  Trichinopoly  cigar maker has offered to sell cigars in this market. He spoke of a brand offered here at 12s. per 1,000. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, a discount of 20 per cent. The price quoted was fixed on the assumption that the rupee is worth is.  4d&#34;.  Until lately the value of the Indian rupee fluctuated very much. I remember when it was  only  is.  1 1/2d.  Now an attempt has been made to fix its value by enactment at is.  4d.,  but a friend who recently returned from India informed me that the money-changers there will give more than sixteen rupees for a sovereign, so that possibly these cigars could be obtained for even less than 12s. When in India, some yeaTs ago, I found that skilled cigar-makers, who would not be surpassed anywhere, were earning a rupee for a day of ten hours&#39; solid work, which is- little more than a penny an hour. Could we expect any Australian by birth or &#34;adoption to accept a wage of that kind? India &#39; grows more tobacco than is grown by the United States of America, having in 1905  964-S34  acres under crop, whereas in the United States there were only  776,112  acres under crop. Those employed in tobacco  cultivation in the fields receive only 4 1/2d. for <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> day of unlimited length, it may be for sixteen hours&#39; work, and sometimes only 2d. a day. Messrs. Spencer Brothers, of Madras, from whom I obtained my information, supply cigars of good quality, and after hearing the figures which I have given, honorable members will not be surprised to learn that cigars are so cheap in India that in an hotel, when a man asks for a cigar instead of a drink, he is not charged for it. No doubt the encouragement of the hand-made cigar industry will give employment to a large number of men. I am told that there are legal &#39; gentlemen in this House whose services are in demand by the Standard- Oil Company, which I believe is connected with the Harvester Trust, und perhaps, indirectly, with the Tobacco Combine, and we may have to face opposition. But if more of the cigars smoked in Australia were made by hand here, there would be a larger circulation of money in the country. Most of the profits of the Tobacco Combine are spent out of Australia, but a man earning &#163;2 a week here would have spent 39s. of it by the Tuesday following the Saturday on which he was paid. Thus it is that when people are earning money in a country it is being constantly circulated- there, which is a healthy state of affairs. Although there are not now in Melbourne as many tobacco twisters as were here at one time, if a preference were given to hand-made tobacco, those who remain would teach their trade to others, though it is by no means an easy one to learn. With regard to cigarettes, I find that three-fourths of those consumed in Australia are made by the Tobacco Combine with machinery, and that upwards of eighty hands are employed in the operation, while Messrs. Sniders and Abrahams employ between 600 and 700 persons in making the remaining one-fourth by hand. If the Tobacco Combine made nothing but hand-made cigarettes, it would have to employ from 1,800 to 2,000 operatives. </para>

                                <para>- The best cigars are made bv hand. An American will pay a dollar for a good cigar, and if he likes a green cigar will see it rolled in the shop. When I went through the splendid factories in Manila, I found that the finest cigars were being made by hand by the best makers. I prefer hand-made to machine-made cigarettes; &#34;but to compete against the Combine nine hand-made cigarettes have to be sold for the price of ten machine-made cigarettes, although the cost of production is very much greater. I hope that the Minister will see his way clear to make a differentiation in favour of hand-made cigarettes. The feeling that we should nationalize the tobacco industry has been intensified by the recent action of the Combine. France derives from her national monopoly in .tobacco a larger revenue than the whole of Australia yields. In one year she has obtained from it as much as &#163;14,900,000. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Corangamite, as a medical man, knows very well that the choice of tobacco is largely a question of flavour, to which the palate becomes accustomed. Twenty-five years ago I learned to like the flavour of French tobacco, and recently, on the occasion of a visit to the South Sea Islands, I found that my taste for it had not been lost. In Holborn, London, there is a shop devoted to the sale of French &#39;tobacco to meet the demand of English art students, who. while in France, have learned to prefer it. How many brands of inferior tobacco have been placed on the Melbourne market within the last twenty-five years? Should I not be right in saying that during the last quarter nf a century something like fifty brands have been placed on the market, only to quickly, disappear? . That being so, why should the honorable member for Corangamite hurl at me the taunt that French tobacco is inferior ? Is any one prepared to-say that France is .lacking in its cuisine, its wines.  its music, its science, its art, or its literature? Does it not set the fashion to the world, and why should it fail in respect of its taste for tobacco? The French have learned to prefer a certain flavoured tobacco. Australians, when they go to England, object to the tobacco there obtainable; Englishmen, on coming to Australia, do not care for the locally-produced article, and Americans care for neither Australian nor English tobacco. </para>

I well remember meeting Tom1 Roberts on the hills in Wales on one occasion, when he said to me, &#34; Here, Bill, is some Australian tobacco. Throw away that English rubbish.&#34; He regarded the English tobacco as worthless, merely because his palate had not become accustomed to it. The French, in their taste for art and literature, rank amongst the highest in the civilized world. * </para>

                                <para>- I have already mentioned that in Holborn there is a shop devoted to the sale of French tobacco. I brought here recently a small quantity of French tobacco, and there are among my friends some Englishmen who like to have a cigarette made from it. As I have said, the French national tobacco monopoly has produced a revenue amounting in one year to no less than ^14,900,000. That, however, does not represent the total return from the industry. As the honorable member for Corangamite, who, I believe, has travelled from one end of France to the other, well knows, in every little village there is a tobacco shop kept, may be, by the widow of a man who has lost his life in an effort to save that of another. That widow, who is entitled to a pension, gains a livelihood by the sale of tobacco, and the profits she derives from her shop are not included iri the general returns. Indirectly,* France saves many &#39;thousands of pounds in that way. Let us see what the </para>

                        <para class="block"> Tobacco Combine in Australia is. I am informed that it consists of the British - Australasian Tobacco Company, the old States Tobacco Company, the old Cameron Tobacco Company - and I believe that there is a descendant of the original owner still living - the Dixson Tobacco Manufacturing Company, the American Tobacco Company, and Wills. &#39; As far back as 1889, I declared that I should like to see Victoria own its lights, its smokes,, and its drinks. I have no reason to recede from the position I then took up. France, which at present has a monopoly of the tobacco and match-making industries, is seriously considering the desirableness of nationalizing the alcohol, wine, and spirit industry, and it is estimated that an annual revenue of ^100,000,000 would thus be secured. If the Government could see their way to differentiate in favour of hand-made as against machine-made cigarettes to the extent of is. per lb., I should be delighted. I admit that I should be content with a differentiation of -9d. or of even 6d. per lb. </para>

Unfortunately, I have not been able to obtain the latest statistics, but, according toMulhall, the United &#39; States of America, in 1884&#39;, produced 240,000 tons, whilst, in- 1894, it had an output of only 180,000- tons. With the exception of India,&#34; and a few other countries, every country in that year had a decreased output. India, however, increased her output, as I have said, from 150,000 tons to 280,000 tons. The consumption of tobacco, according to <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall,</inline> in 1883, was as follows: - Belgium and Holland, 84 oz. per head of the  popula-tion  ; Switzerland, 82 oz. ; Turkey and Brazil, 70 oz. ;  the United Kingdom,. 23 oz. ; and Italy, 22 oz. </para>

                                <para>-  Her  consumption was equal to 30 oz.  per. head, and, having regard to her huge population, the total consumption must have been enormous. I do  not blame a combine for making as much profit as it can, as long as the law permits it to do so.  But the desire of our party is to uplift humanity by the best means, and I consider it my duty, as a representative of this city, to join in an _ effort to keep the Tobacco Combine in check. The only means of doing so is, so far as I can see, to nationalize the industry. We should follow the example of nations that have proved that the industry is a splendid revenue-producing one. Whilst I was in Tokio, a Minister of the Emperor of Japan assured me that the fact that the Government had just taken over the tobacco industry there was the means of enabling them to obtain better terms in connexion with their war loan than they would otherwise have been able to secure. Every country that has nationalized the industry has retained possession of it. We in Australia could do the same. It is often said that we cannot grow tobacco; but when we remember our vast territory, stretching from the sub-tropical regions of the narrow neck of land in the north down to the cold regions of Tasmania, I think that it is impertinent to make such a suggestion. The trouble is that hitherto we have lacked the necessary knowledge of the soils most suitable for the production of tobacco, and have not had the experience necessary to enable us to produce a first-class article. The representatives of Queensland well know that at one time it was said that cotton could not be grown in that State. Since then, however, Queensland has produced one of the finest kinds of cotton - a cotton plant that yields a larger crop than does any other variety. Why should we not produce good tobacco? Some countries produce tobacco which has in it no trace of the alkaloid of nicotine. The tobacco produced in Syria, for instance, has no trace of nicotine, whilst that produced in France has the largest proportion. Tobacco has been grown in England and Ireland, but the absurd laws which Great Britain passed did not permit of any successful attempt in that direction. Reverting to the question of local manufacture, my information is that there is a machine called the Baron, over which the Tobacco Combine has absolute control, and which it will not allow any but certain manufacturers to use. </para>

                                <para>- It is used in the manufacture of cigarettes. Of course&#39;, manufacturers are at liberty to purchase the Orient machine, but that is not considered such a good article. I hope that the Committee, in its wisdom, will say that tobacco is a commodity so largely used in Australia that its production shall be taken out of the control of the Combine, and that - if the time be not ripe for the na.tionalization of the industry - we shall, at least, prevent it from holding in its grip the best cigarette-making machine, and forbidding other manufacturers to use it. I am perfectly convinced that if we took a referendum to-morrow, as to whether or not the tobacco industry should be nationalized, the voice of Australia would be in favour of the adoption of that course. I have already given an example of the unchanging taste for French tobacco. I hold that a similar taste may be developed for Australian tobacco. Need I point out that at our splendid, workshops at Newport a locomotive can be . manufactured f&#176;r &#39;&#163;I,IO&#176; &#34;ess than it can be manufactured in England, and for &#163;900 less than it can be manufactured at the Baldwin works, Pennsylvania. Further, it is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent&#39;s</inline> intention - if New South Wales should again invite tenders for a supply of locomotives - to tender for their manufacture in the Government workshop, Victoria, In the light of these facts, can it be seriously suggested that we cannot produce a. high-grade tobacco from Australian leaf? We already have the example of three civilized countries before us in this connexion, namely, France, Italy, and Japan. Japan is moving faster than is any other country in the world in the nationalization of monopolies, and we should do well to imitate her example. I am thankful to the Committee for having afforded me such an attentive hearing. I .trust that the Treasurer will recollect that a differentiation in favour of the Australian cigarette-maker will mean the employment of 600 or 700 hands. If Sniders and Abrahams were to install machines for the manufacture of cigarettes, they would be able t.o dismiss all their hands, with the exception of twenty. </para>

                                <para>- The Combine, by employing seventy to eighty hands, manufacture three-fourths of the total cigarettes consumed in Australia. These are made by machines. Between 600 and 700 hands are required to supply the remaining one-fourth, which comprise hand-made cigarettes. If the Combine produced their cigarettes by hand they would need to employ between 1,800 and 2,000 operatives. In addition, the hand-made cigarettes are sold at nine for 3d., whereas the machine-made cigarettes are sold at ten for 3d: That difference of one-tenth represents the profit of the hand-made cigarettes. </para>

                            <para>. - I am very glad that the honorable member for Angas, the honorable member for .Grey, and the honorable member for Perth are prepared to give to our tobacco manufacturers the benefit of a margin of o.d. per lb. The only question .l.hatwe have to consider is, &#34; What is the best way so to arrange the duties as to confer the most advantage upon them ? &#34; I am sorry that I cannot agree with the amendment of the honorable member for Angas. I regard the new proposals of the Government as being very equitable. They fulfil precisely the intention of the protectionist section of this Committee. The honorable member for Grey has declared that nobody has asked for a higher duty upon imported tobacco than 3s. 3d. per lb. I can assure him that I have in my possession a communication from one quarter requesting that a duty of 3s. od. per lb. may be imposed, if the honorable member will turn to the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, he will find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> practically suggests a duty of 4s. per lb., which was the old Queensland rate - as has been already mentioned bv the honorable member for Brisbane. The Government propose a duty of only 3s. 6d. per lb. The honorable member for Grey also quoted figures with a view to show that last year there was an increase of 600,000 lbs. in the local manufacture of tobacco. If that be so, and if we can double that increase next year, I ask him to consider the number of additional hands to whom employment will be given. I intend to prove that there is not the margin in favour of local manufacturers which some honorable members have suggested. As the honorable member for Perth has referred to the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill,</inline> I desire to show what that gentleman is reported to have said in regard to suggested alterations in the Tariff. In progress report No. 12 of the protectionist section of the Commission, his evidence has been thus summarized - </para>

                            <para>It has been proposed, on behalf of Queensland, that the old State duties should be reverted to. It is believed! that the 4s. import, duty would not be objected to or combated so strongly as it was in 1901, for the reason that since that year the position of the trade has entirely changed. At that time the tobacco merchants controlled and encouraged the importation of manufactured tobacco, and fought, as  they had every right to do, against the imposition of a rate which differentiated too greatly between the import of manufactured tobacco and the import of leaf. Now that aspect of affairs does not concern the merchants, owing to the fact that all brands of tobacco imported are controlled by a combination of local manufacturers and their allies - the American and Imperial tobacco companies ; hence the imported leaf manufactured here will largely supplement imported manufactures. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Balaclava- has affirmed in this Chamber that he can produce samples of the very finest tobacco which is being grown in Victoria to-day, but that the growers cannot obtain anything like a fair price for it. If we increase the: duty upon tobacco I believe that those growers will experience no difficulty whatever in disposing of their product - </para>

                            <para>Referring to the same subject, the Premier of Queensland says, &#34; When the Commonwealth . Tariff was adopted it was generally understood that the preference it undoubtedly gave the manufacturer and importer over the farmer was due to the influence exercised by the importer of manufactured tobacco. But now the importer has no interest in the matter; for he no longer controls the trade, as a gigantic trust has usurped his place.&#34; </para>

                        <para>I intend to support the Government proposal, because it will place both the manufacturers and their employes in a better position- than that which they have occupied hitherto. There seems to be a misunderstanding in regard to the proposal of the Government in reference to stemmed and unstemmed tobacco. Whilst it is stated that the cost of stemming in Australia would be only 3d. per lb., the Government propose to make a difference of 6d. per lb. between the stemmed and unstemmed tobacco. But, as has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill,</inline> if unstemmed leaf be dutiable at is. od. per lb., and stemmed leaf  at 2S. per lb., as was proposed in the Tariff, inasmuch as the stemming is estimated to cost 3d. per lb., the duty on leaf stemmed or unstemmed would be 2s. per lb. This would give the manufacturer of tobacco from imported leaf a protection of only 3d. per lb., as compared with 9d. per lb. under the old Tariff, which imposed a duty of is. 6d. per lb. in both instances. Consequently if the Government proposal be carried we shall merely be placing manufacturers in the position that they formerly occupied. I do not see why we cannot grow all the tobacco that we require in the Commonwealth. For many years I smoked nothing but twist tobacco made in South Australia, but, although it was a clean, first-class article, I found I was smoking so much as to affect my health. In view of the fact that tobacco of that class can be produced, I think a majority of honorable members will be found to vote for some differentiation in the Excise, so far as the twist variety is concerned. </para>

                                <para>- I think we can do better by adopting the proposal of the Government. I know the Government feel some difficulty, in so far as they . fear that possibly other tobaccoes may be brought within the definition. However, &#34; strand tobacco &#34; is a trade term, and, in my opinion, there is no danger in this connexion. In framing a Tariff it is not sufficient to place manufacturers on the old basis, but we ought to endeavour to put them on a better basis, and it is from that stand-point I view the question. We have been told by honorable members that when there is a Government monopoly the consumer is supplied with only bad tobacco; but when a combine has the monopoly the consumer has to put up . with what they choose to give him. According to the honorable member for Boothby, and also according to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, all kinds of inferior and foreign material has been mixed with tobacco supplied to the public. That. I think, would not occur if there were a State monopoly, because honorable members, who found their supplies adulterated, would have a good deal to say about it within these walls. </para>

                                <para>- I may tell honorable members that, when I gave some French friends the best tobacco I could buv in London, they did not like it, and I equally disliked the French tobacco which they gave to me. That only proved, however, that we were accustomed to a certain flavour in our tobaccoes, not that either of the tobaccoes was inferior. Some years ago the only twist tobacco made in South Australia was a dark, strong twist, which I found it impossible to smoke, although it was a first-class article. But I am glad to say that, when it was pointed out that a lighter tobacco was required, the demand was supplied, and the product is a great favorite not only in South Australia, but in Western Australia; it is, I believe, largely used at Broken Hill. We have been charged with, a desire to prevent the introduction of machinery, but for that charge there is no foundation. At the same&#39; time, we ought to do nothing to throw hand workers out of employment. The consequences are cruel enough when that result is brought about by the use of machinery, without our unnecessarily creating trouble of the kind. </para>

                                <para>- Undoubtedly I could. A really first-class cigar is made from a blend of tobaccoes, even as many as four, grown in different parts of the world, whereas a second-class cigar may contain only three different kinds, and a third-class cigar only two, while a machine-made cigar is composed of one class, and is, consequently, the cheapest. It is impossible with the present machinery to make cigars of the blend which gives the desired flavour. I admit that, at pieseiil, the highest grades&#39; of leaf are not grown in Australia; but I believe the day will come when these will be grown here. It is not that we cannot grow the higher grades of tobacco. </para>

                                <para>- Undoubtedly. My belief, is that, under the provisions of the Bounties Bill, as amended on my motion, these higher  grades  of tobacco will be produced. In 1901-2, there were 914,368 lbs. of tobacco produced in Australia, and, in 1905-6. the production had increased to 2,123,744 lbs. ; and yet we hear honorable members declaring that tobacco cannot be produced within the Commonwealth. If it is possible to produce over 2,000,000 lbs., we could, no doubt, produce 20,000,000 lbs. if  neces-sary. </para>

                                <para>- Chinamen will not be here very long to grow it. The tobacco I have seen produced by Chinamen in New South Wales and Victoria is very inferior, and almost unsaleable, owing to the fact that they do not know how to cure it. Much experiment is required in regard to the production of tobacco. We know that in the United States seeds obtained from Cuba, Havana, and Virginia, ! and planted in various districts, produce a leaf quite different from that which results in the centres of origin. I hope the time will soon arrive when there will be established in Australia an Agricultural Bureau, with well-paid, first-class chemists attached; and when that time does arrive, we shall find that what can be done in America can be done here. . The honorable member for Lang stated that last year there were manufactured in Australia 7,800,000 lbs., of tobacco, while 1,500,000 lbs. were imported. What is there to prevent our manufacturing the whole? The less we import under present conditions, the more chance will be given to a number of small manufacturers throughout the Commonwealth to make a livelihood. I do not think it necessary to discuss this item at any length. There seems very little desire on the part of honorable members opposite to discuss the question; and I take it for. granted that they are convinced of the reasonableness of the proposals of the Government, or, at any rate, that they do not propose to offer any factious opposition. Whatever machinery may do in the future, we have been shown </para>

                        <para>Aery clearly the advisability of extending a small preference in favour of hand-made tobacco, and a larger preference in  favour  of hand-made cigars. Only the best leaf is used by the hand worker; and such a preference is in the interests of the smoking public. If it be true that a quarter of the cigarettes consumed are hand made at present, I feel sure honorable members will not exclude those engaged in this branch of the industry from the benefits of the proposal before us, whatever the profits of the industry may be; because it is a great gain to the Commonwealth to afford this employment. While I feel sure that the honorable member for Angas is sincere in the proposal he has made, the Government proposal is, in my opinion, better. </para>

                            <para>.- I hope that in our future transactions in connexion with the Tariff the Government will be a little more considerate of the Committee than they have been to-day in the consideration of these important items. The least the Government can do when they propose to depart from the proposals which have been before us so long is to give us the earliest possible notice of what they really intend to submit, especially in connexion with items which have so many ramifications as those under the head of tobacco. </para>

                                <para>- It is because I have tried it that I say that. &#34;I was deceived by the appearance of happiness mantling human countenances whose owners were busy drawing at their pipes, and at the age of eleven, in an unguarded moment, endeavoured to procure for myself this meretricious enjoyment. I bought a clay pipe and a plug of negro head tobacco; but I found that the happiness which others enjoyed was not for me, and from that moment I have not contributed to the Customs bv the purchase of either tobacco, cigars, or cigarettes. But, having a kindly interest in the revenue, when I see Australians puffing away at all times and in all places, I regard them as, even in their hours of weakness, extremely energetic revenue providers. The new Tariff proposals do not contain any startling change of policy. Even in New :South Wales there was a considerable difference - a difference of 9d. - between the duty on imported tobacco and the Excise, to encourage local production and manufacture. In Australia we possess a country in which tobacco can be grown, and fiscal experiments for the encouragement of industries have better prospects when undertaken in connexion with articles capable of easy local production. But the history of tobacco growing in Australia is one of the worst chapters in the records of Australian industries. As far back as 1888, according to a report laid before us in connexion with the Bounties Bill, the weight of leaf produced in the Commonwealth was 7,868 ,000 lbs., while last year only 1,400,000 lbs. were produced. </para>

                                <para>- No doubt that is one of the safest uses to which some of the Australian tobacco could be devoted. But it is most disappointing that, during the past twenty years, tobacco growing has had such a chequered experience. In 1905 the production of leaf was 2&#39;,000,000 lbs., and the following year 1,400,000. These- figures seem to support the conclusion of the honorable member for Lang that the crop is of the most precarious kind. </para>

                                <para>- How many thousands per cent, are we to give for the encouragement of tobacco growing? The true patriotic protectionist can, in a most simple way, place the Australian tobacco industry on a sound footing, and cause the heart of the planter to rejoice. He has merely to refrain from smoking imported tobacco, and to smoke only Australian tobacco. Honorable members are prepared to die on the floor of this chamber voting for duties for the protection of the growers of tobacco leaf, but they are not prepared to smoke a pipe of colonial tobacco. It is a source of regret to me that my protectionist friends, who are prepared to make such enormous sacrifices in the imposition of duties on behalf of Australian industries, will not make the personal sacrifice involved in smoking colonial tobacco and drinking colonial beer. The  self-denying  protectionists of Australia have only k&#62; make a solemn league and covenant, for the sake of our national industries, to drink nothing- but colonial beer - they can get a large quantity at a very reasonable rate - and smoke nothing but colonial tobacco  - which they can buy for  2s. 6d.  a lb.to place both industries on their feet. I suppose that they shrink from doing so because of their horror of the curse of cheapness, colonial beer and colonial tobacco being too cheap for them. The present Tariff law fixed the duty on imported tobacco at  3s. 3d.,  and the original Tariff proposal of the Government - because what we are discussing is not a Tariff- </para>

                                <para>- Of course they are. The honorable gentleman would lay his hands on anything he could get. It is a mercy that he is not collecting twice as much as he proposes to levy. The first Government Tariff proposal was to increase the import duty by  3d.  per lb. In my opinion, a duty of  3s. 3d.  per lb. is heavy enough, because it is equal to much more than  50  per cent, on the value of the imported tobacco upon which it is levied. I see no reason for increasing it. Then, under the present Tariff law, the duty on imported leaf, whether stemmed or unstemmed, is is.  6d.,  but in its Tariff proposals the Government first made a difference of  3d.  per lb. in favour of the unstemmed leaf, and now put forward a difference of  6d.   per lb. ; which, it seems to me, is going too far, being altogether out of proportion to the difference between the costs of manufacturing stemmed and unstemmed tobacco leaf. As for the Excise, the present Tariff law imposed a duty of is., which the Government Tariff proposals increased first to is.  3d.,  but now bring back to is. Ministers now propose an increase of  3d.  in the duty, and a decrease of  3d.  in the Excise. In my opinion, that is not sound finance. The difference between is. Excise and  3s. 3d.  import duty is quite sufficient for the encouragement of local manufacture; there is no need to increase the difference to  2s. 6d.  There is no warrant for the difference. It is not in the interest of the revenue, and it is not in the legitimate interest of the colonial leaf. We must remember that the colonial leaf is sold at about  6d.  per lb. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. Let us glance for a moment at the difference between the duty on the imported unstemmed leaf and the price of the colonial leaf. I suppose that colonial leaf is sold unstemmed, so that the basis I am taking isa fair one. The colonial leaf, as I have said, commands, not always, but sometimes, a price of 6d. per lb., whilst under these proposals the imported unstemmed&#39; leaf will be subject to a duty of is. 6d. per lb. There will thus be a protection cf  300  per cent, on the total value of the colonial leaf as sold in the Australian markets to-day. Surely that is all that can be honestly wanted in the interests of the tobacco-grower. The fact is, however, that under cover of these duties a lot of other people are running after the public money. No producer of Australian leaf wants a duty in excess of  300  per cent. If we put a duty of  5s.  per lb. upon imported leaf we should not long increase the value of the colonial leaf, since there would be in no time an enormous increase in production. Surely the difference existing under the present law, which I understand the honorable member for Angas wishes to retain, is a legitimate one. There has been no strong appeal that I know of to alter that aspect of the Tariff. The Government proposals have created a number of demands for consideration ;. they haw given rise to a feeling of unrest. There are in connexion with the trade grievances of which we have heard a great deal, and which I hope some day will be thoroughly investigated by some impartial authority ; but there was no feeling of unrest or dissatisfaction until the present Tariff was submitted. I feel  that under these circumstances it would be well to leave the duties as they were, so far as&#39; the manufactured and unmanufactured tobacco and the Excise upon them are concerned. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. What is called the Combine is naturally playing a leading part in all the troubles connected with these tobacco items. I have no feeling of kinship with any large trading combine, since in the first place it is pre-eminently able to look after itself, and does not need! much sympathv. </para>

                                <para>- If the devil himself supported me, I should not grumble. I do not think my honorable friend inquired into the individual characteristics of those who voted for him. I look upon a combine of capital as beingprima <inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> just as honest and as. respectable as is a combine of labour. The man who can see all sorts of wickedness in the act of ten business men uniting is not the man who looks upon unionism as one of the remedies for industrial evils. The principle of the combine is embodied in every trade union, and it is absurd for those who believe in trade unionism to think it an object of wickedness when other people adopt it. But I say as to all combines, labour or capital, that the State should secure strength enough to deal with them whenever they abuse their powers. Any man who is not prepared to throw the searchlight of the Government on any industrial body, whether of workers or of capitalists, who are abusing their power or exercising it in any way prejudicial to the community, is oblivious of what the future has in store for us. Notwithstanding the view of some who represent me, . since I am a freetrader, as believing, without regard to consequences, in the dry principles of political economy, I. think that, without any necessity for the desperate expedient of Socialism, the law of human progress will inevitably bring the power of government more and more in touch with all evils, abuses, and wrongs, from whatever quarter they come. Combines that do wrong will have to be dealt with just as the individual wrong-doer is dealt with in our courts of law. That is a- principle which every one ought to cheerfully recognise. But, just as -in our courts of law we do not prejudge a man who is brought up for trial - we do not find him guilty before a jurv has tried him - so we must extend similar treatment to combines. Charges against any combine, whether a trade union or a combination of tobacco producers, are not to be accepted as gospel simply because they are made. I am prepared to support an investigation into the operations of any of these bodies when a proper case is presented for the adoption of that course. </para>

                                <para>- We do not want to get away from the ordinary principles of justice. They ought to be applied to every investigation and every exercise o&#39;f &#39;the Executive power. It is a wild injustice to those who have combined in this case to suggest that they wish to crush the tobacco leaf producer. What interest has a main in crushing one who can provide him with an article three times as cheap as that which he&#34; has to import ? It would be, indeed, a novel form of aberration on the part of a great trading corporation to insist on paying is. 6d. per lb. on imported leaf from the other end of the globe when they could obtain the commodity at their own doors for 6d. per lb. </para>

It is generally suggested that a monopoly plays the part of a vampire, and is sucking the blood of some victim in order to enrich itself.

These very honorable members who are prepared to exhaust their resources of oratory in defence of the local tobacco grower cannot be induced to smoke a leaf &#34;of colonial tobacco. What chance has this Combine of making tobacco from colonial leaf, when the members of the Labour Party will not smoke it? </para>

                                <para>- Had it been made in Havana, the honorable member would have smoked it long ago. Honorable members of the Labour Party carry these colonial cigar&#39;s for exhibition purposes; they never smoke them. The position is that smokers will not use colonial tobacco unless it is largely blended with a tobacco which commands, to a large extent, their approval. I hope that, in all our dealings with combines, we shall be commonly  fair. If the Combine in the manufacture of their tobacco used a larger proportion of colonial leaf they would not meet the taste of their customers. It is a great calamity that colonial leaf as at present produced is not better suited to the taste of the Australian smoker. I believe that a genuine colonial tobacco can be obtained at about  2s.  6d. per lb. </para>

                                <para>- Then we can understand why there is not a great demand for it. But the initial trouble is that unfortunately the Australian leaf is not one which is prized by the smokers of this continent. I trust that we all feel the warmest sympathy with every effort to produce a better quality of leaf. But even those who wish to push their protectionist views to an extreme must admit that a duty of  300  per cent, is sufficient to give the industry a fair start - assuming that other conditions are favorable. But the industry has to fight against difficulties- </para>

                                <para>- The. history of attempts to grow good tobacco in Australia has&#39; been a most dreary one. Long before the Combine was established the price of colonial leaf was heartbreaking to all but Chinese growers. . The main difficulty in this connexion is that the Australian leaf does not appeal to the taste of the average smoker. Every effort that we can make to improve the prospects of the grower ought to be made. I think that in the Bounties Bill an effort has been made in that direction.  There is nothing in the difference between these two proposals to cause protracted debate. So far as I am personally concerned, I prefer the Tariff as it now stands. The honorable member for Melbourne expressed himself in favour of the nationalization of the industry. That course is not proposed by the&#39; Government. </para>

                        <para>Mr.REID. - The attempts to differentiate between hand-made and machine-made articles seem to be a repetition of the old battle which was waged when machinery was first invented. Surely that is not to be fought over again. Some results of the introduction of improved machinery are very melancholy for the moment. The use of such machinery leads to distress and want of employment for a time, but, nevertheless, the improvement of the masses is closely identified with the improvement, of these mechanical inventions. The more the conditions of labour are improved, the more it rises from the position of a hewer of wood and drawer of water. Any attempt to set back the march of human labour in alliance with human invention, and the best &#39;possible mechanical means of production, is not in the true and lasting interests of the great masses of the people. </para>

                                <para>- An evil of that sort is one to be remedied in a general way. The question is whether our patent laws should not be dealt with so as to prevent that and every corresponding evil. In regard to the nationalization of industries, I do not think that we need discuss that question at length, because there is no proposition of the kind before the Committee. I have dealt with it often before, and I am prepared to do so again. But probably time will be economized if we confine ourselves to the practical position of to-day, &#39; and to the proposal which is before us. I shall merely make one observation in reference to that very attractive project - the nationalization of industries. I say that their nationalization would lead -to dangers which are even greater than, those attaching to the existence of a private combine. If a private combine acts, tyrannically there is a power which can redress the wrongs which it seeks to inflict, and which can keep it within legitimate bounds. But if the power of the State is behind a monopoly- </para>

                                <para>- America is a shocking example of the extraordinary ineptitude of which a highly civilized people are capable. In one of the freest and most enlightened countries in the world, year after year we behold the spectacle of the people submitting to gigantic robberies. This fact shows how little practical good the Constitution can accomplish. We hear that all men are born free and equal in the United States, but another clause must now be added to that familiar recitation, namely, &#34; except members of trusts,&#34; who are somewhat superior to every other member of the grand republic. One of the dangers of nationalization is that the power behind a monopoly cannot very well be corrected. I think that we shall require to nationalize some industry when we establish our Australian Navy. We shall need to make something out of somebody, in order to maintain it. Other countries maintain their armies and fleets by the profits which they make out of State monopolies. In France, the tobacco smokers are sweated in order to pay for the upkeep of the army and navy. The Government give them an article which is not worth half the money that they pay for it- </para>

                            <para>.- I desire to say one or two words in reply to the observations of the honorable member for East Sydney. He holds that the proposals of the Government are substantially in the interest of the growers of tobacco, and that the Combine would not be so. foolish as to pay the higher duty upon imported leaf if it could get the advantages indicated under the Excise conditions laid down by the Government. I admit that appearances are altogether against me in that respect, and in favour of the honorable member&#39;s theory. But what are the facts? Under the old Tariff, a very substantial preference was given to the locally-grown leaf as against the imported leaf. Yet we find <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill,</inline> the expert from Queensland,  giving evidence before the Tariff Commission, as to the way in which the leaf produced in that State had to seek a market, sometimes in vain, in Australia. The following is an extract from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill&#39;s</inline> evidence - 2S515. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wamsley.</inline> - According to your statement, it is only a question of time when the local tobacco industry will become extinct; but have you not said that the leaf which is grown here finds a market at a good price? - lt has done so hitherto, but last year the buyers left between fifty and sixty tons of our crop. I called their attention to this fact, and that I thought they had discriminated against a certain community. They came up again, and bought about twenty tons more ; but they stated that they did not know what they would do with the tobacco, as they had more on hand than they could use. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member accentuates a point that was obvious to the Tariff Commission, though I think it is not obvious to honorable members. It appeared to the Commission that the whole difficulty in regard to the production of Australian leaf and the development of that important industry is due to the differentiation that has nearly always existed between the imported unmanufactured leaf and manufactured tobacco. The manufacturer imports unmanufactured leaf, and there is what appears to amount to a disability as against the local article. But the manufacturer introduces into every 10 lbs. of that unmanufactured leaf somewhere about 2 lbs. of other materials, in the shape of glycerine, liquorice, and so forth, and then he adds, we will say, 15 per cent, of Australian leaf. Under these circumstances, we know that the manufacturer makes profits sufficiently substantial to satisfy any reasonable person. When the grower of Australian leaf comes into the market, the manufacturer sometimes says, &#34; I will give you such and such a price, but I can only take a few tons, because I am  already  stocked up with leaf from other sources.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- At any rate, the Tariff Commission was so fully seized of these facts that I believe every member made up his mind that the disability in. connexion with the development of the tobacco-growing industry was due to the differentiation between unmanufactured imported leaf and manufactured tobacco. The free-trade section of the Commission recommended that the differentiation should be reduced to 3d., while the protectionist section suggested 6d. Speaking for myself, although I signed the report with mv colleagues, I thought 6d. was a fair differentiation. I hold the opinion very strongly that, if we establish a greater differentiation than 6d.. we shall still play into the hands of those people who, I believe, and as I think the facts show, have treated the tobacco grower of Australia with so much indifference as to prevent the development of the industry. </para>

                            (Melbourne Ports&#62; &#91;9.36&#93;. - In dealing with these items, we have, no doubt, first of all to consider the question from the revenue stand-point. I claim, however, that last year, and in previous years, the Commonwealth has done very well out of the smoker, considering that in taxation he has paid somewhere about ^1,600,000 per annum. I am willing to tax the smoker, seeing that tobacco is a luxury ; but there is a limit even in this, connexion. We have, of course, to consider the grower, and also the manufacturer ; and, although protectionists are never supposed to pay any regard to the consumer, he also must have some regard paid to him in the matter of price and flavour. The use of any particular kind of tobacco is really a matter of taste in a given locality ; and on this question the honorable member for Melbourne has expatiated to-night. I am not a scientist, but from what I have been told and have read, it appears that the. flavour of tobacco is owing to some microbe which attacks the leaf ; and we must, apply that microbe artificially, or be content with the flavour imparted by the local conditions.

                            <para>- It has been proved conclusively that climate is not the only influence. I suppose that tobaccoes of Cuba and Sumatra are the best obtainable 111 the world for the use of the cigarmaker. Now, in Sumatra, on one side of a river there is an estate called Deli, and, on the other side, another estate called Serdang; and yet, although the climate and the conditions as to labour and so forth are precisely the same, the tobacco produced on one estate is worth four or five times as much as the tobacco produced on the other. Similar results are observable in Cuba, where tobacco grown on one side of a mountain may have a value one hundredfold higher than that of tobacco grown on the other side. In the United States, where there are agricultural colleges, and a bureau such as we desire, and where hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent by the Government and private individuals in the cultivation of the leaf, it has been found necessary to import from both Cuba and Sumatra the high-class tobaccoes necessary for the manufacture of cigars. As I have said, it is sometimes charged against the protectionist that he pays no regard to the consumer; but the facts show that when we are considering how far we should go in the way of protecting this commodity, we must also consider the tastes of the people. I am willing to give the local tobacco grower certain consideration, but, while I believe that tobacco will be grown successfully in the northern portions of the Commonwealth, it is quite possible, in view of American experience, that all the leaf we require will not be produced here. As to the alterations suggested in regard to plug tobacco, I am entirely with the Government. As to cigars, however, I do not think that, even now, the Government are affording sufficient protection to the local manufacturer. In Australia to-day, there are commercial travellers selling Indian cigars, manufactured from Indian leaf, flavoured with leaf from Sumatra and Java. In view of the figures which I shall cite, I ask how can tEe manufacturers or workers in Australia compete against these commodities ? There is an Indian cigar on the Australian market which is manufactured at 15 rupees, or, say, 20s. per 1,000. To make a similar cigar in Australia would cost &#163;1 15s. per 1,000, after which the cigars must be sorted, because, in order to please, not only the palate, but the eye of the purchaser, they must, all be pretty nearly of the same shade. That sorting costs 4s. per 1,000, and then there has to be added 5s. for the stripping of the leaf. Further, boxes and labels are responsible for another 13s. <inline font-style="italic">66.,</inline> and then the tobacco itself, with duty and Excise paid, has to be procured, and provision made for rent, advertising, superintendence, distribution, collection, and so forth. The Indian cigars are made and sold at 20s. per 1,000,&#39; with a discount. </para>

                                <para>- No; in appearance they are high-class cigars, and I have been informed that they are a fairly good smoke. There is a discount besides. Of course, the duty must be added to these, prices to arrive at the price to the consumer. The local manufacturers have to compete not only with cheap Indian cigars, but also with cheap European cigars. This is some of the evidence given by Mr: Kirwan before the Tariff Commission - and it was not refuted - </para>

                                <para>- Yes; the honorable member will see that if he looks at the list from which I obtained my information. Notwithstanding the changes which the Government propose, the Tariff will still bear hardly on Melbourne manufacturers of cigars. Under the old Tariff the average duty on imported cigars was about 7s. 4d. per lb., but under the present Tariff it will be 7s. 6d., a gain of 2d. to the local makers. Then the Excise on hand-made cigars is now 6d., instead of is. 6d., making the total difference in favour- of the local manufacturer is. 2d. But, whereas the former duty on unstemmed tobacco for manufacturing cigars was is. 6d., it is now 3s., and in dealing with cigar manufacture it is the duty on unstemmed leaf which must be taken into consideration, because, before the imported cigars can be made up, the leaf is stemmed. Therefore, while the local manufacturers of cigars gain is. 2d. in the difference between the duty and Excise on cigars, they lose is. 6d. in the difference between the former and the present duty on unstemmed leaf - a net loss of 4d. per lb. It takes about 17 lbs-, of tobacco to make 1,000 cigars, which, when dry, weigh about 13 or 14 lbs. All tobacco imported &#39; into Australia contains about 10 per cent, of moisture, for which a rebate is allowed amounting to 1 lb. 11 ozs., whereas local manufacturers have to pay Excise on the full weight of 17 lbs. per 1,000. This is an additional disadvantage. Furthermore, there is a duty of 2s. 6d. per 100 superficial feet on prepared wood. </para>

                                <para>- To give the local manufacturers of cigars proper encouragement we must do several things. In the first place, we must reduce the Excise duty to 3d. on hand-made cigars and to od. on machine-made cigars. Next, we must require importers to pay 4d. on every box in. which they import cigars, because it would? not be fair to place our cigar manufacturers at a disadvantage by requiring them to pay a duty not imposed on importers. </para>

                                <para>- No. . As a protectionist I believe in it. Probably we have timber here which in time will be found suitable for cigar boxes ; but, in the meanwhile, the local manufacturer should not be put to a disadvantage. The facts, as they are stated, are worthy of consideration by the Government, if they have not been given consideration before. </para>

                                <para>- The chief reason put forward for the proposed reduction is that it will reinstate the old&#39; rate.

In dealing with these duties as protective duties equivalent to 200 or 300 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> honorable members are getting on to a very wide track. The leader of free-trade thought in this country admitted to-night that he has never looked on these as protective duties. </para>

                                <para>- Honorable members are aware&#39; that we had to deal hurriedly with the recommendations, and submit our proposals to the House. As protectionists we felt that in many cases duties in excess of those recommended by the Commission were desirable, and we had no hesitation in asking Parliament to adopt our proposals. Where there was grave reason for doubt as to some of the recommendations of the Commission we simply placed them before the Parliament and in the case of the tobacco duties we have submitted to-night an amended proposal. I admit that there is a great deal of force &#39;in the observation of the leader of the Opposition, that the Committee would have been in a better position to deal with the question had we been able this afternoon to circulate printed copies of the new proposals. I would point out, however, that great difficulty was experienced in arriving&#34; at a conclusion as to the best course to adopt with regard to these items. Many days were devoted to the work of preparing a scheme which would operate fairly to the grower, the manufacturer, the employer, the employe, and the revenue. I think it is desirable to compare the amendment moved&#39; by the honorable member for Angas with, the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. Let us take first of all the position of the grower. It has been argued by the leader of the Opposition that Australia cannot produce good tobacco. </para>

                                <para>- And under what conditions? We are all aware of the difficulties under which the cultivation of tobacco has proceeded. In only one State has anything like a determined&#39; effort been made to establish the industry. The growers have not had a fair opportunity. If because of droughts, or of pests such as blue mould, the enterprise has failed, surely we ought not to condemn it. That, however, is practically what the leader of the Opposition would do. We do not condemn the pastoral industry simply because a drought in one part of the Commonwealth leads to the. decimation of the flocks there. </para>

                                <para>- The right honorable gentleman gave us his experience of some imported tobacco, fronfwhich it would appear that it was the worst that could be smoked. In my opinion, tobacco-growing in Australia has not had a fair trial. The position in other countries is different. If there is a failure of the tobacco crop of Virginia, it is compensated for by the output in Carolina, Tennessee, Maryland, or some other State. There is not a complete failure of the tobacco crop in America; but in Australia, the position is different. </para>

                                <para>- Of course it will. From a revenue stand-point, our amended proposal will certainly be better than those originally submitted by the Government. Instead of offering- a premium, as one section of the Tariff Commission proposed, to the manufacture of tobacco in other countries, we are providing for a wider margin so that, in order to meet the demand for a tobacco consisting largely of imported leaf, the work of stemming that  leaf and turning it into the manufactured article may be carried on in Australia instead of abroad, and more employment given to dur people. </para>

It cannot be denied that under our amended proposal more employment will be provided in the manufacture of tobacco from imported and locally grown leaf. In view of the margin in favour of the local leaf, it will pay the manufacturers, to largely use that leaf in the manufacture of tobacco. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member . has been urging most strongly by way of interjections that the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Angas should be adopted, but he is too fair to assert that it would have the effect of reducing prices. I am most anxious to hear him, and shall be glad to at once give him an opportunity to speak. </para>

                            <para>. - It was an amendment of my own, which resulted&#39; in the margin which existed under the old Tariff between the duty levied upon the imported as against the locally-manufactured article. I had some reason, therefore, to speak in support of the proposal of the Honorable member for Angas upon that ground. But, rather than occupy the time of the Committee, I had decided to remain silent. When the Minister of Trade and Customs observes indications of that kind amongst members of the Committee, he should be careful to avoid arousing fresh debate. Apparently, the honorable gentleman has not understood his own proposal. In the first place, he impressed upon the Committee the necessity for standing by the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. He spoke of the attention which its members had devoted to the matter, and asked whether it was not better to stand bv their recommendation than risk an experiment by departing from it. He seems to forget that the Government brought forward a proposal which embodied the recommendation of the Tariff Commission majority, and that they are now proposing to depart from it. It seems to&#39; me that this Committee desires to encourage the formation of  a combine. Some honorable members admit that a- margin of 6d. per lb. would be ample to enable the large houses operating in tobacco to make substantial profits. But they affirm that if that margin were adopted, we should close up the small manufacturers. In other words, the small factories are to be kept open by a combination of prices between the small men and the large men. That is what exists to-day. In order to keep the small men going, honorable members ask for a difference of <inline font-style="italic">gd.</inline> per lb. in favour of the local producer, and for nothing less. Thus the action of this Committee is in the direction of creating a combine. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member&#39;s statement is quite wrong. Ninepence per lb. was the margin there. I favour the proposal of the honorable member for Angas, because I consider that the present import duty is a sufficient tax upon the consumer of tobacco. I am not in favour of piling up taxes to the extraordinary degree that is proposed in this Tariff. I further favour the amendment because it will not disturb the trade. </para>

                                <para>- It is disturbed by these Tariff proposals. But it will have to be &#39;further disturbed when we depart from the old rates. Tobacconists are in the habit of selling plug tobacco for an even coin, and any alteration in the old rates of duty will necessitate the introduction of new machinery and the adoption of a different sized plug by importers or manufacturers. Then I am opposed to differentiating between stemmed and unstemmed tobacco. According to the statement of the Minister, in order to make the distinction proposed, the people of Australia will be called upon to pay taxation to&#39; the extent of ^90,000 annually. Even if that differentiation did result in  the employment of 700 additional hands, which I very much doubt, the amount indicated would be more than sufficient to pay their wages. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member himself set down the extra cost of stemming here at 4&#163;d., and the Minister estimated it at  3d.  per lb. Upon the assumption that it costs only  3d.  per lb., the differentiation between stemmed and unstemmed tobacco would mean a loss to the consumers of  ,&#163;90,000  annually. The Minister has stated that the proposal of the honorable member for Angas would show a smaller difference in favour of Australian leaf than that of &#34;the Minister&#39;s own proposal. I say that it would be exactly the same difference, because the duty would be is.  6d.  per lb. on the imported unstemmed leaf in each &#39;case. That is a very high measure of protection. It is ridiculous to assert that any sensible maker would not use as much local leaf as he could, when by so doing he would not be called upon to pay is. fid. per lb.&#34; by way of duty. An immense proportion of the profits of the Combine must be made out of the difference between the cost of the Australian leaf which they use and the cost with duty of imported leaf. It is idle to say that the Combine does not use Australian leaf for fear of losing its monopoly. If its members can control the immense output of the United States, they can much more easily control the output of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- With Australian leaf I should say. I have some personal knowledge of this matter. Years ago, a firm with which I was con.nected in New South Wales, was applied <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> by some tobacco growers to dispose of a quantity of their leaf. The highest price offered was about 4d. per lb., and&#39; this the growers declined to accept ; and then, though my firm was not in the tobacco trade, we offered, as the growers were friends, to advance money on the leaf, and allow them to test its value in the British market. When a sample was sent Home, however, the highest price obtainable was 2 1/2d. per lb., and the experts there said that the leaf was of inferior quality and badly cured. A similar experiment was tried by the New South Wales Government a few years ago, and on that occasion it was found that the price of the leaf in the English market was lower than in New South Wales. </para>

                                <para>- I do not . know anything of that tobacco; I am speaking only of the folly it would be on the part of any business men to refuse u good article produced locally,  when they could obtain it without the necessity of paying a duty of is.  &#39;6d.  per lb. I hope, I believe, that good tobacco will eventually be grown in Australia. As yet, however, we do not know sufficient of the capabilities of our soils and climate in this respect, and there must be experiments. </para>

                                <para>- No doubt the best market will be in Australia. Commonsense tells us that the reason that tobacco leaf grown in Australia has not secured greater use, is that the manufacturers cannot, with satisfaction to their customers, use more than a certain proportion. It would have been infinitely wiser on the part of the Government to adopt the old Tariff. But the Government, after accepting the Tariff Commission&#39;s report, introduce a new system, which gives practically the same margin as the old duties, Which are those proposed by the honorable member for Angas, and yet they make a departure from the old duties, and give rise to much consequent disturbance of trade and manufacture. </para>
