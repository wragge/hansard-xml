                        <para>- I notice that in a schedule of duties which has been put before honorable members, items appear as having been recommended in reports signed by the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission, which would lead one to believe that in every case he signed for the whole of the members of the &#34; A &#34; or protectionist section, whereas in some cases he signed for himself alone, and his opinion was dissented from by the other protectionist members of the Commission. Is the Minister aware of that, and if so, will he have the schedule corrected? </para>

                        <para>- I shall be glad if the honorable member will give notice of his question. While I am ready to give all information possible, my officers cannot determine what was in the minds of the members of the Tariff Commission. They must go by the statements which have been put into cold type in the reports of the Commission. Those reports have been analyzed by them, and the complaint having been made that their analysis was not quite correct, it was gone through again, and several small mistakes corrected. I am at a loss to know how we can do what the honorable member wishes. Honorable members are in possession of the reports of the Tariff Commission, and could, I take it, analyze them for themselves. </para>

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General stated recently that he is desirous of increasing the postal and telegraphic facilities of outlying districts; but yesterday I received a letter from my electorate in which it was stated that the Department has taken from the public the right to telegraph money orders through the post office at Mangana. In doing so, I think that it is taking conveniences from the public, instead of increasing their facilities of communication. </para>

                        <para>The change in practice referred to in the attached letter addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Starrer</inline> was due to a general instruction issued to all  Deputy  Postmasters-General. Recently frauds were perpetrated on the Department in connexion with telegraph money orders, and it became necessary for the Department to take special measures to prevent, as far as practicable, the possibility of further frauds. Experience has shown that, notwithstanding all the precautions taken by the Department; it is impossible to completely prevent fraud in connexion with the telegraph money order system, but there would be absolutely no such preventive at all in connexion with money order messages by telephone, as of course there is no record of such messages which can be verified. The Department is desirous of rendering every reasonable facility to the public, and the recent change of practice was only made because it was found to be necessary in order to protect the public revenue. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not intend to occupy the attention of the Committee to the extent that some previous speakers have occupied it, but I desire to ask the favorable consideration of a few facts which I shall place before honorable members. The first fact to which I desire to invite attention is that since the consummation of Federation three appeals have been made to the electors of Australia. Upon each occasion the question of Free-trade <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> Protection has been submitted for their consideration. As the result of the first election it was found absolutely impossible to secure anything like an effective policy of protection because of the need for regard being paid to revenue considerations. Upon the second occasion the fiscal issue was made a more prominent question, and the electors were invited to declare whether they desired a revenue Tariff or whether they preferred a national policy of protection. The result of the second appeal to the people showed that the number of electors in favour of a protective system had largely increased. Upon the last occasion a deliberate attempt was made to cloud the fiscal issue, and to this end the champion of free-trade in Australia - the leader of the Opposition - abandoned his free-trade principles for the time being, and raised the flag of anti-Socialism. Many of his. followers in other parts of the Commonwealth ranged themselves under that banner. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the Committee would expect the honorable member to abandon his free-trade principles. I believe that he is one of the few real free-traders in this Chamber who desire to abolish the whole of the Customs and Excise duties, and to obtain whatever revenue may be necessary for the government of the Commonwealth by means of direct taxation. He has repeatedly declared himself in favour of that policy. But he is evidently determined to whittle down the duties imposed upon the various items in the Tariff schedule to the lowest possible point. I do not quarrel with him for the attitude which he takes up, because I recognise that he is a sincere free-trader who wishes to assert his principles upon every possible occasion. But, although the cry of anti-Socialism was raised at the last election in New South Wales, can anybody deny that the real issue before the electors was the fiscal issue? </para>

                            <para>- I say that from every platform in this State candidates affirmed that they were in favour of a policy of protection. , Now, what the people of Australia want is an effective measure of protection - a Tariff which will have the effect of increasing the industries in our midst and of providing our artisans with opportunities to obtain a fair and legitimate wage. When we come to deal with the separate items of the schedule, I intend to afford those honorable members who  from the hustings declared themselves protectionists a chance to justify their position before the electors. </para>

Fortunately for Australia protectionists desire legislation in the interests of the masses, and not in those of the classes. New South Wales has always claimed to be a free-trade State. Whilst the honorable member for Parramatta was speaking the other day, he appeared to resent the suggestion which I made that New South Wales was never a free-trade State. </para>

                            <para>- What I say is that it is absolutely impossible to refuse to carry into effect the Australian policy which has been demanded by the people. For example, can it be denied that the fiscal question was raised during the recent elections in New South Wales? Was the question of the Tariff not dragged in by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> for purposes of his own - an action which in my opinion has proved very disastrous to him? Does not the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the great free-trade journal of Melbourne, in compiling the returns of the New South Wales elections, not class the successful candidates as protectionist-liberals and free-trade-liberals? Under the circumstances, I ask in all seriousness what justification there is for the threats of the Opposition that they intend to try their utmost to reduce the duties below the protective line? The people have three times loudly demanded from us, as their representatives, a truly protective policy ; and the Opposition, if they take the action they have foreshadowed, will be acting treacherously towards the country. We are here to reflect the opinions of the people, since we claim to be a democracy ; and, therefore, no good ground can be shown for any effort that may be made to confine the Tariff to revenue duties. </para>

Only on Tuesday last, in New South Wales, the protectionists of that State, particularly in Sydney and suburbs, spoke out so emphatically that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> lost no fewer than seven seats in the County of Cumberland. </para>

                            <para>- Protection. The Tariff is introduced avowedly to give as much protection as possible to the people of Australia. Unfortunately, while the Braddon section remains in operation, it is absolutely impossible to secure a perfectly true and scientific protectionist policy, seeing that revenue considerations prevail, and many items of a revenue character must remain on the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- No. As a protectionist, I say that if it were not for the fact that revenue must be obtained from Customs and Excise, and from that source only during the operation of the Braddon section, I would vote against every duty imposed for revenue purposes. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with the Braddon section immediately ; and in the meantime will only say that I think its removal would make a difference. However, the fact remains that we derive all our revenue at the present time from Customs and Excise alone. Three-fourths of that revenue we are compelled by the Constitution to return to the States, but, as a matter of fact, we have returned more than the stipulated proportion. However, that is also a matter with which I shall deal later. The position has to be faced as we find. it. The Government and their supporters, and, I believe, every member in this House, will admit that consideration must be given to the revenue requirements of the Commonwealth in the framing of the Tariff ; and consequently we find certain items which, but for that consideration, would not have been there. </para>

I know that the honorable member for Barrier, with whom I have had many pleasant conversations on the subject, is a believer in the writings of Henry George. I also believe in that portion of Henry George&#39;s writings, wherein it is laid down that there is no justification whatever for a Tariff except for protective purposes - wherein he condemns any imposition of duties for revenue purposes. </para>

                            <para>- That is another matter on which I do not desire to touch at present. However, when the  question of direct taxation is introduced here, I do not think there will be much difficulty in finding out what my opinions and intentions are on the subject. At present I am dealing with the Tariff from the point of view I have indicated. I hold that a Tariff ought to be for protective purposes only, and that for the purposes of revenue other taxation arrangements should be made. </para>

                            <para>- The arrangements which the honorable member for Dalley would like to make are not of a character to suit my purpose. It is apparent that education is spreading, and has actually reached the honorable member for Dalley, whom I recognise and welcome as a convert to protection. The honorable member has hitherto been a follower of Cobden, but he has announced to the House - and I compliment him on his action - that he intends to vote for the highest form of protection in the case of the manufacture of iron and steel and&#34; the building of ships. I can assure the honorable member that he will find me by his side on every occasion in which he endeavours to carry out his purpose. </para>

                            <para>- The Tariff has been dealt with by many honorable members during this discussion. I am somewhat disappointed at some honorable members who declared themselves protectionists to the people of Australia, but who, in this House, have enunciated so peculiar a kind of protection. An attempt has been made by one honorable member - I think the honorable member for Grampians - to draw a line at what he calls effective protection, and the honorable member in his remarks declared that he could not go beyond that line, because it meant prohibition. I am very curious to know where the line is to be drawn. If you ask the  deputy  leader of the Opposition, he will say that the line should be drawn at 10 per cent., whereas other honorable members declare for1 5 per cent, or even 25 per cent. </para>

I also have a few, but the difference between the honorable member and myself is that he cannot substantiate his facts, whereas I can substantiate mine. Without going into dry statistics, I wish to compare the position of Victoria under a protective policy with the position of the larger State of New South Wales under freetrade. Can any one deny that the protective policy has established industries and given employment to thousands in Victoria ? </para>

                            <para>- That was after the collapse of the boom, with which the honorable member, among others, had something to do. Victoria is only one-fourth the age of New South Wales, but under her protective policy she fostered and encouraged the producing interests to such an extent as to put on the soil fourteen producers to the square mile as against only three producers to the square mile in New South Wales. In the one State a domestic policy prevailed, whilst in the other there was a foreign policy in operation. I hope that honorable members listened to-day to the reply given by the Acting Prime Minister to my question as to the countries from which the wire-netting imported into Australia comes. Do those imports come from our &#39;kith and kin in the old land? </para>

                            <para>- I have not the figures by me. We often hear New South Wales referred to as &#34; the parent State.&#34; As a matter of fact, she is not. No one can say that she is the parent of South Australia, but we may properly speak of her as &#34; the senior State.&#34; She enjoyed constitutional government long before the other States, and she possesses the greatest gifts that God could shower upon a country - rich mineral deposits, the finest harbor in the world, and magnificent shipping facilities. But almost until the present time she has relied, not upon the energy and industry of her producers to develop her vast resources, but upon a policy of borrowing from the money-lender abroad. </para>

                        <para>Victoria has been under a protective tariff for many years, and the. result of that protective tariff is that thousands of pounds worth of articles which come in here through our ports never come in through Victoria&#39;s ports at all, because they are either produced or manufactured in Victoria. Now supposing for one moment that when the Federal Parliament meets, the average tariff of Australia, which may be called the Victorian tariff, is adopted, you will see clearly that this colony (N.S.W.) having been for many years under a free trade system, must take years before it works out the result of a protective system. Even if you introduce a high tariff at once, you will not rush into existence manufactures of .all kinds, and you will not make people produce all kinds of articles which they have hitherto had imported. </para>

                    <para class="block">This expression of opinion on the part of a gentleman whose views are worthy of serious consideration fully corroborates my statement concerning the value of protection. I do not think that any honest politician would attempt to deny its accuracy. There is no reason why we should cavil at such a statement. I am as loyal to New South Wales as is any honorable member, and when I know what protection has done for Victoria I feel that the policy is one that should be applied, not only to New South Wales, but to the whole Commonwealth. When a protective Tariff is introduced, certain honorable members immediately threaten to do their utmost to prevent its being passed. </para>

                            <para>- They often are. The honorable member&#39;s party regard the importers as demigods. They claim that they alone should be considered, and that with unrestricted imports we should have lower prices. But what have the importers been doing since the imposition of the new Tariff? Many of them have been absolutely robbing the people of Australia by raising the prices of articles that have not been subjected to an increased duty. </para>

                            <para>- I certainly wish to grant protection to the manufacturer, but my vote will also be cast in the direction of allowing the artisan and the mechanic to participate in the advantages of such a policy. Since the imposition of the new Tariff we have had an all round increase in prices. The honorable member for Parkes has quoted a paragraph setting forth that, in consequence of the Tariff, household expenses have been increased by 3s. per week. </para>

Is it not a fact that the Australian retailer, in many instances, has raised the prices of articles that are produced in Australia, and on which no duty has been paid ? Is it not true that we are told that the price of everything has been increased in consequence of the Tariff? Are honorable members blind? Are they not aware that we have on the free list hundreds of articles? </para>

I describe them as&#34; commercial robbery.&#34; No tradesman or merchant has a right to call upon the general public to pay something that he himself has not had to pay. I hope that we shall pass legislation dealing with those who mislead and rob the public in the way to which I have referred. I should like to know what justification there is for the increase of9d. per lb. in the price of tobacco. We have imposed a further duty of 3d. per lb. </para>

Then, again, the price of kerosene has been increased, although under the Tariff a duty is imposed only on the cases and tins in which kerosene is introduced. The British Imperial Company has intimated  that it has not increased the price of its kerosene to the retailers, and that it does not intend to do so; but yet in almost every shop an increase of 3d. per gallon is charged. Is not that robbery? </para>

                            <para>- It is not a theory; it is a fact that has been demonstrated. The theory of the free-trade party is that if goods can be purchased in foreign countries at low prices and introduced into Australia free of duty, the consumers will obtain them at a very low price. If consumers could go to other parts of the world for what they want, and buy there, they would undoubtedly purchase cheaply; but they cannot do that, and have to buy from importers whose profit is, not  10  per cent., but often1,000 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- No. The true protectionist recognises that, under free-trade, the importer has a monopoly of distribution, and can make the consumers pay whatever prices he chooses to ask; that, therefore, in the interests of the community, local manufacturers should be encouraged to create competition, compelling importers to reduce prices in order to retain the market. Will the honorable member deny that, from the initiation of protection in Victoria until the present day, the prices of all kinds of articles have been lower than they were before the protective policy was adopted? </para>

The gambling in land by a section of the community ruined many thousands, including unfortunate widows ; but the policy of protection has always created employment in Victoria. We had a financial smash in New South Wales, due to gambling there, and if the Government of the State had not come to the assistance of the local banks not one of them could have kept its doors open. However, these are matters which, although not entirely foreign to the question, are not directly connected with it. I am glad to have had an opportunity to expose the dishonest practices of many of our traders in increasing prices unjustifiably, and I have rightly termed their action robbery. It has been said that the imposition of a high Tariff will create in Australia monopolies, combines, rings, and trusts. But if the Tariff has that effect, this Parliament can legislate to remedy the evil. We cannot deal with the huge octopus-like corporations which are sucking the life blood of the commercial world, and already have their tentacles on Australia, declaring that they will destroy our local manufactures ; but we can legislate to break up such institutions if they establish themselves within the Commonwealth. If it were found that legislation could not properly control private enterprise, I would vote for the nationalization of industries. The Tariff, which  I  hope will be passed without much alteration, provides for the protection of all classes. It protects the producers of wool and cereals-- </para>

                            <para>- The producers can watch the local markets, and hold back for good prices; but in outside markets they are at the mercy of rings and trusts, which so arrange prices that they are compelled to accept their terms. Our farmers are, to some extent, protecting themselves by building stores, in which they can keep back their wheat until they can get a reasonable price for it. I speak from long experience when I say that protection benefits the producer. It secures to him the home market, giving him better prices, and it does not  deprive him of the right to send his surplus to a foreign market Queensland was absolutely protectionist, so far as the sugar industry was concerned, imposing an import duty of&#163;6 a ton and no Excise. The effect of that policy has been to put the Queensland sugar growers in the proud position of being able to supply the Australian market. What Queensland has done in regard to the sugar industry we desire that the Commonwealth shall do in regard to all other industries. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members speak of desiring to whittle down the Tariff because this man and that should not get. protection; but they are unanimously of opinion that the Queensland sugar industry should be protected. In Brisbane, with several other honorable members, I had a conversation with a gentleman holding a high position in connexion with the sugar industry. He boldly asserted that the white man could not do the work required in the plantations, and that the industry would be destroyed unless we abandoned the policy which we had initiated. Thereupon, I asked him what wages he paid weekly to white men engaged in the plantations.  His  reply was &#34;Twenty-five shillings.&#34;&#39; I then inquired, &#34; How long do you employ them ?&#34; to which he replied &#34;Two or three months.&#34; I further asked him, &#34;What food do you give them?&#34; He gave me the information, and added that they complained of the quality of the food, and even wanted to be supplied with jam. I then asked, &#34;What employment do you give them during the remaining nine months of the year ?&#34; to which he replied, &#34; No employment whatever.&#34; I informed him that there was not a farmer in the eastern and southern States who would not regard himself as a mean man if he offered an agricultural labourer less than 30s. a week with good food at harvest time. </para>

                            <para>- I am not hitting at the honorable member. My remarks apply particularly to one or two representatives of Victoria. To the honorable member for Parkes, who interjected just now, I wish to put this question: Why should members of the legal profession claim the right to charge high prices for their services whilst at the same time denying to those engaged in industrial pursuits an opportunity to procure a reasonable return for their services? Our artisans have nothing but their labour to offer, and they have a right to demand something more than a mere existence - some little pleasure, as well as leisure. </para>

I listened attentively to his speech the other evening, and I inferred from his remarks that the highest duties which he was inclined to support were those which have been recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. </para>

                            <para>- I know nothing of the kind. Need I remind the honorable member of what happened the other day ? Almost everybody professes to be in favour of the establishment of the iron and steel industry in Australia. Differences of opinion exist as to the means by which it should be established - as to whether it should be encouraged by the granting of a bonus or by the imposition of a protective duty, or as to whether it should be nationalized. But the feeling undoubtedly exists that it ought to Le established, and we know that an attempt has been made to establish it. The honorable member for Parkes is well aware that Lithgow is a place which offers special advantages for the establishment of the iron industry on account of the coal and lime deposits in the vicinity. He also knows that in the past large sums have been expended there in an attempt to establish the iron industry, and that those efforts have failed. . My own opinion is that their failure was due to the fact that a combination of importers had determined that the industry should not be established, and had so contrived to control prices as to crush it out of existence. At <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford&#39;s</inline> works at the present time there is a large stock of pig-iron on hand. Only the other day South Australia wanted a few thousand tons of that class of iron. To secure the order the Sandford Proprietary reduced the cost of that iron to an amount which was only just sufficient to cover its actual production. But what did the importers do? They at once contrived to reduce the price of pig- iron below the cost of production. In order to kill the industry, they actually sold the iron for considerably less than they had sold it for previously, and for less than they  have demanded for it since. </para>

                            <para>- The importers. This is not merely a question of a few pounds ; it means importations to the value of about &#163;7,000,000  per  annum. We ought to&#39; strive by every means in our power - I care not how, so long as the end is attained - to establish this industry within the Commonwealth, and we should not cavil at the amount of the duty. In a national work of this kind if 20 per cent, should not prove&#39; enough, we ought to impose 40 per cent., and if that should prove insufficient, then let us charge 100 per cent. ; we ought to impose a duty sufficiently high to give to the people the benefit of the establishment of this industry. I hope, and, indeed, I - am sure that I have been fair to the honorable member with whose remarks I am now dealing. The honorable member said that for the first year of the Tariff the revenue returned would be large, but that in the next year it would decrease, and in the following year would decrease still more, until it amounted to no more than &#163;9,000,000 per annum. Under the Braddon section we are compelled to return to the States three-fourths of the revenue, which, with a total revenue of &#163;9,000,000, would mean &#163;6,750,000, retaining only something like &#163;t. 750, 000 for Federal purposes. On this point, the honorable member absolutely recommended that, even with a revenue of &#163;9,000,000, we should return to the States &#163;7,250,000 or &#163;1,000,000 more than they are at present receiving.  His  ground for this recommendation is that the present return is not enough to enable the States t&#39;o meet their financial demands ; and he pointed out that &#163;7,250,000 is the amount required to meet the interest on the debts. </para>

                            <para>- And does the Commonwealth not require the money ? It is all very well to be generous, but the Commonwealth Parliament was established for the purpose of achieving a great national ideal. One great and important duty laid upon us is to defend the Commonwealth against aggression. The honorable member for Flinders recognised the necessity for effective defence, and also admitted that the time might come when there would have to be railway communication connecting all the States. But what did the honorable member propose in order that these great works may be carried out? Did he suggest that we should depend on our own resources? No. He suggested that we should follow the bad example of the States in the past_, and by resorting to the money market lay a further burden of interest on t&#39;he people. The Commonwealth Parliament, at its very inception, rightly determined  that the Commonwealth should live within its revenue - that the people of Australia, and those who import goods, should provide the necessary moneys for the carrying out of Commonwealth undertakings. In my opinion, the sentiments expressed on this point by the honorable member for Flinders were not patriotic; and I must say that I expected something better from him than a recommendation to adopt a borrowing policy. If his suggestion were carried out, it would mean that the Commonwealth &#39;would acknowledge itself as subordinate to the States ; and that is not what the Commonwealth was created for - it was created to be supreme. The people of Australia were dissatisfied with the States Parliaments, and they determined that the greater national undertakings and works should be under the control of a central authority. </para>

We should not be just to the people of Australia if we acted towards the States in the manner suggested by the honorable member for Flinders. If we were to return to the States even twice as much of the revenue as we return to them now, the result would not be economy within the States, but only greater extravagance than in the past. In connexion with this phase of the question I should like to give a few figures relating more particularly to New South Wales, with the public life of which State I have been connected for over a quarter oT a century. When Federation was initiated the indebtedness of the </para>

The interest on the whole of the indebtedness amounted to &#163;7,254,948 per annum, the amount, as I observed before, which the honorable member for Flinders urged should be returned to the States out of the prospective reduced revenue of ,&#163;9,000,000. Since Federation the State of New South Wales has increased her indebtedness by &#163;21,867,587, while the indebtedness of the rest of Australia has been increased by &#163;20,000,000 odd, a total of &#163;41,000,000 odd. The interest on the additional debt of the whole of Australia is practically &#163;1,500,000, of which .&#163;774,772 is borne by New South Wales. In pre-Federation days, when New South Wales had to bear the burden of the Post and Telegraphs, and other Departments which have since been transferred to the Commonwealth, she could live, and live well, with a revenue -of &#163;9,000,000. That State, however, was continually borrowing, &#39; and although, since Federation was established the revenue has increased by ,&#163;2,000,000, her finances are still in the same condition as before, and no attempt whatever .is made in the direction of retrenchment. Why should the Commonwealth return more revenue to New South Wales, seeing that, while several costly Departments have been transferred, the revenue of the State is  ;&#163;i  1,000,000-? </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking more particularly of the State of New South Wales. There is a provision in the Constitution by which if Queensland, Tasmania, or any of the smaller States where the population is not large, experience financial difficulties, the Commonwealth may be generous if it chooses by making up any deficiency. What would have been the position of Queensland had we retained the whole of the one-fourth of the revenue to which we were entitled? </para>

                            <para>- The statement made by the honorable member for Parkes is, up to a certain point, correct. We have not restricted the power of the States to introduce desirable white immigrants; but we have restricted their power to introduce the kanaka or other inferior races. We were elected for that purpose, amongst others ; the Constitution gave us power to deal with the question of immigration. </para>

                            <para>- The great heart of the people of the Commonwealth favoured a White Australia. We determined to restrict the powers of the States in regard to immigration, because some of them had introduced inferior races, and we declared that, after a certain reasonable time had elapsed, Australia should be white. We wished to preserve the purity of our race, and to keep our people from the degradation of inferior races. </para>

                            <para>- We must agree to differ with respect to that question. I am as anxious as is any honorable member that the population of Australia should be increased by means of an effective immigration policy, but I wish immigrants of the right class to be introduced. I do not wish to suggest that any of the representatives of Queensland in this House were responsible for incidents to which I am about to refer, but, when a young man, I was in Queensland, and was shocked by some of the proceedings associated with the introduction of black labour into that State. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to labour this question. The old regulations providing for the introduction of kanaka labour seemed on the surface to be fair and reasonable. They provided that kanakas who volunteered to come to Queensland should be recruited. But we cannot deny that kidnapping of the worst description took place in the old days, and would take place again to-morrow if certain people had their way. </para>

                            <para>- I propose now to deal with the statement made by the honorable member for Flinders with regard to the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. The honorable member said that we should shortly be face to face with a reduced revenue of &#163;9,000,000 per annum, and that of that sum we should have to return , &#163;7,250,000 to the States, retaining the balance to provide for the government of the Commonwealth. It would be absolutely impossible for the Commonwealth to carry on with such a revenue. Justifiable expenditure will of necessity increase as the years roll by. I have from the first opposed the policy of borrowing, and I still do so. My desire is that the Commonwealth shall live within its means ; but we cannot carry out the works which the people of Australia demand if we have to treat the States in the way suggested by the honorable member for Flinders. Parliament has voted &#163;20,000 for the survey of a transcontinental railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, and I believe that we shall ultimately approve of the construction of that line. Indeed, to properly provide for the defence of Australia, railways will have to be connected with every important strategic point in the Commonwealth, so that men, guns, and ammunition may be conveyed rapidly from place to place as occasion may require. </para>

The honorable member will admit that there must be further expenditure in extending our postal and telegraphic services. He has asked me how provision is to be made for this expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Flinders would provide for the expenditure which he thinks necessary by borrowing, and by retrenchment in connexion with the Public Service increments; I am against both. My opinion is that the people, in voting for the Constitution, approved of the Braddon section, recognising that a period of ten years should be given to the States in which, to put their houses in order, and decided that at the end of that period the total Customs and Excise revenue should be under the control of the Commonwealth . </para>

                            <para>- My view is that when the Braddon section expires, it should not be resuscitated, and, personally, I shall vote for the retention by the Commonwealth of the whole of the revenue from Customs and Excise. If we are to be content with one-fourth of that revenue, and are not to borrow, we shall be forced to impose direct taxation on the property owners of Australia. I think that in 1910 a majority will agree with me that the Commonwealth should then control the whole of the Customs and Excise duties, retaining what is necessary for the Commonwealth, and dividing the balance among the States equitably. </para>

                            <para>- I wish I were. If honorable members will not permit the Commonwealth to control the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue, as I have indicated, they must vote for direct taxation. The making of preparations for defence is a sacred duty; but it will entail a large expenditure. I have not referred to other items of expenditure, such as that connected with the building of a Capital, which is not urgent. In saying that the building of a Capital is not urgent, I am not disloyal to my State, though to some of the representatives of New South Wales the making of such a statement would be like the waving of a red rag in front of a bull. The building of the Federal Capital can be allowed to wait without injury to the people of Australia. They are not injured by the meeting of Parliament elsewhere than in the Federal Capital, but they will be seriously injured if we do not make adequate provision for defence. We have been told that it is disloyal to talk about making provision for our own defence. We have been told that it is disloyal to talk in this way, and that we ought to depend for our defence upon the mother country. Is it disloyal, I ask, to refuse to &#34;loaf&#34; upon the old land? </para>

                            <para>- Is not Australia part of the Empire? Surely we shall be helping the old country to defend the Empire if we relieve her of the responsibility of defending Australia? Though I am of Australian birth, I am as loyal to the mother land as is  any  of her native born. &#34; God helps those who help themselves,&#34; and surely that axiom will apply to Great Britain as well as to ourselves. To rely upon our annual contribution to the Imperial Navy to provide us with an effective defence is the acme of absurdity. We must recollect that we have a coast line of many thousands of miles to defend, and that we need a navy to defend it. </para>

When that vessel is constructed I say that we should build another, and then another, until we have formed a squadron possessed of sufficient strength to hold a foe at bay until the mother country could come to our assistance. Even- if an expenditure of millions sterling be involved, we must be prepared to provide the Commonwealth with an effective defence. Australia demands that we shall carry. out our pledges. </para>

                        <para>.- We have heard a great deal about the time which has been absorbed by this debate, and possibly some honorable members who have spoken may have occupied a little longer than they need have done. But in this connexion it should be clearly recognised that we are dealing not with one subject, but&#39; with two very large questions. If a separate debate had taken place upon the Tariff, it would have terminated within a week. Personally. I dp not think that the time which has been spent in discussing the Budget and the Tariff has been altogether wasted. We must recognise that the financial proposals of the Government constitute the crux of the situation. I do not intend to deal at any length with those proposals, but I do think - notwithstanding the criticism which has been levelled against us in regard to the length of the debate - that every member should be prepared to state his position and to emphasize any points which require emphasis without being open to the accusation that he is wasting time. Before I deal with the Tariff proposals, I should like to refer to certain remarks of the honorable member for Riverina in regard to the Queensland sugar industry. I think that he has entirely misunderstood the position which I took up by means of interjections from this side of the Chamber. He distinctly led us to suppose that in Queensland there was a large number of people who were not&#39; only in favour of black labour, but who desired to revert to the old system of kidnapping - of unregulated black labour. I  say  that if representation in Parliament means anything, the people of Queensland have conclusively shown that they are opposed to black labour in  any  form. That State returned to this House, at the last election, a large majority of representatives belonging to the party which made the abolition of black labour its election cry. It is idle to deny it. </para>

                    <para class="block">Doubtless some of us thought that the industry could not be carried on by means of white labour, even if it were protected. But in holding that belief we were wrong. It has Been proved that white men - at any rate south of Mackay can perform the work required of them in the cane-fields. As long as the industry receives protection, and as long as it can hold our home market, all may be well. But I do not think that Queensland should feel under any particular obligation to the Commonwealth. I do not think that she should be taunted with having received a special benefit in the form of the sugar bounty. It must be recognised that the industry was of enormous importance to the State. It had been carried on for years. After Federation was accomplished the people of Australia, in the interests of the nation, said, &#34; We must abolish the black labour which enables you to compete with the rest of the world.&#34; Surely under such circumstances it was only fair that the same people should say to Queensland, &#34; We do not intend to destroy your industry, and therefore we propose to grant you  special  consideration.&#34; I admit that the Commonwealth has not treated Queensland ungenerously in this matter, but I object to certain honorable members taunting that State with- the special treatment which the sugar industry has received. </para>

                            <para>- It may be so. I do not know. and J do not think that the honorable member for Riverina knows, how many electorates there are in which that was .the case. Certainly it was not the case in Queensland. I was pledged to fiscal peace and to the removal of any anomalies that existed under the old Tariff. I declared that I would not assist to alter that Tariff in the direction of either freetrade or protection, except within the limits I have indicated. That is my position. I confess that I could not follow the argument of the honorable  member  for Riverina that the present high Tariff protects all industries, including that of the primary producers. It certainly does not appear to do so, bearing in mind the outcry which has arisen from every mining and farming centre in Australia. The honorable member affirmed that it protected our primary industries by creating a large local market for their produce. </para>

                            <para>- In a country like America, with a population of 80,000,000, it is true that the home market, to a large extent, absorbs the produce of the primary industries. But that is not so. in Australia. Our market for our butter and our wheat is entirely dependent upon foreign prices. Irrespective of  whether  we have a policy of high protection, of low protection, or, indeed, of no protection whatever, so far as our secondary industries are concerned, the prices of our butter and our wheat will not be affected. In regard to those commodities we have to depend entirely  upon the  London market. &#39; <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                            <para>- I am simply dealing with one phase of the argument adduced by the honorable member for Riverina. I cannot see how a high protective Tariff will benefit the primary  producer. On the contrary, it must inevitably handicap him by raising the prices of all the articles which he uses. I have already told the Committee that I am pledged to a fiscal truce. But, personally, I am quite prepared to grant to industries such a measure of protection as will equalize the wages paid in foreign countries and those paid in Australia. It seems to me that, if we deal with dumping, the natural protection which our industries enjoy should be sufficient to adequately protect them. If we go further than that, it appears to me that for the sake of a few operatives and manufacturers we shall be taxing thousands. The honorable member for Riverina appears to be absolutely mad upon the question of protection. He declares that when once we initiate a system of protective duties it does not matter if we levy imposts amounting to hundreds per cent. But would the honorable member apply that argument to industries which employ only 200 or 300 men, and produce commodities used by thousands of working people ? </para>

                            <para>- If we could see, straight ahead, a large local market, there might be something in the argument of the honorable member for Riverina. Unfortunately, however, extreme protectionists go further, and tax the primary producer up to the hilt, at the same time declaring that he will benefit by the process. I do not see how the primary producer can benefit under such circumstances. I should like to say a word or two now as to the new protection. High protectionists tell us that when industries have become established under protection prices come down lower than previous to the Tariff, by reason of internal competition. If that be true, I do not know how the unfortunate workers are to fare. We know that under the new protection the workers are very naturally and justly determined to claim as big a share as possible of the enhanced prices. </para>

                            <para>- I shall refer to that matter later on. One is almost afraid to  adversely criticise in any way the Tariff, because the Acting Prime Minister&#34; seems to get so angry. In the last short session, before the Imperial Conference, the honorable gentleman said that he would have plenty of time to study the reports of the Tariff Commission and other documents while travelling between here and England, so that no time would be lost by the prorogation of Parliament. The natural conclusion was that the Tariff when brought down would be a perfect and truly scientific Tariff ; but I do not think the Government can claim that the result is up to expectations. </para>

                            <para>- Then it must have been a very rough passage. However, the question has a very serious side ; and when the Government threw the Tariff on the table in the way in which they did, without saying anything as to its nature, or apparently, without even being seized of the seriousness of the position, they inflicted great injury on the country. That is not the sort of conduct we have the right to expect from the body of men who have the&#39; interests of the Commonwealth within their control. Take only one example, the case of chairs; it is evident that the Minister who dealt with the Tariff never intended that those articles&#39; should be taxed to the extent of 7s. 6d. each on a value of 3s. or 4s. </para>

                            <para>- If so, they will defend it by explaining that they did not mean the recommendation to be taken as interpreted by the Acting Prime Minister. There was the expert advice of the Customs officials at hand, and the Minister ought to have produced a much better result, because I know those officials to be exceedingly able men. The criticism is perfectly just and well-earned that the Minister has evidently shown no consideration for the interests of commerce and trade, or for the welfare of the people, in the introduction of this Tariff. Whatever time may have been wasted in discussing the Tariff here, no time has been wasted in discussing the financial position. The country is indebted to those honorable members who took the trouble to go  into the question very fully - the honorable member for.&#39; Flinders and the honorable member for Kooyong amongst others - and who raised the debate to what I consider a distinctly high plane. I do not agree with the accusation made against those honorable members, that they went out of their way to raise the feelings of the States against the Commonwealth. As to States rights, if an honorable member on this side ventures to say a word in their defence, he is immediately charged with disloyalty to the Federation.- I see no justification for &#39;any such accusation, because when we speak of States rights, we are not referring so much to. the Premier or Government of a particular State, as to the people of the State, who, it must be remembered, are also our electors. If by any action of the Commonwealth Parliament we make it imperative for a State Government to impose heavy burdens on their people, it is we who must be held responsible. At the time of the Premiers. .Conference at Brisbane* most of &#39; the newspapers of Queensland took, perhaps, a rather narrow attitude in connexion with the relations of the Commonwealth and the States. But one particular newspaper, which has great influence in Queensland, took the view that, as the Federal Parliament necessarily had complete control of taxation, would it not be better, instead of making a fuss and raising ill-feeling to simply take the view that the State electors were also the electors of the Federal Parliament, and so throw the whole onus of the situation on  that Parliament ; that if we were the cause of extra burdens on the people, we should be called to account. In my opinion, that was a good position to take up ; because, as I said before, when we on this side offer any criticism as to the attitude of the Commonwealth Government towards the States, we are not dealing with a State in its governmental aspect, but with the people of the State whom we represent, and who are also State electors. The honorable member for Riverina, speaking of the States debts, said he was perfectly satisfied that when the Constitution was framed it was intended that at the end of j910 the Commonwealth should take the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. The honorable member contended that there was no intention that any portion of that revenue should then be returned to the States, or used for the payment of interest on the States debts; but that, on the other hand,  the Commonwealth should take the whole of the money, and use it for Commonwealth purposes, leaving the States to do as best they could. When I heard that remark I procured some figures, in order to arrive at &#39;some idea as to what would be the financial position of the States if that idea of the honorable member for Riverina were carried out. I have not yet had time to look at the figures, and, therefore, do not know how they will bear on my argument; but I think they will be worth recording. Let us suppose that the ten years had expired in 1905-6, when the general revenue of Queensland, exclusive of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise from the Commonwealth, was &#163;2,996,475. The threefourths&#39; which it received from the Commonwealth in that year amounted to &#163;&#34;857,048. The expenditure on administration, &#38;c, excluding interest on the debts, was &#163;2,178,831, while the interest was ,&#163;1,546.881. Excluding from the revenue the three-fourths of the Customs revenue returned, the figures show that Queensland would have been left with a deficit of .&#163;729,237. The idea of the honorable member for Riverina in regard to the retention of the whole of the revenue by the Commonwealth may, for all I know, obtain pretty freely on the other side. I would impress upon the Committee that had the course indicated been followed in 1905-6, Queensland would have had a deficit of about three-quarters of a million. In making such suggestions, honorable members display an utter want of appreciation of our responsibilities to those who, after all, are Federal as well as States electors, and so give rise to the talk of secession which we are all so sorry to hear. They should be more guarded in their statements. </para>

                    <para class="block">It will thus be , seen that the honorable member for South Sydney considers that if we took over the debts of the States the assets represented by those debts should be handed over to us. He would expect to have handed over to the Commonwealth railways, irrigation works, and also, in many cases, works undertaken by local authorities on which borrowed money had been spent. In other words, the honorable member appears to favour unification. It would be impossible for the Commonwealth to assume the control of all local works, as suggested by the leader of the Labour Party, without at the same time undertaking the whole management of the States. That, I think, is absolutely out of the question. It is not provided for in the Constitution. We are endowed with certain powers, and we cannot go beyond them. I fail to understand how the honorable member could take up such a position. Another point which ought to be  remembered in this connexion is that, although a railway may originally have cost  &#163;1,000,000,  its value to the State to-day is much in excess of that sum. I have here a table showing that, from  1901-2  to  1905-6,  the return on capital invested in the State railways of Queensland, was as follows : -  1901-2, &#163;1 8s. 8d.  per cent..; <inline font-style="italic">i9&#176;2-3&#62;</inline> &#163;1  i2S- per cent.;  1903-4, &#163;2  is. id. per cent. ;  1904-5, &#163;2 10s. 2d.  per cent. ; and  1905-6, &#163;2 16s. 5d.  per cent. It will thus foe seen that the return is gradually increasing. What would be the position in regard to a Queensland State railway, constructed ten years ago at a. cost of  &#163;1,000,000,  and the earnings of which had averaged  1&#189;  per cent, below the rate which would pay interest and &#39;redemption? That deficit would have been made good from year to year out of the pockets of the people of Queensland, and would represent a total of  &#163;150,000  in respect of the ten years&#39; period. In other words, such a railway which the honorable member for South Sydney would take over as an asset, representing the original debt of  &#163;1,000,000,  would have cost Queensland  &#163;1,150,000.  Many of the railways of Queensland were constructed thirty years ago, and have shown a heavy deficit, although I am glad to say that that deficit is gradually becoming less. In the case of a railway constructed twenty years ago, at a cost of  &#163;1,000,000,  and worked at an average loss of  2  per cent., Queensland would have had to pay  &#163;400,000  to make good that deficit. </para>

                            <para>- That indirect benefit makes the asset still more valuable. The original cost of a railway does not represent the hard cash actually spent upon it. The fact that a railway is an aid to settlement makes it worth far more to a State than it actually cost to construct. In these circumstances, the argument that we should take over the Tail ways or irrigation works represented by the debts of the States is utterly fallacious. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. To suggest that the assets should follow the debts in this matter is to take up a false position. When the States went on the London money market to raise their loans the moneylenders did not know to what purpose the money was to be devoted. No mention was made of any special asset. The only asset that the money-lenders wanted was the taxable capacity of the people. That &#62;s the only asset of value to those who lend money to a Government. What has happened from time to time in connexion with various republics in South America to whom money has been loaned by European countries? Whenever any difficulty has been experienced in securing the payment of interest or principal no attempt has been made to take possession of the defaulting country or its public works. The control of its Customs and Excise Department has simply been taken over, and in that way satisfaction has been secured. In the case of national debts&#39; the Customs and Excise revenues constitute the only asset. The arguments advanced! by the honorable member for South Sydney and others that, if .the Commonwealth took: over the debts of the States it should also take over the material assets representing those debts is, as I have said, a fallacious one, and seems to be simply a proposal that we should work towards unification. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member considers that unification would be a good thing for Australia. I differ from that view, but cast no reproach upon him. The argument used by the Labour Party that we should take over the assets, as well as the debts of the States, would seem to show that the majority &#39;of that party are working towards unification. They have a perfect right to do so if they can induce the people to fall into line behind them, but  they should  make it clearly known that that is their Intention. The people as a whole do not realize that it is. As to the general financial question, I may say at once that there are  many  honorable members experienced in national- finance who are much better able to deal with it than I am, and therefore I do not propose to discuss it. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie said that the right honorable member for Swan, and others on his side of the House who claim to be in favour of old-age&#39; pensions, but refuse to vote for a Federal land tax, were hypocrites.  I interjected at the time, because I felt that, if the whip cut the right honorable member for Swan, it also cut me. I realize that a system of old-age pensions, to be effective, must necessarily be a Federal one, in order that the disability in respect of state residential qualifications, under which many deserving men and women labour, may be removed. I am not prepared, however, to say that the Federal Parliament should resort, at the present time, at all events, to direct taxation. Whilst it was absolutely right that the national Parliament should be given every power of taxation, since upon it was thrust the whole responsibility of the nation, at the same time it was distinctly stated at the different Conventions, and understood by the people, that the Commonwealth was to rely upon the Customs and Excise duties for its revenue, leaving direct taxation to the States. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. It may be said, in short, that direct taxation is a reserve of taxation. The States have already had to avail themselves of it. In Queensland we have an income tax, in addition to a land tax, imposed by the local governing authorities, and it seems to me that the State will yet have to resort more fully to that method of raising revenue. If the Commonwealth took over the debts of the States as at the inception of Federation, and had to pay the interest upon&#39; them out of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue &#39;now returned to the States, the States themselves would still have to contract further liabilities. It is all very well for the representatives of the smaller States, which are more densely populated than are the others, to talk of paying for new works out of revenue ; but they should not lose sight of the fact that the larger States have a vast and a rich territory to open up by means of railways and other works - railways which for a great many years will not pay interest. It is impossible to develop the country by the expenditure of revenue alone. Therefore, the States must borrow, and paying interest on the borrowed money and not having power to raise indirect taxation, must impose direct taxation. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. All expenditure of the kind improves property. But, in addition to providing the whole of the money required to keep up the roads of the State, Queensland land-owners have to contribute their share to meet the expenditure on railways and other public works. It seems to me that there would be anomalies under the proposal of the Labour Party. Furthermore, I think it unfair to make one section of the &#39;community provide the money necessary for an old-age pensions fund. An income tax would be of wider effect, and would be based on ability to pay. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that ability to pay must be considered in connexion with taxation. But it must be remembered that there is a limit to the direct taxation which can be imposed, and we must be careful not to exhaust the reserves on which the States have to depend for revenue. </para>

                    <para>We all admit the desirability of establishing a Commonwealth old-age pensions fund, but we should not cripple the resources of the States in order to bring it about. There is no proper ground for charging with hypocrisy those who object to the imposition of a land tax to raise money for this purpose. Reverting to the Tariff, to refer to a matter which I omitted to mention just now, I understood the Acting Prime Minister to say the other day that Messrs. Lysaght Brothers, the Sydney manufacturers of wire-netting gave a distinct understanding that they would not increase the price of their goods. </para>

Lysaght Bros., the principal Australian wire-netting manufacturers, were very fully employed prior to the new duties, and of late years it lias been difficult to get any order executed within a shorter time than three or four weeks. Since the proposed Tariff they have advanced their price 2^ per cent., and we also received an advice on the 22nd inst. from their agents advising us that since the Tariff alterations Messrs. Lysaght Bros. &#34; have been overwhelmed with business, and urge all those booking orders to give the utmost limit with  regard to delivery, and to make allowance for any delay in the execution of orders.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- If that is a duty on their raw material an endeavour should be made to remove it. I have no feeling against manufacturers. We should be badly off without them. It is- only human for them not to make out too good a case for themselves. I know that if I wished for a lease of country I should not try to make the transaction appear too advantageous to myself. As for the new protection, of which we have heard so much, I ask if it is likely that persons with money to invest would put it into Australian industries if they are to be controlled, not only in regard to the wages to be paid - which is right enough - but also as to the prices at which they must sell. If manufacturers are to be at the mercy of an irresponsible board, and to be interfered with at every turn, investors will put their money into industries&#39; in other countries where the conditions are more favorable to a profitable return. Another matter to which I wish to refer is the need for making the proceedings of this Parliament more widely known to the people of thi country. In places like the back country of  Queensland  and Western Australia the settlers are hardly in touch with the Federation. The only Commonwealth Department which affects them nearly is the Post Office. They elect a representative once in three years. He goes away to Melbourne, and they hear little of him until he returns. Their newspapers contain practically no report of what is done here. I think, therefore, that the Government might well take into consideration the advisability of providing for the circulation of adequate reports. </para>

                            <para>- I do not suggest that ; but it might be possible to subsidize press reports in some way. In Queensland, at one time, a gentleman of high literary attainments was employed to write a substantial account - not a shorthand report - of the&#39; proceedings of Parliament, with occasional interjections to give it spice and point, and this was handed free to the press, and posted throughout the country. The arrangement came to an end because it was thought that the State could not afford the expense. But I think that the Commonwealth would be justified in incurring it. </para>

                            <para>- We are all Socialists to some extent. I know from my  experi-ence  as an elector, before I became a member of this Parliament, how little the people are in touch with Federation. They have more sympathy with the Government  of their own State, although it may be sometimes wrong, than with the Commonwealth Government and Parliament, of whose .proceedings they know little: I think that what I propose would revive the national spirit, by bringing the people into closer touch with the Federal Parliament, and make Federation more of a success. The Queensland report, of which I have spoken, used to be issued as a broad sheet, and was &#39;delivered free. It is unreasonable to expect the public at large to keep  in touch with our proceedings by reading <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> because not one man in a thousand has time to do that. </para>

                        <para>.- I have a good deal of sympathy with the complaint made by the honorable member for Capricornia in the last part of his speech. I think it would be in the interests of this Parliament and of the Commonwealth if we could arrange to obtain better press reports of our proceedings. But the suggestion of a subsidized press does not meet with my approval, because I think that it necessarily implies a censored press. </para>

                            <para>- Even that suggestion is open to a good deal of objection. I think that, perhaps, something might be done in the direction of cheapening the telegraph rates for press messages. In that way it may be possible to induce the newspapers, especially those in other States, to devote a little more space to the proceedings of this Parliament. To my mind, it is not a desirable thing that in all the States capitals the proceedings of the States Parliaments should occupy more space in the daily newspapers than is devoted to the proceedings of the national Parliament. But I rose chiefly to add my voice to the warning which has been sounded by the honorable member for Flinders in regard to the want of financial policy on the part of the Government. I am willing to admit, with the honorable member for Gippsland, that under ordinary circumstances the Opposition would not be justified in asking the Government to outline their financial policy two years in advance. But under the special circumstances which obtain - and knowing as we do the policy of honorable members who occupy the Labour corner - this Committee is warranted in asking the Government to give honorable members some indication of their position in regard to Federal and State finance. We must recollect that we have to face a steady increase in, Commonwealth expenditure. I do not say that there has been any extravagance on the part of the Commonwealth. But, irrespective of whether or not there has been extravagance, we cannot ignore the fact that we have to face a steady increase of expenditure, which the Government ought to tell us how they propose to finance. In every Department we find the same thing. In many instances  I  admit that this increased expenditure is necessary. Perhaps it is necessary in every case. Upon looking through the Budget, I confess that  I  cannot, at the moment, point to any instance in which  I  think the expenditure should be reduced. But the fact that the increased expenditure is necessary does not make the position less serious, and it certainly behoves the Government, who,  I  understand, are not in favour of direct taxation-- </para>

At the end of 19 10 we shall be face to face with the problem of whether the Braddon section shall be discontinued, and, if not, what shall be substituted for it. As a matter of fact, we are face to face with that problem now, because we must find the solution of it within the next two years. So long as the expenditure of the Commonwealth Government means a reduction in the amounts which the States Treasurers have to spend, so long will captious criticism be levelled at our expenditure - criticism which is not in the best interests either of the States or of the Federation. The honorable member for Gippsland criticised the proposals of the honorable member for Flinders in regard to the reduction of our expenditure, but neglected to suggest anything better as a substitute.  I  do not agree with the suggestion that we should reduce the increments, which were practically promised by the Commonwealth, to the younger officers of our public service. The Commonwealth and the Departments under its control ought not to be conducted in the way that many mercantile and business enterprises are being conducted. We hear a good deal of talk about our declining birthrate, about the need which exists for increasing our population and for encouraging immigration, but, to my mind, there is a very serious state of affairs when we find that many of our financial institutions - instead of encouraging their employes to settle down in life - are doing all that they can to prevent it. As a matter of fact, many - if not all - of the banks carrying, on business in Australia have inserted in the agreements with their employes a clause which forbids them to marry until they are in receipt of a salary of at least &#163;200 per annum. </para>

                            <para>- When the banks insert such a condition in  I  heir agreements with their employes, they ought to see that those who serve them faithfully shall - within a reasonable time - be afforded an opportunity to get married. There is scarcely a bank carrying on business in Australia at the present time in which any employé in the ordinary course of events can get married before he has reached thirty years of age. Some employes are almost grey-haired men before they are in receipt of the salaries stipulated by their employers as the minimum. We do not want that condition of affairs to be reproduced in our Federal enterprises. We ought to see that young men in the Commonwealth service who serve us faithfully are in a position to look forward, within a reasonable time, to settling down in life and acquiring homes of their own. The honorable, member for Riverina made a very peculiar suggestion in regard to the adjustment of the future relations of the Commonwealth to the States. Of course it is very easy - if we look only at one side of the picture - to suggest a remedy for the difficulty. But the remedy suggested by the honorable member would land every State of the Commonwealth in hopeless bankruptcy so far as its own finances are concerned.  His  suggestion is that at the end of 1910 we shall quietly absorb the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue without returning any to the States. He has pointed out that New South Wales possesses a very big surplus, and that the Government of that State propose to reduce taxation. He adds that the New South Wales Parliament can impose a little more taxation to make up the deficiency which would be caused by the </para>

                    <para class="block">Commonwealth appropriating the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. It might be possible, though I think it would be extremely difficult, for New South Wales, by a great stretch of her powers of taxation, to meet her financial necessities without any sum being returned to her by the Commonwealth. We must remember that, in 1906-7, the Commonwealth returned to New South Wales &#163;3,022,351, and out of that money, if we like to put it so, the State had a surplus of &#163;1,493,322. But the proposal of the honorable member for Riverina would mean that New South Wales, instead of having a surplus of about &#163;1,500,000, would have a deficiency of about &#163;500,000.. Last year, Victoria received from the Commonwealth &#163;2,192,340, and that State had a surplus of &#163;812,406, but the proposal of the honorable member would mean that Victoria would have a deficiency of over &#163;1,250,000. In Queensland, where &#163;942,569 was received from the Commonwealth, and where there was a surplus &#176;f ;&#163;396,&#34;5, the proposal would mean a deficiency of at least &#163;546,000. In South Australia, where the amount received from the Commonwealth was &#163;645,121, and where there was a surplus . of about &#163;300,000 - I have not the exact figures - there would be, instead of a surplus, a deficiency of about &#163;345,000. In Tasmania, where &#163;262,293 were received from the Commonwealth, and there was a surplus of &#163;70,060, there would be a deficiency of about &#163;200,000 ; while in Western Australia, where &#163;755,846 was received from the Federation, and where there was a deficiency of &#163;88,728, the proposal would mean the still greater deficiency of over &#163;840,000. A proposal of the kind needs only to be stated iri order to show its absolute impossibility. Another proposal is made by the Labour Party, who tell us straight out that they desire direct taxation- that if there be any deficiency it ought to be made up by resorting to that method of raising revenue. We can understand a proposal, of that sort, but what we wish to know is whether the proposal is indorsed by the Government. We desire to know, as I said before, whether the Government indorse the statement of the Acting Prime Minister -in favour of a land tax, or whether they indorse the statement. of the Prime Minister against a land tax, and, if the latter, what the Government propose to do with reference to the finances of the States and the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Had the honorable member been paying attention, he would have heard me say that, under ordinary circumstances, it might be sufficient for the Government to outline their proposals for the year, but under the special conditions attendant on the early expiration of the operation of the Braddon section, we should, like to have some indication of their policy in regard to this matter. Without going over the arguments so ably put forward by the honorable member for Illawarra, I agree with him&#39; that at the last election the fiscal question was not properly before the electors. In New South Wales, &#34;at any rate, the issue was distinctly as between the policy propounded by the leader of the Opposition and the policy outlined by the honorable member for South Sydney. In none of the New South Wales electorates, with the exception of the two represented by Ministers, were there Ministerial candidates. Except in the Cowper electorate the honorable member who now represents that constituency fought the election as a protectionist, and stated that he was for anti-Socialism, as did also the Minister nf Trade and Customs. Similar conditions prevailed in nearly every other State; the real issue throughout the Commonwealth was not as between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> but between- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson.</inline> That was so even in Victoria, or otherwise how can we account for the fact that so many Victorian members sit on this side, while the Government benches are so sparsely occupied? No one will, I think, deny that honorable members who dictate the policy of the Government were not elected on the fiscal issue. The honorable and learned member for West Sydney - shall I say the lonely member? - likened himself to Macaulay&#39;s New Zealander ; and it is well sometimes to be able to choose one&#39;s own simile. I might have suggested, however, had the honorable and learned member been present, that, perhaps, a pelican in the wilderness might have been abetter illustration. At any rate, the honorable and learned member admit ted that he was not elected on the fiscal issue. It was, to my mind, very strange that the honorable and learned gentleman should be at such pains to object, and show such heat in objecting, to the conduct of the right honorable leader of the Opposition, when he ad,mittedly had pursued a similar course in his own electorate. He pointed out that so far as he was concerned he fought on the labour issue, and sunk his free-trade principles. The honorable and learned member, by some curious mental gymnastics, tried&#39; to show that the right honorable member for East Sydney was responsible for&#39; &#39; the Tariff. However, it is still a fact that, so long as honorable members in the Labour corner vote to keep this Government in power, they must share the responsibility for the legislation introduced by Ministers. </para>

I said at the outset that I considered the secondary industries of great importance, but that the primary industries were of greater concern to us. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has only to look at the number of people employed and the capital invested in each class of industry in order to see, unless his vision is absolutely distorted, that the comparison I am making is a fair one. We hear a great deal about the products of cheap labour. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that question in due course. I wish to remind honorable members that although we may protect the secondary producer - or, in &#187; other words, the manufacturer - from the results and the products of cheap, labour we cannot protect the primary producer in the same manner. We may tax mining machinery, but we cannot alter the price of gold, silver, copper, tin, or even of iron - honorable members of the Labour Party seem to take a keen interest in iron&#39; - upon the markets of the world, and it is in the outside markets that our primary producers find their largest&#39; customers. We must  remember also that there are many low grade ores- which are being worked on so small a margin of profit that the scale is likely to be turned by a very small additional outlay. The Government have shown an almost criminal negligence of the mining industry by imposing heavy taxation upon the machinery used in connexion with it. We cannot increase the price of coal upon the markets of the world, but the Government are trying, by means of taxation, to make it as difficult as .possible for our coal miners to carry on operations.  All the miners&#39; requisites - the safety lamp, upon which his life depends; the powder and the tools which he uses ; as well as his food and clothing are taxed. After we have done all this we say to the miners, * You are at liberty to compete with others if you can.&#34; Our farmers&#39; have to compete with the wheat of Russia and America, and it is of immense importance to us as a nation that we should secure the markets before the Russians learn to apply modern methods and modern machinery to the great steppes which are part of the wheat producing areas of the world. Our farmers, by reason of their distance from the markets of the qld world, by reason of droughts and the expenses of haulage and freight, are at present severely handicapped, and the proposals of the Government to subject them to increased taxation, although within the last twelve&#39; months for the benefit of Hugh McKay and men of that ilk, they have increased the duty upon agricultural machinery, show an absolute want of consideration for them. The attitude of the Ministry towards other industries is the same. Dairy farmers .are face to face with a tax on cream separators and on the wood used for their butter-boxes, whilst those engaged in the pastoral industry are called upon to pay a duty on their wire netting. </para>

                            <para>- It would be of far greater importance to New South Wales to have 10,000 men engaged in rural pursuits than it would be to have 10,000 concentrated in Lithgow. No one can deny the truth of that statement. I am anxious that this phase of the question shall not be overlooked. The Labour Party have been very definite in their statement that they agree with the policy of settling the people on the land, and with that object in view they propose, by means of a graduated land tax, to burst up the big estates. That seems to be a very simple way out of the difficulty, and if I could go with the Labour Party in that direction, I should do so. But the proposal to pile on taxation merely for the purpose of depreciating the value of any one&#39;s property seems to me to savour of class legislation. </para>

                            <para>- As I have already stated, a graduated land tax would be an easy way of removing some of pur financial difficulties, if it were a fair way ; but the fact that it has been proposed, not to obtain revenue, but, as has been said, to burst up the big estates, shows that it is wrong in principle. Even if, as is contended, the State has created the values which it is proposed to tax, it must be remembered that the owners of the land paid for the properties in respect to which those values exist, and to set about to depreciate them in order that they might be resumed for less than their &#39; true market value would be confiscation. The honorable thing to do is what the Governments of the States have done - resume at market values land needed for closer settlement, re-selling it to the people. The transactions of the New South Wales Government in connexion with the resumption and sub-division of four large estates have been very profitable, the profit running into a great . many pounds, and homes have been provided for a great many people. We must all admit that manufacturing adds to the wealth of a. community ; but the experience of other lands shows that the wealth thus created tends to accumulate in a few hands, and that &#39;the concentration of population in towns creates commercial crises and other difficulties. There are also the&#39; troubles connected with the introduction of laboursaving machinery. Machinery is every day becoming more important in connexion with manufactures, lessening the value of human brains, skill, and effort. Within the last fifty years it has in many industries enabled employers to dispense with skilled artizans, and to engage women and children for what have become merely mechanical occupations. These difficulties extend over a larger sphere than is embraced by the fiscal problem. But the point .which I wish to emphasize is that protection accentuates rather than diminishes them. While I am not attempting to depreciate the value of manufactures to a country, I feel bound to point out that it is becoming more and more recognised that a nation&#39;s strength and stability, its prosperity and happiness, depend more largely upon its rural than upon its urban population. The effect of the Tariff will be to bolster up secondary at the expense of primary industries. The honorable member for South Sydney and his followers claim to particularly represent and have in charge the interest of the working classes. I deny that they have a monopoly of such workers. They are in no sense the mouthpiece of all workers, unless it be of such workers as are members of trades unions. The Tariff, instead of helping the working man, must injure him by decreasing the purchasing power of his money. Lists which have been published in the newspapers show that the Tariff has had the effect of considerably reducing the purchasing power of money, so that what formerly could be bought for <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;i</inline> now  costs 23s. The difference may not seem much to some honorable members, but it is considerable to those who have only a small margin to live on. In New South Wales we made a strong fight to secure a free breakfast table for the people, and having won the battle of free-trade, it was a. great sacrifice to forego the fruits of victory in order that Federation might be  accomplished. In doing so, free-traders recognised that the fiscal contest must be fought again on a new battle field. According to the honorable member for South Sydney, the price list issued by Messrs. Anthony Hordern and Sons, Sydney, shows that since the new Tariff was brought in there has been little or no increase in the cost of what are necessaries to the working men.  According to one statement which he made, there has been an increase only in regard, to treacle. He forgot to point out that that firm, and others whose lists he quoted, are honorably fulfilling their promise not to increase their prices until the stocks which they laid in prior to the imposition of the Tariff are exhausted. The other day the Civil Service Cooperative Society of New South Wales published a new price slip, on which this note appears - </para>

                    <para class="block">That note was placed at the head of a list which they issued to their shareholders. Under this new Tariff, almost every article which the working man has to buy - his food and his clothes, for example - are taxed ; consequently their price will be increased. Many industries which it is proposed to bolster up by increased duties were doing very well under the old Tariff. The woollen industry was in a flourishing condition. The Acting Prime Minister chanced to make a reference to the Parramatta Woollen Mills a few days ago. I happen to be a shareholder in those mills, and I am perfectly satisfied with their prospects - although I have not had a dividend for some time. </para>

                            <para>- I am not. I desire to explain the reasons why the shareholders have not received a dividend. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Sparke  one of the leaders of the protectionist movement in New South Wales, explained to the shareholders that the business had been absolutely mismanaged. As a  matter of fact, the former manager was discharged, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Sparke  was appointed in his stead on account of the mismanagement which had taken place. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Sparke  showed the shareholders very many instances in which goods had been sold by contract for actually less than the cost of producing them, without allowing anything for the ordinary warehouse charges. It was pointed out that one contract had been accepted for the supply of 5,000 rugs to the New South Wales Railways &#39; Commissioners. Honorable members who travel backwards and forwards to Sydney each week are still enjoying the comfort of those rugs. They are very good articles indeed. They cost 23s. each to make, exclusive of the warehouse charges, and they were delivered to the Railways Commissioners for 17s. each. Business conducted upon those lines is not likely to be very satisfactory to the shareholders. </para>

                            <para>- No; it was alleged to be due to mismanagement. Before the present Tariff was introduced, the shareholders in that mill were assured that under the old duties it would pay its way arid return a handsome profit. There is one matter that we must not forget, namely, that while New South Wales has been a free-trade State for the past twenty-five or thirty years, Victoria has been a protectionist State during that time. Those who worshipped the fetish of high protection in Victoria predicted that this State would become the working-man&#39;s paradise and the hub of Australia. But at the time Federation was accomplished, the manufactories of New South Wales were quite as flourishing as were the hot-house creations of Victoria. </para>

But instead of the high protective policy of Victoria being responsible for an influx of population there was actually an exodus from the State - so great an exodus that the working men, the backbone of the country, were leaving it in thousands.

                            <para>- The increase of population caused by the development of the pastoral industry will necessarily be gradual, whereas the increase of population in Victoria, owing to the gold rush, &#34;was very sudden. However, this State is now losing population. New South Wales has a larger population at the present time, and Victoria will never be her equal again in that respect. I do not wish to discuss the various items of the Tariff schedule in detail, but there are one or two matters that I should like to mention. I had proposed to. deal at some length with the surprising proposal of the Government to tax works of art. Why, sir, we know it to be a fact that other nations, and particularly Italy, have passed laws absolutely prohibiting the export of works of art of a certain character, and only the other day we read that an American millionaire became very indignant because the Italian Government, becoming suspicious of his removing some art treasures, searched his yacht. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I suppose we have some artists here, and no &#34;doubt very good artists - I do not know whether there are any in the House - but the idea of taxing works of art seems to me absolutely preposterous ; we might as well tax books and other means of education. I notice that in the Tariff there are several items which have been transferred from an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty to a measurement duty - to a duty of so much per cubic foot, outside measurement. Not being very well acquainted with the way in which these articles are imported, I made it my business to find out how the proposed duties will affect some industries, and what they really represent. One item, which the women of Australia will require very shortly, is preserving jars. There are a few made in Australia, but the local supply is not equal to the demand, and, further, those that are made here are not satisfactory, because they are not absolutely air-tight. Under the old Tariff there was a duty of 20 per cent., whereas under the new Tariff the duty is is. id. per cubic foot. I have made inquiries, and I find that, whereas the old duty on a shipment which Cost &#163;14 is. id. amounted to &#163;2 14s. 8d., under the new rate of is. per. cubic foot the duty on a similar consignment is &#163;7 4s. 8d., or nearly 70 per cent, increase. That is a very big increase in the duty on articles which are&#39; so much required. Then on patent tin-top jelly jars and similar glassware, which is brought principally from America, where it is made wholesale by machinery, the old duty of 20 per cent, on a consignment which cost &#163;5 6s. 3d. was &#163;1 5s. nd., whereas under the new rate of 2s. per cubic foot the duty amounts to &#163;8, or about 1.15 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to understate rather than overstate the case. But as I am not very expert at these mental calculations, I am willing to accept the figures of the honorable member. The new duty on lamp chimneys, which are used principally by the poorer classes, is 2s. 6d. per cubic foot, and this, on a consignment valued at &#163;6 13s. 10d. amounts to j&#163;8, as contrasted with the old duty of 20 per cent., or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 6s. 7d. On stoneware, such as bread crocks, there was no duty in New South Wales before Federation, and the whole of the market was supplied by one local manufacturer. The Federal Parliament, in its wisdom, generously made that gentleman a present of a duty of 20 per cent. , and, although under free-trade he had so far succeeded as to crowd out all his competitors, he promptly raised the price. It is now proposed to increase the duty by 10 per cent., in order, I suppose, that he may add a little more to his profits. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member  seems to forget that statement is not argument, even though it comes from the Ministerial benches. I have already pointed out that the duty paid  on  these baskets&#39; is 19s. id., and that, added to the freight, makes a total impost of nearly 135 per cent. Then waste-paper baskets  per set are charged duties which equal respectively 242 per cent, and 322 per cent. There is only one other item in the Tariff to which I desire to refer, and that is the inexplicable duty of 7s, 6d. each on chairs. We know that the local manufacture  of  Vienna chairs, and of the cheaper lines of American chairs, is impossible, since we have not supplies of wood suitable for the purpose. Chairs were&#39; already protected  to  the extent  of  between 35 per cent.&#34; and 50 per cent, by the duty, freight, and charges under the old Tariff. The impost  of  7s. 6d. per chair is absolutely prohibitive. I do not like Austrian chairs, and have very few in my house, but they are largely used by the favorite friends of the Postmaster-General, the working people. As an example of the magnitude of this burden I propose to quote figures supplied to me by Messrs. W. W. Campbell and Co. Ltd.-, in reference to a certain shipment. They have now arriving 303 dozen of these chairs. When they were ordered, under the old rate of duty, the firm would have had to pay, and were prepared to pay, an impost of &#163;108, but under the new Tariff they will have to pay a duty amounting to no less than &#163;1,363. At the time of the declaration of the Tariff hundreds of cases were on the water. These will be forced into bond, and either, as in the case of a shipment of bicycles, will be reshipped to the port of origin, or, perhaps, as one firm has offered to do, will be burnt on the wharfs. This is protection run mad ; there is no other way in which to describe it. The proposal of the leader of the Labour Party, which he describes as the &#34; new protection,&#34; is, to my mind, an absolute acknowledgment that so far, at all events, as the workers are concerned, protection in itself is a failure. It fails to benefit them or to-&#34; improve their conditions. It is a matter of common history that although protection as a rule increases the wealth of the community, it puts that increased wealth into the pockets of the few. We are told that such a state of affairs is not to continue ; But the proposal to regulate prices seems to me &#163;0 be absolutely unworkable. It is by no means a new proposition. The experiment has been tried in different forms from almost the commencement of civilization. In the days of one of the Edwards - I think it was Edward I. - a. law -was passed to limit the charge for eggs to is. per dozen, and when we remember the difference between the purchasing power of money then and now, that was a fairly high rate to fix. The proposal put forward by the Labour Part}7, however, is not likely, in my opinion, to help the consumer. The honorable member for South Sydney, and the honorable member for Boothby, admitted that goods could not be followed until they reached the hands of the retailer with the object of insuring that the consumer should not be charged more than a reasonable rate for them. The honorable member for Boothby said he proposed to see that a fair charge was made for goods as they left the hands of the manufacturer. We can see at once how easy it would be to overcome such a scheme. It would be an easy matter to do what is done at the present time - to introduce a third party, or middleman, to whom  the manufacturer would sell at a reasonable price. This third party might consist of a company run by the manufacturers themselves. They might sell at a reasonable price to the middleman, and take their chief profit from his sales instead of from the sales of the factory. So far as I can see the proposal will not work. We admit that protection, if high enough, will create a certain quantity of work for a certain number of people. I suppose pine apples could be grown at the South Pole if a demand could be created for them there, and a sufficiently high duty to bring up the prices could be imposed. The point that I wish to emphasize is that under a protective policy we take much from the pockets of the multitude - from the consuming classes - for the sake of benefiting the few. In an effort to bolster up a few industries we are taxing the whole of the general community. There is another matter to which I desire to refer. So much has been said upon the subject of the Federal Capital, from which it might be inferred that the Premier of New South Wales is responsible for the present position, that I thought it might be of interest to the Committee, as well as to the public generally, to show the action of the present Government since the Bill dealing with this question was passed. I find that on the 19th October, 1905, the honorable member for Parramatta asked the Prime Minister whether he was - in a position to give the House information concerning the recent conference between the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth and the Attorney-General of New South Wales in reference to the Federal Capital site ? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows just as well as I do that neither the Government nor this. Parliament considered the question as settled. If it were, why does not the Government say straight out, &#34; We have settled the question and will not do anything further; we abide by the selection made by Parliament?&#34; But the promise made to the people of New South Wales was not fulfilled by the selection of Dalgety, which does not comply with the spirit of the compact. </para>

                            <para>- I know that Bombala was, but Dalgety was not. When the compact was entered into by which the Federal Capital was to be in New- South Wales, not less than 100 miles from Sydney, it was recognised as a compromise between the requirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner that the Capital should be at least 200 miles from Sydney, and that of the right honorable member for East Sydney that it should not be less than 75 miles from Sydney. In order that we may keep faith with New South Wales, the selected site should be somewhere near to the 100-mile limit. I know a score of men who, when Federation was under discussion, did not think that the Capital question mattered a button; but they now feel irritated owing to the fact that New South Wales has been &#34; had &#34; in the matter. They remind me of a. man who goes into a shop to make a purchase. He does not care about a matter of Jd. in his change, and under ordinary circumstances would go away without it. </para>

                            <para>- Personally, I prefer the Seat of Government Bill. I would rather have that question settled, because I believe that it would do much to allay the irritation which is felt in New South Wales against this Government. The honorable member for Cook wanted to know my views upon the question of protecting the iron industry. I regard the iron industry from a stand-point quite other than that of a mere Tariff issue. The money we expend in establishing it will be spent, not for the advantage of any one individual, but as an insurance from a defence stand-point, in order that we may have in the time of need those thing&#39;s which are absolutely essential for our defence. </para>

                            <para>- I believe I should. One is ready to admit a certain amount of unconscious bias, but I have looked at the matter fairly and squarely,- and the reasons I have given are those which have actuated me, and would still have actuated &#34;me if Lithgow had not been in the Nepean electorate. On the question of defence we are simply drifting we know not where. We are living over what may be described as a live volcano. After the expiration of seven years, when the Anglo-Japanese &#39;Treaty will have expired, we do not know at what moment we may be called upon to fight for our national existence. That is the aspect from which I view this industry. It is  absolutely essential that we should have somewhere in Australia a means of turning our native ores into iron in order that we may have the necessary means of defence. I do not understand the attitude of the Government. They have proposed a duty for every other industry. But in this case they defer the duty pending the payment of a bounty. The only reason they could give for that attitude would be that they want to see the industry established first, but it has been already established, so much so that it is able, if it gets the orders, to turn out enough pig-iron to supply the whole of the Commonwealth. There is no question as to the quality of the iron, which is admitted to. be equal, if not superior, to the best that we can import. I noticed in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of yesterday an account of an interview with Messrs. Dallimore Brothers, ironfounders, of South Melbourne, who were asked to express their opinion about the Australian iron that they are now using. They had nothing but praise for it. They said-   &#34; It is of first-class quality ; better than the </para>

                            <para>- I am telling honorable members my. reason for supporting this particular proposal. We know that the Sydney market quite lately was flooded by a shipment of Bengal iron. I wish to point out, in connexion with this matter, that the successful tenderers for the South Australian iron were a firm who have to do largely with shipping and importing, and who, during a certain season of the year, are able to import pig iron as stiffening and ballast at a very low freight indeed. I am told, though I have not been able absolutely to verify the statement, that there is a clause in the agreement to the effect that if this Parliament imposes the  12&#189;  per cent, duty that is proposed in the Tariff, the South Australian Government, and not the importer, will bear the expense of the duty. It works out in this way  that  if the  12&#189;  per cent, duty is added to the price quoted by the successful tenderer for this iron, the Lithgow tender would be about  5s.  per ton less than the tender of the other people. </para>

                            <para>- That is what I say. The Government acknowledge that the duty will have to follow the bounty. But, since we have established the industry, and are within&#163;100,000 of the limit of our&#39;expenditure, it seems to me that, in the circumstances, it might, perhaps, be better to impose the  12&#189;  per cent, duty asked for in the first instance. In considering this matter, we must remember that, although in England a considerable number of women are employed at the lighter labour in iron work&#39;s, in Australia we have not, and I hope never will have, any female labour employed in the industry. It is true that we employ a few youths at work of a very simple and light character, but the number is but a fraction of the  700  or  800  men employed in the industry. These are the principal things I wished to ask the Committee to remember in dealing with the iron duty. I repeat that it is the immediate and pressing nature of the question of defence which has forced the consideration of this question upon me, and which compels me to support a proposal which the Prime Minister himself described as worth a considerable national sacrifice. </para>

                            <para>- I was going to recall the self-denial of the honorable member for Parramatta, who represented the Lithgow district when this House dealt with the iron industry. That honorable member was prepared to sacrifice his constituents, and did forego their advantage on the altar of the general welfare.&#39; That was the position taken up by the honorable member for Parramatta, and I am pleased to be able to compliment him upon it. We can all remember that when the old Tariff was being framed, staunch free-traders voted for salt and other duties, while gentlemen having manufacturing ironworks in their electorates supported high duties on machinery. In this t connexion, I must pay a tribute to the honorable member for Dalley, who, at that time, was a consistent free-trader, and refused to vote even for duties by which his constituents would have largely benefited </para>

                            <para>- I shall proceed to do justice all round. Whoever is to blame for the delay in fixing the site of the Capital it is not this Parliament. In that regard the Premier of New South Wales has acted the part of a violent incendiary, who would put . a torch to the edifice of the Commonwealth in order to gratify his own political ambition. He has reached out after notoriety and brought home nothing but the contempt and execration of the whole of Australia. It is quite true, as the honorable member for Laanecoorie has said, that if the representatives of New South Wales in this House had made up their minds about a site for the Capital it would have been fixed long ago. Now, in all the divisions that have taken place on this question not once have <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> voted for Dalgety. I do not believe that it is a suitable site. I think that New South Wales ought not to hesitate about giving  the Commonwealth the area for which it has asked, and also an independent outlet, either to the ocean or to another State. </para>

                            <para>- I have nothing to say against Jervis Bay. It is unnecessary to dwell on the hair-splitting of the lawyers in New South Wales over that vexed provision in the Constitution which is supposed to confine our choice to some territory&#39; which shall have been set apart by its Government.  Practically, Dalgety was set apart. We have heard the honorable member for Nepean &#39;&#171; legal quibble that only Bombala was set apart. He knows quite well that the district set apart for the consideration of this Parliament was the Monaro district, which contains both Bombala and Dalgety, and in which all Crown lands were temporarily reserved. I desire, in passing, to say that, although&#39; I have so far voted against Dalgety, unless I can see - a more suitable site in the future I shall vote for Dalgety in the next division which is taken. No one with any regard for the future of his country can allow any provincial politician to dictate to the Parliament of Australia where its Capital is to be. </para>

                            <para>- No; I would vote for a better site if I saw one, but I have not yet seen one. Dalgety was not my original choice, but I would sooner vote for that site than one which had nothing better to recommend it than proximity to Sydney. I would, of course, defer to the judgment of men who are better qualified to speak as to water conservation and the other requisites for a great city in the interior. Passing from that matter, I am glad to acknowledge the suggestion of the honorable member for Capricornia as one of the few valuable ideas which have been revealed during this debate. He has noticed, as I think every one who represents remote portions of the Commonwealth has noticed, the small interest which the people of those parts take in Federal affairs.  His  discovery is not by any means original, nor is his suggested remedy new. I may remind him and others who may not be aware of the fact that this Parliament has gone a long way to cheapen telegraphic information to the Inter-State press. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but we are dealing now with press information only. Very early in its history, on my motion, the House decided that the Victorian inland rate for press messages should prevail throughout Australia; but the use which was made of the privilege by the newspapers did not come up to the expectations of those who supported the motion. There is a germ of usefulness in this suggestion for a summarized official report. I think that the Government might well consider the question of issuing - not in substitution of, but as supplementary to, <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> - at the end of or during each sitting, a summary of the debates and proceedings in both Houses, and offering it to the press correspondents to be despatched to the daily newspapers. I believe that a great many daily newspapers would be prepared to . take this summary of the proceedings in this Parliament if it were offered in that way. Then for the weekly newspapers, a different arrangement could be made. </para>

                            <para>- I think that if an officer of the House were intrusted with the work he would perform it impartially. However, the matter need not be discussed at any length now. I have referred to it only incidentally. Amongst the. items in the Budget that ought to excite attention is the enormous expenditure which the Commonwealth is called upon to pay to keep alive the sugar industry in Queensland and New South Wales. The manner in which this expenditure is increasing ought to (rive us pause. Despite all the juggling in connexion with import duty, Excise duty, and bounty, the fact is clear that nearly &#163;6 is&#39; paid by. the public on every ton of sugar consumed, the output of the two States being about 200,000 tons per  annum </para>

                            <para>- Yes. That is what the present system is costing Australia. There is an import duty of &#163;6 a&#34; ton, and the price of Australian sugar is increased by nearly the amount of that duty. Production has already practically overtaken demand here, and the -honorable member for Angas the other  day  informed us that he had in his possession an invoice showing that Australian&#39; sugar was exported to South Africa, and sold there for &#163;3 18s. a ton less than similar sugar was bringing in the Australian market. Are we to continue taxing our people to enable South Africans and foreigners to buy our  sugar more cheaply than Australians can buy it? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Angas did not state the Quantity sold, but no doubt lie would be willing to show the invoice to any one interested in &#39;the subject. The bounty which it is estimated will be paid this year to Queensland is &#163;500,000, and to New South  Wales,  &#163;73,000, while the expenses of administration will come to &#163;7,323; a total expenditure of &#163;580,323. Since this system was adopted bounties have cost the Commonwealth &#163;1,371,513. The people of Australia would not have so much to complain of if the object for which the bounty is given had been attained. The present policy was instituted under the influence of public sentiment in favour of a white Australia, though, as every one knows, the kanakas engaged in sugar growing are the least objectionable of our coloured population. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not follow the honorable member into the by-path toward which he is wandering. Our policy, although so expensive, has not been successful in bringing about the production of sugar wholly by white labour. In 1902, in Queensland, 60.9 farmers employed white labour, and 39.1 black labour; while in 1907 89.1 employed white labour, and 10.9 black labour. In New South Wales in 1902 89.7 farmers employed white labour, and 10.3 black labour; and in 1907 88.2 employed white labour, and 11.8 black labour, showing an increase in the employers of black labour in five years. Although there is an impression that the bounty, which has increased by nearly &#163;300,000 in one year, is bringing about the employment of white labour only, on the 31st December, 1905, there were employed in the sugar industry in Queensland 7,970 coloured persons, and in New South Wales 483, a total of 8,452 ; while on the 31st December, 1906, there were employed in Queensland 6,323 coloured persons, and in New South Wales 468, a total of 6,791. In addition 785 coloured persons were employed in the factories of Queensland, and 500 in the factories of New South Wales. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not think that that is a satisfactory state of affairs, in view of the enormous sacrifice which the people of Australia are making to hand the industry over to white men. During the last Parliament I did think that the time had arrived when we ought to reconsider attempts to bolster up the Queensland sugar industry. I would also point out that the white workers in that industry experience the very greatest difficulty in exacting ah adequate wage from the planters. As the honorable member for Herbert showed the latter even sent their emissaries to the old world to engage Italian and other cheap European labour, notwithstanding that an abundance of labour was available in the southern States of the Commonwealth. Allied to the question of the sugar bounty is that of the cost incurred in repatriating the kanakas. As everybody is aware, about 7,000 or 8,000 kanakas have been returned to their islands. Originally they were brought from their homes by the Government of Queensland for the purpose of assisting the development of the sugar industry in that State. Under the system which then obtained, the planters were compelled to lodge with the Government a deposit of &#163;5 per head in order to defray the expense of deporting the kanakas to the Pacific Islands upon the expiration of their agreements. But what did we find? That this fund had actually been absorbed in the Queensland revenue and expended for other purposes. Now, the Government of Queensland ask this Parliament, and the people of the southern States - who are not interested in sugar except to the extent that they have to pay a high price for it - to subscribe the necessary funds for the deportation of these kanakas. To my astonishment a sum of money for the purpose was placed upon the Estimates, a considerable portion of which has been expended. That this expenditure evoked protest from only a small section of the House is certainly surprising. I think that the Queensland Government should be required to pay the cost of deporting their own kanakas instead of asking the people of Australia - who are already paying over &#163;1,000,000 a year to keep the industry going - for further contributions. Then there is another remarkable item of which this Committee ought to take notice. Whilst Parliament was in recess, the Government actually pledged the people of Australia to an expenditure of &#163;10,000 for the purpose of repatriating a number of persons in South Africa. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that persons who leave Australia when she is suffering from some temporary misfortune constitute a class whom we ought to go out of our way to help. We must recollect that the individuals who have been repatriated went to South Africa hoping to better themselves. They did not do so. They discovered that they were worse off there than they were here. Whilst I do not altogether favour the idea of denying them assistance, I question whether the Government should have anticipated the opinion of Parliament by expending &#163;9,852 to bring these people back here. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. A number of the most objectionable characters - who had never been in Australia before - were introduced. The arrival of these persons was coincident with a very remarkable outbreak of crime in this city. In open daylight a diamond merchant was murdered in an office in Collins-street, and a short time previous to that a most mysterious robbery was perpetrated at the Melbourne Mint, not to mention other crimes of minor importance. I do not say that these crimes were committed by persons who had been repatriated, or by any new arrival from South Africa, but it is significant that they were contemporaneous. I notice upon the Estimates an item of &#163;20,000 for advertising Australia. I desire to know whether this money is to be expended in attracting people to our shores by false representations in the way. that has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur?</inline> We are all familiar with the letter that he forwarded to his agent in Melbourne - a letter in which he stated that the conditions of Australian land tenure were to be &#34; kept dark &#34; from intending immigrants. I know, too, that miners are being attracted to the Commonwealth by false representations. I am satisfied that this Parliament does not intend to vote &#163;20,000 to lure people to Australia by any such means. Before the item is agreed to, I hope we shall have a specific undertaking from the Government that the money will be expended in advertising our resources amongst the people of the United King dom, and not in an endeavour to attract workmen to compete in city trades. </para>

                            <para>- It is most extraordinary that immigrants do not stay in Canada when they reach that country. They cross over into the United States. It is only because of our distance from the old world that we are at a disadvantage in the matter of securing desirable immigrants. If we were as near to Great Britain as is Canada, we should possess a much larger population than does that country. </para>

                            <para>- I do not mind holding out the attractions of Australia to legitimate settlers who are prepared to go on the land, or engage in the primary industries. The honorable member will agree with me that it is not right to bring to Australia working men, such as miners, or others to compete in city trades and other occupations which are not too attractive at the present time to our own people. The honorable member for Fawkner was good enough to tell us that kerosene and tea ought to be taxed in order to pay old-age pensions, contending that in order to avoid the suspicion of pauperism the necessary funds should be raised by taxation paid by all. I say, in reply, that if there are not to be old-age pensions until the money is derived from taxes on the necessaries of life, I hope they will be postponed for some time. As I pointed out when the honorable member was speaking, there is very little kerosene used in Toorak ; and, in my opinion, any taxation necessary in order to pay old-age pensions ought to be taxation on land and wealth. A man who. has qualified for an old-age pension by long residence in the country, must have done much to advance the interests and welfare of the community. And who gets the benefit of the work of such men? No one, in the long run, but the landowner. What is the effect of accretions of population here ? Is it not to increase the value of the lands? Who has increased the value of the land in Melbourne and the other cities of Australia? Who made land in Collins-street worth from &#163;300 to &#163;500 a foot? It was not the owners - not the fortunate individuals who came here in the early days and happened  to obtain possession of blocks for a mere song - but it was the accumulation of people who found the city convenient for business and required the land. Therefore, I say that the owners of those lands, and other wealthy people, ought to be taxed in order to pay old-age pensions&#39;. The honorable member also referred - and I thought his reference most unhappy - to the epoch of 1893, which he said marked the first appearance of the Labour Party in Parliament, and the beginning of the growth of class strife and other evils which he contended had followed the advent of that party. The honorable member could not have been more unfortunate in his selection of the date, because it was in 1893 that for the first time in Australia an Australian Parliament said to the banks, &#34; You need not pay your debts.&#34; This was done by the Victorian Parliament, in this very Chamber ; and payment was suspended by the banks for a whole week. This I can regard as no other .than legalized robbery of the depositors - among whom were many widows and children. The year 1893 has been burned into the minds of the thrifty people of Australia, who were forced by law to leave their money with the banks for periods ranging from three to ten years. The public at that time were robbed by the class which the honorable member for Fawkner represents - bank directors and others. </para>

                            <para>- I can quite believe the statement. Of course, the honorable member for Fawkner himself is a generous and kind-hearted man; he and others in the Opposition corner possibly have very kindly sentiments towards the working people of the country. I can quite believe that if the French aristocracy had shown, a similar willingness to recognise the rights of the masses when Tom Paine wrote <inline font-style="italic">The Age of Reason,</inline> the French Revolution, with all its horrors, might not have occurred. But&#39;, as everybody knows, the aristocracy disregarded the advice of Paine. They read the first edition of his work and threw it aside with the utmost contempt; but it is said that their skins went to bind the third edition. Nothing of that sort, I hope, will occur in Australia. I wish to say to honorable members in the Opposition corner that, while I have every respect for them personally, I shall view with some suspicion proposals emanating from them, especially in reference to the Tariff. I think it was Daniel O&#39;Connell who, on one occasion in the House of Commons, when asked what course he proposed to take in regard to a certain proposal, replied, &#34; I shall wait until I see what the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> urges, and if I do the opposite I know I shall be right.&#34; The honorable member for Fawkner said that 93 per cent, of the lands of Australia were still unalienated, leaving it to be inferred that there is ample room and scope for all who choose to come to the country. Anybody who has been in the interior of Australia, and &#39;knows that over vast areas the rainfall is only 5 or 6 inches per annum, will readily understand the absurdity  of the honorable member&#39;s suggestion. The . real trouble is that the most fertile and the richest portions of Australia are already alienated and in the hands of a few ; and what is required to promote settlement and increase the population is a stiff land tax that will render it unprofitable for the present holders to continue their policy of keeping the lands locked up. It is expected, I presume, of every honorable member that he should at this stage make some declaration in regard to the Tariff. I recognise that, for good or ill, the people of Australia have declared for protection. So far as I am personally concerned, while I do not believe in overloading the primary industries from which Australia derives the bulk of its wealth, I intend to recognise the will of the people. Where it is possible I shall give my vote for duties, provided the interests of the workers are conserved, and that some scheme is devised for the protection of the consumers. The objectionable features of protection will be largely removed if we are able to provide, on the one hand, that the workers shall receive fair wages under good conditions, and that the consumers shall not be swindled. Subject to these reservations, I intend to consider every duty on its merits, and to vote in the direction which I think the people of Australia desire. I am sorry that the honorable member for Fremantle is not present, because I intended to indorse the remarks made by him as to the vast undeveloped wealth of the north-west portion of Western Australia.  His  speech was, on the whole, an excellent effort, though some of his arguments were scarcely consistent with his fiscal professions. Like that delivered by the honorable member for Nepean, it was the utterance of a freetrader rather than of a protectionist, in which guise the honorable member for Fremantle was returned. I failed to recognise orthodox protectionist principles in his contentions. He seems to think that the primary industries only require that their machinery and appliances shall be unburdened by Tariff taxation. If he has studied the question he ought to know that machinery is but one factor of an industry. If taxes be levied on the cost-of living and other factors of an industry, then that industry, from the honorable member&#39;s point of view, is not receiving fair play. I do not wish to make any further reference to the honorable member&#39;s speech, but I trust that the Committee will give some attention to the complaints coming from Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Western Australia occupies a unique position. The honorable member for Parramatta knows full well that no other State in the Union has derived less than she has from Federation. She depends mainly on four industries - mining, agricultural, pastoral, and timber getting - and not one of them, so far as I can see, is likely to be benefited by the Tariff. The position of the other States is altogether different. New South Wales has vast deposits of coal and iron, as well as an abundance of cheap labour, and she must be the seat of many flourishing industries. Wages prevailing in Western Australia, on the other hand, are higher than those paid in any other part of the Union, and the industries of that State must necessarily come down before the competition of the longer established manufactures of the eastern States. Without expressing any sympathy with what is, after all, a foolish agitation for secession, I think this House might give attention to the special needs and requirements of Western Australia. I would remind honorable members that we shall have an opportunity, when the Navigation Bill is before us, to show some consideration for its well-being. It ought not to be forgotten that Western Australia is absolutely confined to sea communication with the east. Unlike the other States, she has no land communication with the rest of the Commonwealth. I hope, therefore, that we shall impose as few restrictions as possible on coastal vessels trading between the west and the east. I thought of referring to a number of special advantages which the other States have received from the Union as contra-distinguished from Western Australia, but since I desire to assist in bringing to a speedy termination what, after all, must have proved to the public a wearisome debate, I shall refrain from doing so. The Federal Government, to my mind, is not preserving its self-respect to a sufficient extent in its dealings with the States Premiers. Every year a Conference of the States Premiers meets in some Australian capital to discuss questions of Federal importance which this Parliament was created by the people to deal with. I am not singling out any one party for special censure. The present Prime Minister is as much to blame as is the leader of the Opposition. All have bent the knee to the States Premiers, with a view, apparently, of cultivating their good-will. I do not know why they should have done so. </para>

                            <para>- If we attempted to interfere with the functions of the States, the Premiers would promptly resent our action. I propose to put before the Committee some figures which the Treasury officials have specially prepared for me as bearing on the question of States expenditure. I wish honorable members to understand that the States Governments, which are constantly girding at Federation, have enormously increased their expenditure, despite the fact that the Commonwealth has relieved them of the cost of defence, and of the Post and Telegraph Department, the Customs Department, and other services which I shall enumerate later on. </para>

                            <para>- I shall, later on, read the actual figures. Before doing so, I wish to explain that during the six years 1899-1900 to 1905-6 the expenditure of the States, after deducting the cost of defence and all other Federal Departments, has increased by &#163;4,242,435. Some people may say that this increase is due to an enormous increase in population. I would point out, however, that the population on the 31st March, 1900, was 3,775,355as against 4,119,480 on 31st December, 1906, so that for the six years there was an increase of only 344,125. The additional expenditure of the States in respect of the same period was equal to &#163;12 3s. 7d. per head of the  increased population. I shall now put before the Committee the detailed figures, in order to show in what Departments these increases have occurred - </para>

I am glad to notice, however, that the States have increased their sinking funds, to provide for the redemption of the public, debt from &#163;&#34;595,016 to &#163;947;75I- The only State which has not added anything to its sinking fund is Queensland, though some of the other States have made very small contributions. Tasmania has added only ,&#163;29,000 to its sinking fund, and </para>
                    <para>South  Australia only &#163;&#34;181,000. The railway expenditure has increased from &#163;6,600,000 to &#163;8,000,000 odd. The expenditure on public works and buildings shows a decrease from &#163;&#34;1,751,848 to &#163;1,672,036 - a decrease of over ,&#163;100,000. The expenditure on lands and survey has increased from &#163;649,000 to &#163;747,000; on mines  from  &#163;&#34;278,000 to ,&#163;419,000 ; on police from &#163;&#34;1,058,823 to &#163;&#34;1,167,422 ; on education from &#163;2,044,000 to &#163;2,409,000; on &#39;medical services, lunacy, and public health from &#163;&#34;490,000 to &#163;&#34;593,000. I am &#39; not complaining of the increase on account of the  last  item, nor of that on account of education. Omitting Customs, Defence, and Post Office expenditure, we come to the expenditure upon the States Governors. In 1900 the various States spent upon their Governors ,&#163;37,000. To-day, despite the additional paraphernalia connected with the Governor-General, the States are spending &#163;&#39;28,735. A small reduction is shown on that account; but honorable members will remember that one of the attractions of Federation for the public was the prospect of an enormous saving in the expenditure on the States Governments and the States Parliaments. Will it be believed, however, that the States have only slightly reduced their annual outlay on their Parliaments? In 1900 the cost, of them was &#163;255,000 ; last year they cost &#163;224,000. </para>

                            <para>- I have just received a telegram from an important centre in Western .Australia, informing me that a public meeting has passed a resolution demanding the abolition of States Parliaments. On their Agents-General the States in 1900 spent &#163;25,958. Last year they spent &#163;25,668. It was understood that the Agents-General would no longer be required as soon as the Commonwealth had an officer in London. The Commonwealth now has an officer in London, but the States have retained their Agents General, offices, and staffs. I see that quite recently the salary of the Victorian Agent-General was increased by a large amount. Evidently there is no intention to effect any real economy in that direction. I should have men,tioned,  in connexion with this return, that the Treasury officials inform me that they had the greatest difficulty in getting the information that it contains. There is a line at the bottom of it which shows the difficulty experienced. As soon as it was ascertained -for what purpose the information was intended, obstacles were placed in the way of the Treasury officials obtaining it. Surely it is a most extraordinary thing, that the Federal Government, which returns to the States more than three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled, does not receive proper courtesy when it applies for information about the expenditure of the States. Regarding the final item, which is put under the heading of &#34;all other expenditure,-&#39; in 1900 it amounted to &#163;&#34;4,438.625, and in 1906 to &#163;&#34;4,879,637. Probably a good many items in connexion with the States Parliaments and the Governors are concealed under this heading where is shown an increased expenditure of over ,&#163;400,000 during the six years of Federation. I wish to summarize the result of this table for the benefit of honorable members. It should be remembered that it takes into account the fact that the cost of Customs and Excise, post and telegraphs, and defence - the defence of Australia costing nearly &#163;1,000,000 per annum - has been deducted from the totals. When the expenditure on account of Customs and Excise, post and telegraphs and defence for 1899-1900 is deducted, there remains this fact - that the expenditure of the six States in 1900 was only &#163;25,469,084, whilst to-day, with only about 300,000 people more to govern, it is ,&#163;29,754,199, or an increase of &#163;4,285,115 in six years. </para>

                            <para>- I wish honorable members to understand that the figures which I have given do not represent the whole of the increased expenditure during the six. years. I find a note to the effect that the figures do not include such expenditure as repairs, maintenance of buildings, and so on. Of course, in Western Australia there has been a large expenditure on water supply and similar works. But the point which I wish to emphasize is that the increase in population during the period mentioned was only 344,000, and that the increased expenditure amounts to &#163;12 3s. 7d. per head of that increase. At any rate these figures constitute a sufficient indictment for the States Premiers to answer, without their interfering in the purely Federal functions which this Parliament was created to look after. I am sorry that the right honorable member for Swan is not present, because I intended to refer in detail to the attitude of the right honorable member. My criticism is not intended to be unduly censorious, the right honorable gentleman possessing many qualities which extort our admiration; but even the most perfect character can receive a little benefit from an occasional chastening. The right honorable member has been very explicit and decisive in his condemnation of the Tariff submitted by the present Government.  His  remarks invite, if they do not compel, one to compare his professions of to-day with his performances a few years ago. When the Kingston Tariff was introduced in 1901-2 there was a great outcry against it in Western Australia, although somewhat less intense than the present protest. To silence dissatisfaction at that time, the right honorable member for Swan assured the people of Western Australia that the Kingston Tariff would take from that State only &#163;708,000, or 28s. per head per annum less than the people had hitherto paid. The result of the Tariff completely falsified the right honorable member&#39;s prediction and promise. In 1899, the year before Federation, the Western Australian Customs and Excise Tariff produced &#163;833,000, or &#163;4 17s. 5d. per head of the population. The result of the first year of the Kingston Tariff in Western Australia, despite the large reductions that were made by Parliament, reached &#163;1,335,000 amounting to &#163;6 17s.1d. per head, or just under &#163;2 per head in excess of the Customs taxation imposed by the State of Western Australia in 1899.In the following year, the Kingston Tariff produced &#163;1,396,000 in Western Australia, but as the population had meanwhile increased, the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> tax fell to &#163;6 9s. 9d. The Tariff introduced by the Acting Prime Minister, which the right honorable member for Swan regards as very oppressive, is estimated to produce annually in Western Australia &#163;1,009,000, or only &#163;3 15s. 7d. per head of the population. In other words, the new Tariff will be far less burdensome to Western Australia than was the Kingston Tariff, of which the right honorable member for Swan was an enthusiastic supporter. It will collect less from Western Australia by over &#163;300,000 per annum, and will extract from the people &#163;3 2s. per head less. The right honorable member may say that these figures do not represent the real taxation of the people under the Tariff. In fact, he has practically said so. He says that the people of Western Australia are now purchasing goods from the eastern States, and paying more than they would pay if the goods were obtained from abroad, and that the increase is going into the pockets of the merchants in those States instead of into the Treasury. I believe that to be a fact to some extent. If it were not so, why are the people of Western Australia holding monster meetings to express their sense of this peril to their interests, and why should the Parliament of the State almost unanimously pass a remonstrance against the new duties? The fact is that the right honorable member has floundered continuously in his calculations about the effect of Federation on Western Australia. As far back as 1899, he was a member of a Select Committee of both Houses of the local Parliament, which sat to consider the probable financial results if. Western Australia joined the Union. He then adopted the report of the State Actuary, whose figures, as I shall show, proved ludicrously wide of the mark. I refer to these calculations mainly because the same officer is now furnishing the State Government with statistics exaggerating the effect of the new Tariff. In July,  1899, the Western Australian Actuary submitted a report in which he offered, on the basis of a stationary population, a forecast of &#34; the results of Federation on the finances of Western Australia, as they affect the Colonial Treasurer.&#34; He estimated the total Customs and Excise  revenue  of the Commonwealth at &#163;7,181,000 of which Western Australia was to contribute &#163;630,000. In the first year of the uniform duties, he expected Western Australia to gain &#163;9,500, but in subsequent years he gives the losses to the local Treasury as follows: - second year, &#163;150,800; third year, &#163;196,450 ; fourth year, &#163;242,050; fifth year, &#163;287,650; sixth and succeeding year&#39;s,&#163;333,250. This gentleman, who is now putting exaggerated statements before the people of Western Australia, and rousing their animosity against the Federation, was astray with regard to the Commonwealth revenue by no less than &#163;1,500,000. To show the magnitude of his error respecting the losses to the State Treasury, I cannot do better than set out the exact amount paid over by the Commonwealth to the Western Australian State Treasurer year by . year. He estimated the total revenue from Western Australia at &#163;630,000, whereas the actual sums remitted to Perth were as follow :  - first year, &#163;1,221,948; second year, &#163;1,256,923; third year, &#163;1,064,035; fourth year, &#163;1,031,223; fifth year, &#163;871,960- </para>

                            <para>- It was due to the disappearance of the sliding scale of duties. In the sixth year, when the sliding scale finally disappeared, the amount was &#163;774,719. To put the matter in another form, this statistician calculated that the Western Australian Treasury in six years of a uniform Tariff would lose &#163;1,200,000, whereas it has gained in that period something like &#163;2,440,000. This is the official on whose calculations the public in . the West are now building, and who is responsible for breeding a good deal of disaffection in Western Australia. This is the unreliable guide whom the right honorable member for Swan followed before Federation. If he found it necessary some years ago to reassure Western Australia about the Kingston Tariff, a similar message is doubly necessary now in view of the effusions of this imaginative statistician. The right honor able member mentioned that of the four great industries of Western Australia the pastoral and agricultural industries did not need protection, but he left it to be inferred that the interests of the other two principal occupations of the people - mining and timber-getting - could be served by the Tariff. I should like him to explain how protection can benefit the mining industry, for even here no protectionist has yet contended that you can add a shilling to the world value of an ounce of gold or silver by means of Customs duties. However, it is a gain to find the right honorable member admitting that certain industries do not need protection, and, therefore, are not advantaged by it. The other representatives of Western Australia would have welcomed such a declaration in 1901 and 1902, but it was not forthcoming. We received no help at all from the honorable member when, in those days, we fought against the hampering shackles that were being placed on the great primary industries of our State. But he now complains, as a Western Australian member, that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission has overshot the mark, and recommended excessive duties. He cites, as articles within that category, mining machinery, barbed wire, apparel and attire, piece goods, and galvanized iron, plain and corrugated. Will it be believed that the duties of which the right honorable gentleman now complains as excessive are in the main identical with those proposed in the Kingston Tariff, as originally brought down, and for which the right honorable member was himself responsible. Here is a short list in proof of my statement. On mining machinery the original Kingston Tariff provided for a duty of 25 per cent. ; the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission is a duty of 25 per cent, on the same item. I wish the Committee to bear in mind that the right honorable member for Swan, as one of the members of the Government that brought down the Kingston Tariff, was responsible for the duties it proposed: The duty on barbed wire under the Kingston Tariff was 20 per cent., and the recommendation of the Tariff Commission is also 20 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- It is to be regretted that the right honorable gentleman is not here. Certainly, I should much prefer to make these statements to his face. On piece goods the Kingston Tariff proposed a duty of 20 per cent., and the Tariff Commission propose a similar duty. On galvanized iron the Kingston Tariff proposed a duty of 15s. per ton, whilst the Tariff Commission propose a duty of 10 per cent. On corrugated and galvanized iron the Kingston Tariff proposed a duty of 30s. per ton, and the Tariff Commission propose a duty of 15 per cent. I am not aware of anything that has recently transpired which would make a 25 per cent, duty more burdensome now than it would have been in 1902, when the right honorable gentleman advocated such a duty. When he voted for that high rate of duty on mining machinery, the right honorable gentleman knew, quite as well as he knows now, the benefit which the primary industries derive from a free and open market in which to purchase their appliances. As a matter of fact, the right honorable gentleman&#39;s Government in Western Australia for years admitted such machinery at the nominal rate of 5 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> Yet we find him, a few years later, through some occult influence that has not been explained, throwing to the winds all consideration for the industry which has lifted Western Australia into world-wide prominence and affluence. The other representatives of that State found him ranged against them in every crucial division, and if, ultimately, a less onerous toll was levied upon the primary industries, the relief came not from the right honorable member for Swan. As I have said, I would much prefer that the right honorable gentleman were present to hear these observations, but, in view of his new-born zeal for the primary industries, I propose to show the Committee how he treated the primary industries in 1902, when, as a member of the Government, he might have exercised considerable influence and power in determining the duties to be submitted to Parliament. On the 16th January, 1902, an amendment was moved that engines, boilers, and pumps, which bore a duty of 25 per cent., should be admitted free. The right honorable member paired against that. Another attempt was made to reduce the duty to 10 per cent., and he paired against that proposal also, as well as against a third proposal to reduce the duty to 15 per cent., which was lost by 25 votes to 23. He opposed amendments moved to reduce the duty on pumps from 25 to 15 per cent., and that on machines and machinery n.e.i. from 25 to 15 per cent. A reduction was moved on the duty of 25 per cent, on screws, and was carried by 23 to 19, but the right honorable member for Swan paired against it. An amendment to reduce the duty on axles from 25 to 10 per cent, was lost by two votes, and the right honorable member&#39;s vote was counted with the majority. It was proposed to reduce the duty on springs from 25 to 10 per cent., and the right honorable member paired against the amendment. On the 29th January of the same year a motion was moved to exempt all mining machinery, and was lost with the assistance of the right honorable member for Swan. Another motion to exempt diamond drills was lost by twenty-two to nineteen; and the right honorable member for Swan was opposed to any reduction. It will be seen that the articles to which I have referred are used extensively in the mining industry. The right honorable member has always pretended to be a friend of. the agriculturist, and yet when on the 30th June, 1902, the present Attorney-General carried an amendment for the abolition of the duty on threshing machines by twenty-eight votes to twenty-two, the right honorable member for Swan voted with the minority. Again, on manufactures of metals, n.e.i., an attempt was made to reduce the duty from 25 to 15 per cent., and the right honorable member voted against that. In order that I may not delay the Committee, I shall just read other items connected with the primary industries of Australia on which the right honorable member for Swan, as a member of the Government of the day, voted for the retention of the highest duty. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; he has gone to a more congenial quarter of the House. It would appear that the honorable member for Fremantle has prevailed against a law of physics, and that in his case the smaller atom has attracted the bulkier one. On the 9th April, 1902, an attempt was made to reduce the duty on mining machinery to 15 per cent., and the right honorable member for Swan voted against that. He also voted against a reduction on plain iron from 15s. per ton, and against an amendment to reduce the duty on corrugated iron from 30s. to 10s. per ton. On the 18th April, 1902, an attempt was made to free engine packing, and he voted against the proposal. Again, an attempt was made to free for mining purposes Oregon timber, which is absolutely necessary for the protection of the lives of workmen in some Australian mines, and the motion was lost by twenty-six votes to twenty-three, the honorable member for Swan voting with the majority.  I  desire now to show how he has assisted the agricultural industry. On the11th December, 1 90 1, a proposal was made to reduce the duty on agricultural machinery from 15 to 10 per cent., and he voted against that. An attempt was made to reduce the duty on horse-shoe nails from 7s. to 4s. per cwt., and he voted against that too. As regards the duty on nails, n.e.i., he voted to maintain the higher duty. He voted against the abolition of the duty on mill-boards and plough shares. He voted to retain the higher duty on axle grease and solidified oils. He voted to maintain the higher impost on asphalt tiles and roofing tiles. He thought so much of the interest of the farmer that he voted to maintain the duty on bags and sacks at 15 per cent. instead of reducing it to 10 per cent. He was so solicitous for agriculture that he refused to assist to secure the exemption of saddle trees from duty. He opposed the exemption of chilled cast shares. He voted for the higher duty on salt. He tried to maintain the duty on candles at 1&#189;d. per lb. ; he voted against two attempts to reduce that duty. He assisted to maintain the duty on mangles and washing machines at 20 per cent. Then, in regard to the pastoral industry, he assisted to maintain the higher duty on carbide of calcium which, in remote portions of Australia, is used by many squatters to manufacture a sort of gas. Then, as regards disinfectants, which are very much required and almost necessary to health in the remoter municipalities of Australia, he voted to maintain a duty of 15 per cent. He voted to maintain the duty of 2d. per lb. on laundry blue, an article of general consumption. He voted for the higher duty on cocoa, chocolate, and condensed milk. He was aware that at that time &#163;100,000 worth of condensed milk was being imported annually to Western Australia from Europe. It was the only  description  of milk which was then available to a large population in the interior. A proposal was made by me to reduce the duty on condensed milk from1&#189;d.  to ¾d. per lb. The honorable member voted against that proposal, and immediately afterwards, when I moved to reduce the duty to1d. per lb., and the question was put without any discussion, he left the Chamber and did not vote. The second division was taken immediately after the first. He voted against me on the higher duty, but, knowing the weakness of the case, he would not assist the Government to resist the lowering of the duty to1d. On piece goods, on which he now complains the duty is too high, he voted to maintain an impost of 20 per cent. He voted to maintain the duty on apparel at 25 per cent., on dungarees and  denims at7&#189; per cent.;  on matches at is. per gross, and on bananas at is. per cental. That is a little list which I have pleasure in presenting to the right honorable gentleman. &#34;&#39; There are one or two other matters which I had intended to refer to. The other day the honorable gentleman said that he would be ashamed, to have his name associated with such a preferential trade proposal as the Government have submitted in the Tariff. But what did he have his name associated with ? A little while ago he was a member, of a Government which submitted a Bill to give to Great Britain a mere shadow of preference - on less than 000,000 worth of imports - which would have been of hardly any value to her. The right honorable gentleman, as an Imperialist, possesses a great regard for the mother country. I think if I called myself an Imperialist I should be a more genuine preferential trader than that ; I  ould  be prepared to make some sacrifice by way of proving the genuine nature of mv Imperial spirit. But the  right  honorable gentleman does not want to make any sacrifice. I cannot understand a man who professes protectionist principles being a preferential trader at all. We heard him ma&#39;ke some remarks on leaving office about the naval subsidy, which I think will be found at the&#39; bottom of his breaking with the Government. He is mainly responsible for, and is rather proud of, the fact that Australia is paying annually ^200,000 , - &#39;that is nearly one-fourth of our total outlay on defence - to Great Britain as a naval subsidy. He complains of the Prime. Minister having expressed some dissatisfaction with the Naval Agreement. But he must know perfectly well that the original dissatisfaction with it was expressed by .the Admiral on the Australian station-Admiral  Fanshawe  - sometime before the Prime Minister referred to the matter. If the right honorable gentleman makes this an excuse for leaving the Government I want to know why he did not challenge the Prime Minister when the honorable and learned gentleman, to his knowledge, wrote the following despatch on the 28th August, 1905, to the Secretary of State - </para>

                        <para>The Naval Commander-in-Chief, Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir A.</inline> Fanshawe,  has recently criticised this Agreement on several public occasions in order to support his contention that our contribution, as there fixed, is altogether insufficient. Since, as vet, only three payments have been made . . . this appeal for an alteration of its terms might be deemed premature. But as it may indicate a dissatisfaction with the agreement shared by the Lords of the Admiralty, as well as by their official representatives - </para>

                    <para>This is the passage on which I wish to lay stress - and as a similar dissatisfaction, though upon other grounds, exists here, it may be advantageous to commence its reconsideration without delay. The paramount importance of the Navy to the British Empire and to Australia may be taken to be freely admitted. Nothing in this despatch is intended to question it. Indeed, our obligations to share in the general defence of the Empire have been already recognised in practice and in principle. </para>
                    <para>It the right honorable member for Swan was opposed to the discontinuance of the Naval Agreement he should have protested against the sending of this despatch to the old country. Here is another unequivocal sentence - </para>

                        <para>It has been approved only in default of a better means of indicating our acceptance of Imperial responsibilities. Whatever may be the assumed basis upon which our contribution is there determined, it is regarded as merely an arbitrary proportion of an existing expenditure. Whatever the intention may have been, this attempt at joint naval action has failed to enlist a fraction of the support that was spontaneously accorded in all the States to the despatch of military contingents to South Africa. On this account, the question why the Naval Agreement is coldly regarded here appears serious enough to merit careful scrutiny. There is much truth in the customary interpretation that its want of popularity is due to the fact that, except to the small extent permitted by Articles V., VI., and VII., none of our grant is applied to any distinctively Australian purpose. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable member for Swan is very proud of the Naval Agreement. He is its author, and he ought to be proud of it. He is proud that we are handing over one-fifth of our annual defence expenditure to an authority over which we have absolutely no control. Some time ago he approached the Admiralty in an endeavour to secure some sort of joint control over the Squadron in our waters during time of peace. </para>

                            <para>- I would reply that when four members from Western Australia were sitting in the Opposition corner, five years ago, fighting strenuously in order to get low duties in favour of the primary industries, the right honorable member voted against us every time. If a duty of 25 per cent, on mining machinery was desirable in the mind of the right honorable member five years ago, how can he say that it is not a desirable duty now? </para>

                            <para>- I cannot pause to discuss these fine fiscal distinctions. I must say that there is good ground for the complaint about the silence of the Government in regard to the Naval Agreement. It appears to me that there is somebody outside this Parliament who knows more about the negotiations than do the Ministers themselves. This House is entitled to more definite and exact information in regard to the Naval Agreement, and should not be treated to the shuffling methods which the Government have adopted ever since we met. Several questions have been asked regarding this Agreement, but none of the Ministers seem to know anything of the matter, or, if they do, they refuse to say what they know. Outside, however, most remarkable to say, there is a gentleman named Richard Hain, who, apparently, has a more intimate knowledge of the subject than the members of the Government. He has been contributing articles in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> from which one can only infer that he possesses knowledge  which the House should have received from  the Government at first hand. </para>

The source of the information of the &#34;Daily Chronicle &#34; was not hard to find, but a direct question put to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> &#34; Have you withdrawn?&#34; got the just as direct answer &#34;No; but I think the Federal Parliament will,&#34; and in that answer rests . the whole mystery. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin&#39;s</inline> attitude in the conference was neither that of a delegate, nor of a plenipotentiary. He put forward his case fully, and pressed it home. Instead of finding hostility at the Admiralty, he found a keen desire to meet him. </para>

                    <para class="block">All I can say is, that none of these facts appear in the official report, or in the newspapers, which were supplied with a semi-official report, and how they have managed to filter through to this gentleman is more than I can explain. I should not have said a word about this matter, except that the article contains proof in itself that the information is accurate - that the writer has some reliable information not possessed by this House, and I am very doubtful whether it is possessed by Ministers. How does the writer know this - </para>

                            had admitted the over lordship of the Admiralty, which means the continuance of the subsidy, but which also leaves Australia free to build up her own independent coastal defence and training ships.&#34; It is a kind of combination of the two policies, and a recognition of the rights of both. It throws upon Australia the burden of harbor defence, the control of the smaller vessels, and probably means also using these as a training school from which the larger ships under the Imperial control may recruit their crews. It throws upon the Admiralty the burden of maintaining the control of the Western Pacific outside the harbors. That is, it necessarily leaves to the British Navy the providing of large cruisers. . . . It concentrates the, perhaps, home-made home controlled flotilla, and relieves it of the outlook into the outer seas. It relieves the British Navy of harbor defence, while at the same time it provides the Navy with an effective base. It also means more expenditure by the Australian taxpayer.

                <para class="block">I desire to say that in consequence of certain observations made this evening in the course of the Budget debate I feel called upon to repeat the statement made by me on more than one occasion, that it is at the express desire of the Prime Minister that I have refrained from outlining the negotiations with the Admiralty regarding the Naval Agreement. I thought I had made it clear to every honorable member that the Prime Minister himself wishes to deal with the question upon his return. But for that fact I should have made a statement on the subject. I am familiar with the matters to which the honorable member for Coolgardie has referred. . I know who was responsible for the partly private sittings of the Conference, and why they took place. If the honorable member knew the facts he would agree that it was right that certain statements should be made in private, and that the official report has not been manipulated in the sense in which that word may sometimes be used. There are occasions when the Imperial Government consider it unwise to give to the world their intentions in regard to certain matters. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to be drawn into a discussion of the matter. I have told the House why I have refrained from dealing with the question, and I think that the majority of honorable members are satisfied. They know that the Prime Minister is at all times honest in his declarations, and it is not quite fair to hurl imputations at the Government for not having before dealt with, this matter. I felt to-night, whilst listening to the remarks made by the honorable member for Coolgardie, that certain criticisms were unfair to the Government, and to the Prime Minister, who, I&#39; am sorry to say, is not yet well enough to be in attendance here. </para>

                    <para>. I wish to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General a statement contained in a letter placed in my hands to the effect that the wages of carpenters engaged in the telegraph pole yard, Sturt-street, South Melbourne, have been reduced from  10s.  per day to  8s.  per day. I understand that men engaged in performing the same class of work in Sydney are paid  11s.  per day. If the Public Service Commissioner has reduced, the wages of these carpenters, I think that he has ignored the desire of the House and of the community at large. Surely a carpenter, as an educated artisan, is worth more than  8s.  a day? That, I understand, is the rate of pay received by labourers in the employ of the Commonwealth. I may add that, in bringing this matter under the notice of the Postmaster&#39;General, I am acting in conjunction with the honorable member for Bourke. </para>

As to the pole-dressers, to whom reference has been made by the honorable member for Melbourne, I may say that I issued orders to the effect that all casual hands should receive the rates of pay enjoyed by workers outside the Department, and that my minute resulted in the raising of the wages of these casual hands from 8s. to 10s. per day. The Commissioner subsequently determined to appoint permanent men to these positions, and he classified their work as being, that, not of carpenters or shipwrights, but of labourers, and fixed the rate of pay at 8s. per day. </para>

                        <para>- I have represented to the Public Service Commissioner that this is skilled labour, and that it should be paid for at the rate of 10s. per day. But I have no control over that officer&#39;s classification, and he considers that his expert advice is of such a character that he cannot authorize the payment of more than 8s. per day. He is now calling for applications for permanent employes at that rate. I have told him that I do not consider that that is a fair wage for the work. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to make a personal explanation. I understand that, during my absence, as well as after I put in an appearance to- night, the honorable member for Coolgardie referred to me and criticised me on account of several votes which he said I gave upon the Tariff several years ago. He seemed to desire to prove that I shall be inconsistent if I do not vote now exactly in the same way as I did more than five years ago. It is a well-known rule that members of Parliament who join Governments have to sink their individual opinions in many respects - but not, of course, in matters affecting their consciences, or which are so grave as to necessitate their separating themselves from their colleagues. A member of a Cabinet cannot, consistently with the loyal support which he owes -to his colleagues, absent himself from divisions. But I have no objection now to saying that, in regard to some of the excessive duties of the old Tariff, as well as in regard to some other minor matters, I held certain opinions not fully shared by my colleagues. Every one who has anything to do with Governments, or with companies, or with business of any kind, knows, however, that every one has to sink his individual views to some extent. For the honorable member to parade votes which he states I gave as a subordinate member of the Government, in loyalty to my colleagues, who were ina majority in that Government, and to base upon those votes a charge of inconsistency against me, was, I think, as unnecessary as it was unfair. . </para>

                        <para>- Yes, certainly it was, but there are many grades of protection. I repeat that a man who joins a Government is compelled to be loyal to his colleagues, and may not always wholly approve of what is proposed. I have never been an excessive protectionist. I am a good moderate protectionist, but not a prohibitionist. I feel myself at liberty at the present time - five years after the other Tariff was dealt with - to do what I consider, under the existing conditions of Australia, to be right and just to my State and&#39; the Commonwealth, and not to be unduly bound by votes which, under other circumstances, I then gave in concert with those with whom I was associated. </para>

                        <para>- No, I did not. The honorable member should not jump to such conclusions. What I said was that I recognised that the people of Australia have declared for protection, and that I would not stand in the way of giving effect to their decision. I  recognise that a certain amount of protection is considered to be necessary, but I am not going to vote for heavy duties on appliances used in the primary industries ; nor shall I vote, in any case, for protectionist duties, unless they are accompanied by proper protection being given to the worker and the consumer. </para>

                    <para>. - One or two questions have been put to me, which I desire to answer. In reference to the extension of the dinner hour all that I have to say is that the necessity exists whether the Tariff is under consideration or not. The reason why the extension of time was made was that the suspension of the sitting for a bare hour did not afford honorable members an opportunity to go from the House to their residences to dinner. Some honorable members were very anxious for the slight extension of time, and I cannot say that the Government are prepared to make any change at present. In reference to the question put to me by the honorable member for Lang, I have to say that the health of the Prime Minister is improving. But, at the same time, I do not think that it would do him any good to read some of the things which have taken place tonight. Honorable members know the PrimeMinister&#39;s character just as well as I do. </para>
