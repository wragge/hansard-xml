                        <para>- It frequently happens that telephone subscribers are informed - that they have been rung up by other subscribers who have given their numbers ; but it is often impossible to" ascertain to whom these numbers belong. Will the Postmaster-General, therefore, in issuing future lists of subscribers, adopt the practice which formerly prevailed in Victoria, of printing subscribers' names in numerical as well as alphabetical order, so that a reference to to the directory will show at a glance who is the lessee of any particular telephone? I think that many subscribers would be ready to pay a small sum for this information, if it could be given without extra expense. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause gives the Commonwealth authorities very extensive powers. I admit that whatever authority is appointed to deal with such matters as quarantine and the preservation of the public health should be clothed with the fullest powers, for use in times of emergency, and we must trust that a wise discretion will be exercised in their use and administration. Whatever powers we give to a Commonwealth Department, they should be full and complete for the proper administration of the matters with which we wish that Department to deal. But I doubt, if it be wise to give, at the present time, such large powers as are conferred by the Bill. I am not sure that we have the constitutional right to endow any Commonwealth Department with such powers. Therefore, the Government would do well to accept a reasonable compromise. It would not be right to put the States to the trouble of showing that this Parliament had exceeded its powers, and it would be a reflection upon us if the High Court ruled any of the provisions of a Commonwealth Act to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> Therefore, we should try to ascertain exactly what is our constitutional position in this matter. Not even the Attorney-General has shown that the Commonwealth Parliament can legislate with respect to more than the quarantining of human beings and animals. A memorandum upon a report by the Public Health Department of New South Wales has been placed before us, which contains this paragraph - </para>

                    <para>I think that the meaning of the word " quarantine" is pretty well known. There is no doubt that leaving the sub-clause as it is preserves to every State the power that it now has to make laws in relation to all such subjects. It does not vest an exclusive power in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Commonwealth to pass such laws. The State can pass its own law, and alter it as it pleases; but I think it as well to do as was done in the Canadian Act in that respect, to give a power which the Commonwealth might, in case of emergency, employ for the sake of the general health- -power to make a law respecting quarantine, as it is generally understood, so as to preserve all the ports of the Commonwealth, not only from infection from abroad, but also from the danger of any infection which might have reached one port of the Commonwealth spreading to the rest of the Commonwealth. I think that there is no great harm in retaining the word " quarantine," and that, if we were to eliminate this word, the day might come when we would very much  regret  having done so. </para>
                    <para>The  Hon. R. E.. E. O'Connor : The sub-clause as it stands now provides for the quarantine of animals. </para>
                    <para>The  Hon.  I. A. Isaacs : I believe it would include the quarantine of animals if those animals when slaughtered would go . into consumption as food, and might thereby affect the public health. </para>
                    <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">Hon. Dr. Cockburn</inline> : What about the quarantine of dogs? </para>
                    <para>The  Hon.  I. A. Isaacs : I think that the Federal Parliament should have the power to deal with this matter if it thinks fit to do so. </para>

                <para class="block">I quote this to show that when the Constitution was being framed, the idea of quarantine did not extend to plants or goods. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor</inline> withdrew his amendment after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> and others had spoken ; but none of the latter hinted for. a moment that paragraph 11 conferred anything like the extensive powers proposed under this Bill.. Under the circumstances, it would be wise, I think, for the Government to take some notice of the States' protests, and to come to the conclusion that there ought to be a central Commonwealth body or Bureau of Immigration established, which should be assimilated with, or take over, the States bodies now administering the quarantine regulations in relation to oversea communication. When a ship arrives within the 'Commonwealth the central authority should nave the power to inspect it, and, if there be either plants or any other classes of goods on board likely to spread disease, the Federal authority should have power to impound them or deal with them as the occasion requires. But once the ship has been passed, and the goods or plants taken into a State on a certificate to the effect that they are clean, then the States should be left to deal with them under their own local regulations. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarilv. If the Commonwealth, in the first place, only dealt with oversea quarantine, I do not think there would be any conflict, because the Commonwealth, although acting as the central authority, would utilize the States officers, just as these officers are now utilized. In my opinion, we have not the constitutional power to include plants and animals within the operation of this Bill; and if we have not the power, it would not be wise for us to assume that we have. The States are already protesting against our action ; and to take the proposed powers under the circumstances, would only give further reason for what, perhaps, may be unnecessary disquiet. That is not what we desire. Possibly we are the powerful body, but, if so, we ought to make a generous use of our power, and thereby strengthen the confidence which the States ought to have in the Commonwealth. This is not a party matter, and there is no need for the Ministry to endeavour to win a party battle. We are all satisfied, up to a certain point, that the object of the Bill is commendable, and that the measure is a good one. I ask the Government not to go any further .than I have suggested at the present juncture, because, in view of the fact that the States are now doing the work exceedingly well, there is no urgency. The last paragraph of the memorandum is as follows - </para>

                    <para>The Vegetation Diseases Acts of the States are not affected as regards the extirpation or treatment of diseases. The advantages of local legislation and administration are admitted. This Bill, so far from diminishing their usefulness, will superimpose national measures for isolating and localizing these diseases where, from the nature of the case, State action is likely to be ineffective. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That goes to show that there is no need for- the Commonwealth to take the proposed power at the present time. If there is no urgency, why should the Commonwealth, simply because, possibly, it may have the power, seek to pass this measure in the face of the opposition of the States, with whom we ought to try to work harmoniously ? If we introduce a system which works well the States will be all the more ready to nana ( over further powers.  to us when occasion requires, which will be quite soon enough for the Commonwealth to assume the responsibility. If the Bill be passed as it now stands, the Government may be led to incur greater expense than the Treasurer anticipates. When he introduced the Bill, the honorable gentleman said he. did not anticipate there would be  any  additional expenditure; and if the Commonwealth confines its attention to oversea matters, and eliminates plants: and goods, we might obtain a very effective administration, probably at less cost, and certainly at very little more cost, than at present. There would be more effective  control,  because the central authority could arrange that a ship which had got pratique at Perth, could continue the voyage round to Sydney without further molestation. Under the present arrangement it frequently happens that a ship is inspected at each port, and the owners thereby put to much inconvenience and expense ; while the new arrangement I have indicated would be a great convenience to shipping, business, and lead to better administration from a Commonwealth point of view. Such a desirable result, in itself, affords another reason why we should not go- any further than is actually necessary at the present time. If we persist in going further, there must sooner or later be a duplication of officers. For instance, if the Commonwealth thought, it right to assume the functions of' a State Department in opposition to a State's wishes, how could the Commonwealth ask that Department to act at any time? There would have to be fresh officers appointed; and, as I say, there must, sooner or later, be duplication. The fruit industry of. Tasmania, for instance, has been built up gradually, and is now under stringent and effective control by local bodies, who make their own regulations, appoint inspectors, and impose penalties. If diseased apples are allowed on trees a penalty is imposed; and every precaution is taken to keep orchard's clean, and to export only the best and soundest of fruit. The regulations go so far as to insist on cases, which may have been taken to the wharf, being dipped in boiling water before being returned to the. grower, There are different regulations in different neighbourhoods as the local conditions require ; and the local bodies are doing their work thoroughly and enthusiastically, and far better than it could be done from the distant office of a central body.. </para>

                        <para>- It is not proposed to interfere with it;, but if the Bill be passed, in its present form, it will certainly give the Commonwealth power to interfere with it. I say that there is no necessity for us to interfere, and the Government might very well limit the scope of the measure in the way I have indicated. To my mind, they would be acting wisely bv so doing. For instance, it is well known that the fruit-growers in the Huon district were called upon to take up land which was covered by dense and heavy vegetation. They have laboriously cleared that land, but even now it is practically valueless for anything save fruit growing. In many instances their whole lives have been devoted to assuring themselves a livelihood in this way. If their lands are interfered with as the result of some regulation, or if the industry in which they are engaged be threatened, they will have nothing to fall back upon. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. But seeing that, in these particular matters, the States are discharging their duty so well, why should we interfere with their administration? What authority can do better than Queensland is doing in respect of the tick pest? I would be the last to urge the Commonwealth to. surrender its powers in any way. But because it has a giant's strength', there is no need why it should use it like a viant. In view of the fact that the States are  efiiciently  discharging their duty in the matter of preventing the introduction of pests and? of disease, why not - seeing that this is at non-party measure - allow the Government to take unto itself powers of quarantine in respect of oversea ships and animals - which involve no constitutional question - leaving the control of plants and goods to the States, except at the ports of entry ? </para>

                        <para>- If the Bill be passed in its present form, the Commonwealth may, with the very best of intentions, do a vast injury to the fruit-growing industry, to which I have already referred. It has been said that the authorities in Queensland were somewhat lax in their efforts to deal with the tick pest. That may have been true in the early stages of the disease, but as soon as it was accurately diagnosed, and its effect thoroughly appreciated, that State was most active in its efforts to combat it. The Commonwealth could not have done better than Queensland has done during the past few years in attempting to cope with that frightful scourge. I hope that the Government will adopt the view which I am expressing. I am sure that they can do so without any loss of prestige. I am satisfied that by acting in the way I have suggested they will be taking a wise step. As the occasion arises, we can afterwards proceed to legislate to the full extent of our powers if the interests of the Commonwealth, or of the States, should demand it. </para>

                    <para>.- Every member of the Committee will agree with me that one of the most important functions which we were led to assume would be undertaken by the Federation was that of quarantine. It is perfectly clear that the work of oversea quarantine can be most efficiently discharged by the Commonwealth, and I hold that one of the fundamental objects underlying the purpose of Federation was that the Commonwealth should discharge those duties which it could fulfil more effectually than could any of the individual States. Consequently I was of opinion that it would be a mistake for the Commonwealth to interfere with the local conditions obtaining in the various States, and with the arrangements which those States have already made. But I must confess that a closer consideration of this question has led me to believe that the Commonwealth should, in the interests of the public health, exercise such powers as would enable it - if by any mischance any of the States neglected to discharge their duties - to assert its authority. I do not think it can be laid to the charge of any State that it has neglected that primary duty. But at the present moment the States rightly or wrongly entertain the view that the Commonwealth Government has introduced a Bill which, possibly, has a tendency to very seriously dislocate their internal arrangements. Consequently they say, "We ask you to delay consideration of this measure before coming to a final decision upon it." I think that without any loss of prestige the Government might have given greater consideration than they have done to the representations which have been made by the different States in this connexion. Representative bodies, whose members are desirous of seeing quarantine arrangements effectively carried out, have also requested the Government to delay the consideration of this measure until they have had an opportunity of making representations in regard to it. Protests in regard to it have come from Brisbane, from Sydney, and from various organizations in Melbourne. The Commonwealth has been six years in existence without undertaking the very important duties of quarantine, and if there has been no need for it to exercise these powers during that period, it cannot be said that there is any extreme urgency for their exercise now, or to push this matter to its final conclusion immediately. </para>

                        <para>-  I will assist the Government to make the Bill an effective one in regard to oversea quarantine. In my view the object of giving this Parliament power to legislate in respect of quarantine was that it might control oversea shipping in that regard. That is the opinion which would probably be expressed by the "man in the street" who has not grasped the necessity which exists to protect the public health, whether in respect of human, animal, or plant life. I hold that disease detrimental to the public health may be introduced  by means of animal and plant life just as easily as small-pox or plague may be introduced. I am sorry that the Minister in charge of the Bill is not present, because, notwithstanding the assurances which he gave yesterday - assurances which undoubtedly modified the opinions entertained by a number of honorable members, and made those members more favorably disposed towards the Bill - I wish earnestly to suggest that whereas these enlarged powers may be secured by the Government, they should be accompanied by a declaration that they will not be exercised except in respect of oversea quarantine. The Commonwealth authorities should have power to follow up any importation into a State under conditions which are thought likely to be detrimental to the public health, and which cannot be dealt with effectively by the States themselves. But while I feel that it is desirable that the Commonwealth should be able to take such action in cases of emergency, I think that we ought to have from the Minister an assurance that these additional powers will not be exercised in any other circumstances. It is true that the Minister could not bind the actions of his successors. I. hold that the kernel of the position rests in the Federation having the most ample power, but refraining from exercising it beyond a certain point, except in an emergency.. </para>

                        <para>-  They are effectively carrying out the duties with which they are charged, but cases may arise in which action on the part of the central governing authority is necessary to guard the public health. I should be prepared to clothe the 'Commonwealth with the power not only to deal with oversea quarantine, but to step in and deal with Inter-State quarantine in cases of emergency, or when the States concerned were not taking reasonable precautions to safeguard the public health. I do. not propose to traverse the ground which has been so well covered by members of the legal profession in the House. I would not presume to deal with the constitutional aspect of this question, but I may say at once that I think the Commonwealth should be prepared to take considerable risks from the constitutional stand-point, in order that the health of the people may! be safeguarded. The provisions of this Bill go to the very foundation qf the measures necessary for the preservation of the health of the people, and consequently, notwithstanding legal quibbles that may be  raised  I am certainly disposed to say that we should be prepared to take some risk in the interest of the nation as  a  whole. While the proposal that the Commonwealth should have Dower to quarantine plant life is regarded as being somewhat of an innovation, I think it is a power that should be possessed bv it in order that the spread of disease mav be avoided. At the same time, it should be exercised only when the States themselves fail to take proper precautions. </para>

                        <para>-  I have not seen that amendment, but am glad to learn that steps are to be taken in the direction I have indicated. The limitation I suggest would be a wise one to impose. I trust that we shall be careful in dealing with this measure not to place any new obstacles in the way of trade and commerce between our various ports. It is admitted that the method of supervision so long in force in many countries is being 'somewhat relaxed in Great Britain, or, at all events, at the port of London, and I hold that we should be very careful not to impose what may prove unnecessary restrictions upon the free entry of large numbers of people to Australia. As far as is consistent with our desire to preserve the public health, we should remove all barriers to such an inflow. The Other day my attention  wa3  drawn to an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> in July, 1901, and which dealt with this question in a very able and satisfactory way. Capable articles are often published in that newspaper, and evidently the management considered that this one was eminently satisfactory, since . they republished it <inline font-style="italic">in globo</inline> in the issue of Wednesday, 4th March, 1903. The position taken* up by the writer is a just, reasonable, and rational one. After dealing with the whole history of quarantine, the article proceeds - </para>

                    <para>The British quarantine procedure, it will be seen, is eminently suited to modern requirements. It may be said to provide the maximum of precaution with the minimum of inconvenience, and hence on somewhat similar lines should that of Federated Australia be based. What is required is an efficient system of medical inspection for all vessels coming from infected ports, or vessels on board of which sickness has occurred during the voyage. This inspection should take place at the first port of call within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, and it is then that the quarantine precautions should be initiated. Now, as a rule, the three diseases most dreaded in Australia are small-pox, plague, and cholera. Their introduction is most to be feared from Indian and Chinese ports. The two first diseases named are, to a certain extent, now regarded as always more or less prevalent, and special precautions in this direction will be required. The method which will naturally suggest itself is that two Federal quarantine stations shall be established, the one for the purpose of supervising the health of vessels coming by our western ports, and this would have to be either Fremantle or Albany, and the other coming by the eastern ports, either at Thursday Island or Cooktown. The duty of the officers- deputed by the Federal Government to carry out the quarantine regulations would be to hold an effective inspection on the arrival of any vessel from an infected port, or having sickness on board. If, on examination, actual cases are found, then the patient or patients should be landed, and the usual precautions taken to prevent any spread of the disease. On the other hand, if the vessel is found to be free of disease, then a clean bill of health should be given that would prevent the trouble and waste of time that now frequently occurs in holding medical inspections at every Australian port at which an ocean-going steamer may call.  </para>

                        <para>- The view put forward by the writer is to my mind a very sound one.  His  contention is that the scope of Federal power should be limited to oversea quarantine, and that I believe was the original intention. My only justification for addressing the Committee, after the full and able debate to which we have listened, is my desire to emphasize the reasonableness of the plea put forward by the States Governments, who say, in effect, to us, " Do not dislocate the machinery that we have built up as the result of years o£ careful thought. Limit the Federal control to oversea quarantine, except in cases where it is necessary in the interests of public health to deal with Inter-State or Intra State quarantine." If the Minister makes it clear that the administration of the Bill will be limited in that way, I hope that the Committee will give the Government an effective measure, sufficient to enable them to cope with any contingency, and to deal with any failure on the part of one or more States to carry out these duties satisfactorily. </para>

The objection that the present precautions will be relaxed is met by the. statement of the Minister that he is willing to take over the existing State machinery. If that be done, and the machinery now controlled by. the States is effectively operated by the Commonwealth, great good will ensue. In the first place, the change will benefit the Governments of the States, by removing from their control Departments which are now a charge upon their revenues. Public men in the States have declared that the Commonwealth Government is a costly affair, and we have now to show them how they can save money by handing over certain Departments to Commonwealth control. </para>

                        <para>- Those whom I represent are almost wholly consumers, and they ask to be protected from disease likely to be conveyed by fruit and vegetables, as well as from disease likely to be conveyed by animals or man. I understand that the intention of the amendment is to limit the control of the Commonwealth to quarantine in respect to persons and goods coming from abroad or passing from State to State. In other words, those who support the amendment appear to be ready to go two-thirds of the way which the Government ask us to go. Why should they not go the remaining one-third of the distance, and give the Commonwealth power to interfere for the prevention of the spreading of disease within a State? I remember that, some years ago, it was found difficult to prevent the tick fever from getting into New South Wales from Queensland, notwithstanding the robust administration of the Agricultural Department of the former State. One gentleman, who was a Member of Parliament at the time, evaded the quarantine which was established by avoiding the well-known crossing places, and driving 1,700 remounts across the border by an unusual route. I do not pretend to possess any technical knowledge in regard to this measure; but I shall vote for the clause as it stands, in the desire to provide effectively for the stamping out. of disease in every part of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot altogether agree with the amendment. As it covers the whole ground of the present controversy, I shall not now say anything about the constitutional aspect of the question, or deal with more than the point immediately raised, as to our right to take powers for the prevention of the spreading of disease within a State, as well as for the prevention of the spreading of disease from one State to another. I hold that under the Constitution we can endow a Commonwealth Department with the full powers proposed to be conferred by the Bill ; but I am also of the opinion that expediency must weigh with us in considering the advisability of exercising our constitutional powers. We should be very loth to endeavour to exercise the powers which the Government have told us they, desire to exercise through the local health officers of the States, because we cannot expect to obtain the service from State officials that the States get from them. </para>

                        <para>- The provisions of the Commerce Act are not so far reaching and extensive as those of the Bill. Does the honorable gentleman propose that the Commonwealth should take over the Stock Departments of the States, and pay the salaries of their stock inspectors? If that were done, and similar action were taken in regard to the Health Departments of the States, we should have to alter our financial arrangements under the Braddon section. But while I hold that it would be expedient to ask State officers generally to administer internal quarantine, I feel that we ought not to limit our powers in any way. The necessity may arise in the future for exercising these powers to the fullest, either because the States have exceeded their powers of local quarantine, or because they have failed to sufficiently exercise them. This matter, however, can best be dealt with by. clause 13, and consequently I shall not speak at length in regard to it at this stage. I rose to ask a simple Question of the supporters of the amendment - I refer to the second proposal, to insert after the word " spread " the words " from State to State." It has been generally accepted by the Committee that the adoption of that amendment would limit the Commonwealth to providing for quarantine on the borders of the States. Let us consider whether, as a matter of strict fact, the amendment would have that result. If it were made, the clause would read - </para>

                <para class="block">A common-sense Court would interpret that provision to mean that, to "prevent".  the spread of disease from State to State, the Commonwealth could track it to its place of origin within any State. If a disease were allowed to spread through a State until it reached its boundaries, nothing the Commonwealth could do would  ' prevent ' ' it from spreading to adjoining States. Consequently, the reasonable interpretation of the provision would give the Commonwealth power to track down disease to its place of origin within a State, and to deal with it there by any system of quarantine which it might choose to adopt. </para>

It is not my purpose to offer a captious criticism upon it, but for the reasons I have given, I shall be compelled to vote against it. I reserve the right to so limit the power of the Commonwealth, under clause 13 as to make Intra-State quarantine effective only when a State has failed to take proper, action, or has exceeded its proper powers in regard to quarantine. </para>

                    <para>. - I was very much impressed by the views put forward by the honorable member for Angas yesterday. He gave the Committee much valuable information. We require a powerful central authority to regulate quarantine, and I shall support the Bill as nearly as possible as it stands. In Victoria, at one time, the care of the public health was in the charge of local bodies; but it was found that on occasions their members were afraid to exercise their powers for fear of offending persons in the district over which the Board had control. The Legislature, therefore, felt compelled to institute a central Board of Health, with power to override the local bodies, which have since been altogether wiped out, the Health Act now being administered by a central department located1 in Melbourne. This arrangement has been found to work well, and every one is pleased with the change, although, when first suggested, it was opposed by the local bodies. What is proposed by the Bill is a  similar change, although on a larger scale, and, similarly, the State Departments are objecting to the control of a central Commonwealth Department. </para>

                        <para>- It has more power than it originally possessed, and has done great good by exercising that power. Possibly it would do more good if its power were extended. We do not want to have in existence two sets of authorities. If we have both States Departments and a Commonwealth Department, the friction which will be caused should the Commonwealth Department attempt to coerce the States Departments will create more unpleasantness and ill-feeling than the transfer ' of the sole control to the Commonwealth. My view is that the Commonwealth should take over the Departments of Quarantine and Public Health. In my opinion, they would be better administered by one central authority than by independent State authorities. Has the Commonwealth been unable to properly administer the Departments of the Post Office,. Customs and Defence? Are those Departments not as well conducted as they were by the States ? I think they are. </para>

                    <para>-- There would appear to be- two questions before us. First, there is the constitutional question, which has been very exhaustively discussed by honorable members, who, in this House are, perhaps, the most capable of discussing it. I do not desire to go very far' into that question; but I find that the honorable member for Angas, in reply to an interjection by the honorable member for Parkes, said he was not sure whether the Commonwealth could constitutionally take up all the powers sought under the Bill, although he was prepared to " chance it." The honorable member for Kooyong was also prepared to say, " Let us .risk this departure." That, in my opinion, is a wrong attitude for the Committee to take. It would be more in consonance with the dignity of this Chamber for us to be sure of our ground before we move ; while any false step will only put us more and more in conflict with the States Governments, and invite captious criticism and litigation. So far as the word "quarantine" is concerned, I do not think there is any doubt that we have not the powers sought under the Bill. It has been argued, however,, that we have additional powers under the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce. I am willing to admit that a great deal that is not contained in the provision relating to quarantine may be found in the provision relating to trade and commerce. But we find that the regulations in regard to trade and commerce in Canada and the United States "are almost entirely, if not exclusively, in regard to Inter-State trade and matters of that description. The honorable member  who submits the amendment, and, I think, the majority of honorable members, are willing to give the Government power to regulate Inter-State quarantine. The only question on which we come into collision is whether we should exercise what are called the police function of the States in regard to matters within the States themselves. That is a course which, in my opinion, we are not called upon to take at the present time, even if we have the power. There are steps which may or may not be lawful, but which may not be expedient; and this, I think, is a step which it would be inexpedient for us to take, seeing that such matters can be better administered by the States than by a central authority. We all agree that there ought to be central administration in regard to what may be termed quarantine proper - that is maritime quarantine - so as to prevent the introduction of diseases dangerous to human, animal, or plant life. . These are matters which could be dealt with by the Commonwealth, and Parliament ought to take  the necessary power ; but when we come to interfere with the States in the exercise of their present powers - powers which, at any rate, the majority of the States are exercising well at the present time - we are on- another footing altogether. There would be much difficulty in administering the law if we took the full powers proposed in the Bill. The Acting Prime Minister, when he introduced the measure, said - </para>

                    <para>I frankly confess that it has been found somewhat difficult to devise a means of doing this effectively and inexpensively, and I hope that when the Bill becomes law we shall find it possible to work harmoniously with the States.  </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">As to taking over the machinery of the States, I understand from what the Acting Prime Minister said, that he referred to the quarantine stations and to the health officers, more especially those employed in these stations. I do hot think for a moment that the Acting Prime Minister proposes to take over the administration of the Public Health Acts, the Nuisance Prevention Acts, the Cattle Slaughtering Acts, the Stock Acts, the Fruit Pests Acts, and' similar statutes of the different States ; it is inconceivable that the Commonwealth could administer those Acts in the way they are being administered at the present time. All those powers ought to be left to the States, which possess all the necessary administrative machinery. The States Governments have at their disposal the municipal councils, and the health officers appointed by the councils, and also the police, who are often used in enforcing regulations made under such Acts as I have mentioned. The Commonwealth  could not avail itself of this administrative machinery, and could not supersede it ; the only course open would be to either duplicate the machinery, or leave ourselves absolutely in the hands of the States. </para>

                    <para>.- Even after the lengthy discussion which has taken place, I feel somewhat in doubt as to what course I shall take with regard to the amendment. We have had two or three splendid addresses from the legal point of view; but the speakers  appear  to be in conflict upon a very important point. The amendment of the honorable member for Angas commended itself to my judgment ; but an equally eminent' member of the legal profession, the honorable member for Bendigo, told us that if we adopt the amendment it will simply shatter many of the subsequent clauses of the Bill. We have no desire to bring about that result - we would rather accept the measure, and endeavour to make it perfect. I apprehend that the desire of the Committee is to assist the Government in carrying into effect what is undoubtedly an essential part of our constitutional powers. But there appears to rae some doubt as to what the Bill is de-' signed to accomplish. Legal members have presented the Bill to us as one containing powers designed to be concurrent with certain powers which the States will possess, even if the Bill becomes law, and will still continue to exercise. That was certainly not the view presented to us by the Acting Prime Minister when he introduced the Bill. I have the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the honorable gentleman's speech, and it seems clear from what he said that the intention of the Government is to take over the whole control of quarantine The honorable gentleman said - </para>

                <para class="block">Consequently it is clear that in the opinion of the Acting Prime Minister we are going to take over the whole- power of quarantine, so that in future no power in that connexion will be vested in the States.

                <para class="block">Therefore the intention of the Bill is that the Commonwealth shall assume absolute control of all quarantine arrangements, including the internal control hitherto exercised by the States. To my mind, it is perfectly clear that if we do take over these functions we shall have done very little more than take over quarantine arrangements so far as the ports of entry are concerned, because no provision has been made by the States for the quarantining of districts or portions of a State. If anything of that sort becomes necessary, action is invariably taken by their Stock Departments, and not under quarantine regulations. Therefore I think we may accept this Bill, which is particularly designed to assume control over existing quarantine arrangements, and from that stand-point I am prepared to support the Government proposal. I believe that this work can be discharged to better advantage by the Commonwealth than it is under present conditions, which appear to me to be likely to create difficulties. Only in to-day's newspapers a report is published of a discussion which has just taken place in the South Australian Parliament. That discussion had reference to the introduction of the fruit fly, and to the objection which is entertained by the State authorities to the importation of apples from New South Wales. Some honorable members of the South Australian Parliament expressed the fear that if the State Government prohibited the introduction of apples from New South Wales because of the presence of fruit fly there, the latter State would resort to reprisals by refusing to allow fruit from South Australia to enter Broken Hill. That is one of the difficulties which is always likely to arise where conflicting authorities exist, and, in matters affecting the whole of the States, I am inclined to think that it will be in the interest of the general community to secure administration by the Commonwealth. Of course, it may happen that, owing to the establishment of a central authority, we shall not be in a position to secure prompt action in certain" cases. That is one of the difficulties associated with the establishment of an authority which is called upon to govern a very large area. The danger which I apprehend is that, in some instances, a disease may evidence itself in one portion of a State, and before the central authority can be induced to move the area of infection may become enlarged, so that it will be more difficult to cope with it than it would have been if action had been taken earlier. That, however, is a matter of administration. Unfortunately, Government Departments are proverbially slow to move. I do not know whether they are quite so slow as the average man credits them with being, but I do know that, in many instances, it is very difficult to get them to move. In cases where disease becomes manifest, and requires to be grappled with expeditiously, we must take care that our organization is such that its services may be called into active exercise at the earliest possible moment. I am quite prepared to support the Bill. Concerning the amendment, I scarcely know what action to take. Upon its face, I feel inclined to agree to it. But I should like to hear from some member of the legal profession how it would be likely to affect the Bill, because I do not desire the prediction of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo to be realized. We must be careful to guard against that, and, therefore, as a layman, I should like to hear a further expression of opinion upon the subject. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall support the amendment. The Acting Prime Minister states that he has an amendment which he may move, but he declines to say whether or not he will move it until clause 13 is under consideration. I do not think that this Committee actually wishes the Commonwealth to interfere with the internal arrangements made by the States in respect of health matters and the control of pests. The position I take up is that I desire to see the Commonwealth assume the control of quarantine matters in regard to oversea shipping and as between State and State. But I would point out that if we undertake control of the matters which are now dealt with by the State authorities under their Quarantine Acts, we shall not deal with one tithe of the subjects over which they exercise supervision. If we are going to deal with diseases in fruit, why should we not deal with slaughtering operations, and with other matters affecting the public health, which, in some States, are incorporated in their Police Acts, in others in their Vegetation Diseases Acts, and in still others in their Pests Acts? The object of the major portion of this Bill commands the support of honorable members, but I would ask them to recollect that in all the States pests have been dealt with by special legislation. When the Acting Prime Minister tells us that he intends to take over the existing State machinery in relation to quarantine, he overlooks the fact that the larger portion of that machinery is not included in the States Quarantine Acts, but in their Codlin Moth Acts, their Vegetation Diseases Acts, and their Pests Acts. Consequently, we shall have to devise special machinery to give effect to the provisions of this Bill. In dealing with these matters, it occurs to me that it would be well for us to have regard to the experience of other countries. I do not know of any Federation which has assumed control over all these subjects to the extent that we are invited to do. After an experience of  100  years, the United States of America has left them entirely in the hands of the States Legislatures. That is the case, notwithstanding that in America plagues have been experienced for nearly a century, and the question of quarantine has come into very much greater prominence than it has in Australia. Matters of local concern, can, in my judgment, be dealt with better by local boards than by a central authority. Our States Parliaments have found that local bodies can deal with pests such as those to which I have referred better than can the State authorities themselves. In the industry in which I  am  particularly interested, in order to cope with various diseases, it has been found necessary to re- move the power of control from the central State authority, and to vest it in local bodies. To that end, local fruit boards have been established which have been granted enormous powers. These have discharged their functions better than any central authority - whether Federal or State - could hope to discharge them. It may be news to some honorable members to learn that in Tasmania these Fruit Boards have power to tax orchards up to10s. per acre, in addition to all State and municipal taxation. The object of granting them this power is to enable them to insist upon the orchards being kept clean. Yet even there it is not possible to secure uniform control. For instance, one Board has found it necessary to make spraying operations compulsory, whilst in a neighbouring district it has not been deemed desirable to insist upon compulsory spraying. In Tasmania, very stringent legislation exists in regard to the internal arrangements of the State. For instance, the Codlin Moth Act, which was amended in  1891,  makes it penal for any orchardist to convey from one part of the. State to another - that is, from his own orchard to his own yard, if there be a highway intervening - any infected fruit. That fruit must be destroyed in the orchard itself. At varying periods inspectors visit the orchards, and if diseased fruit be found in them the offender is fined. The orchardists are thus obliged to employ a number of boys and girls to pick diseased fruit from time to time, and to destroy it. What machinery will the Federal authority have to carry out any such arrangement ? I repeat that the legislation dealing with these fruit pests is not embodied in the quarantine law  of the States, but in such Acts as the Codlin Moth Act, the Vegetation Diseases Act, and the Pests Acts, and we have no power under a general Quarantine Bill to' take over the arrangements made by the States in connexion with the suppression of these pests. </para>

                        <para>- Do I understand from the Attorney-General that it is not proposed under this measure to interfere with the local boards appointed by the States to prevent the spread of insect pests? I greatly fear the power to issue regulations proclaiming any district a quarantine district. The Federal authorities will have power by regulation to proclaim any orchard or any part of a district a quarantine district, and as long as the quarantine continues, not one bushel of fruit may be sent to or from that district. If, as the result of an outbreak at Glenorchy or Bridgewater, those places were declared a quarantine district, the only right of way between the whole of the Derwent Valley district and Hobart, its sole port of shipment, would be closed. Not a bushel of apples could pass through that quarantine district, and the result would be that the whole of the fruit produced there would have to rot in the orchards. We' are assured that no Minister would think of taking so drastic a step. The Minister has told us that he does not in- tend to do. anything of the kind. But in framing such a measure as this, we should take care to give the authorities no more power than we think, they ought to possess. We should not have regard to any question of whether the Minister who would be called upon to administer it is favorable or unfavorable to the industries to which it relates. I am sure that honorable members do not think that the Commonwealth authorities should have power to inflict an absolute wrong upon all the fruit-growers in a district by proclaiming a quarantined area in the circumstances I have stated. It is not necessary for us to give such powers to the Government. The States Governments themselves have found that it is sufficient to confer on local boards the power to do all that is necessary for the protection of the industries to which they relate. " In Tasmania local bodies, created under Acts which will not be affected bv this measure, have the most extensive and far-reaching powers. They can compel a man to keep his orchard clean, and if he refuses to do so their officers may enter that orchard, and destroy the trees in it. Is anything further necessary ? Under this Bill we might have a regulation applying to the whole of the States, and, in passing, I may say that I am inclined to think sometimes that the demand for uniformity is destined to become almost a curse in Australia. We might have a regulation that was quite applicable to Queensland or New South Wales, although its effect on other States would be disastrous. The authorities might frame a regulation suitable to Tasmania, but wholly inapplicable to the conditions prevailing in other States. When the danger of uniformity in this respect is brought under the notice of the authorities," they reply at once,, " We cannot differentiate between the States. We must have uniform regulations." The demand for uniformity in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department is carried to an extent to which .no business mam would be a party. The United States of America have found it wise to refuse in many cases to pass uniform regulations. The varied climatic conditions of that vast continent render uniformity impossible. In Australia we have an even greater variety of climatic, conditions, and since as the result of an experience extending oyer 100 years, the Government of the United </para>

                <para class="block">States have found it absolutely necessary to leave wholly and solely to the States the passing of regulations relating to the quarantining of fruit pests, I think that we should be prepared to follow their example. Some of the ablest constitutional authorities in the House have declared that the Government are proposing to go beyond their power in this respect. But I do not intend .to deal with the constitutional aspect of this question. I recognise that there are certain functions relating to quarantine which the Commonwealth should exercise. I think that every honorable member is prepared to give the Federal Government power to deal with the general question of oversea and Inter-State quarantine, and surely it would be wise for the Minister to refrain from seeking additional power at the present time. Throughout the electorate which I represent there is a feeling of unrest in connexion with this proposal. Their experience of the working of the Commerce Act has not been such as to lead them to believe that further interference, on the part of the Federation, with local matters is by any means desirable. This Bill, in so far as it deals with pests affecting plant life, is of the utmost importance to orchardists. We are dealing here with the very bread and butter of men who have carved out for themselves homes in the bush. Everything they possess is repre'sented by their orchards. They have made a success of their industry without State assistance, and they simply ask us to leave them, alone. They have shown that they can manage their own affairs far better than the Federal authorities could hope to do. They have done much better than even the State Governments could hope to do in taking measures to preserve their industry from the various pests that from time to time assail it. It is because of this that the Government of Tasmania have seen fit to vest the local boards with complete powers, and those powers are 'exercised in order to preserve the industry, in which members of the boards, and those whom they represent, have embarked practically every penny they possess. We need not fear that such men are not likely to take the necessary steps to prevent the introduction of pests calculated to sweep away their' means of earning a livelihood. We know from bitter experience that Government interference in these local matters has been attended by disastrous results. The Acting Prime Minister has said that it is not the  intention of the Federal Government to interfere with the local bodies ; but is it wise to pass a law with the deliberate intention that no machinery to give effect to it shall be created? Under the system prevailing in Tasmania an inspector of a local board may also be employed as a rate collector or secretary of a road trust, and may, perhaps, exercise half-a-dozen other functions. Under the Federal control, however, new machinery would have to be created. We should require new machinery in order that the Act might be properly administered. The orchardists view with alarm the possibility, not only of a more rigid quarantine system, but of the passing of uniform regulations that may break down the barriers they have thought fit to create for the protection of their industry. The Government should be content to acquire general powers of oversea quarantine and quarantine as between State and State, leaving Intra-State matters to be dealt with for the time being by the local authorities. As an honorable member has said, the question is not so much one of legality as of expediency. I do not think any one would say that under this Bill the system of quarantine relating to the suppression of fruit pests should be more rigid than it is in toy electorate. I doubt if it could be more thorough, and in these circumstances, I ask whether it is wise for the Federal Government to seek to run counter to public opinion. I have never raised in this House the question of whether it is wise for the Federal Government to come into conflict with those of the States, and I am not dealing with this question from that stand-point. I feel that we often make a mistake in speaking of a State Government when we have really in mind the people who have elected us, and to whom we are responsible. This is a question between the Federal Parliament and the people who elect it. Unless we think that some great advantage will be secured by the Commonwealth Government clothing itself with these additional powers, I do not think that we should go out of our way to provide them, and thus create in the minds of our constituents a feeling hostile to the Parliament. On Saturday last, I addressed a very large meeting at Glenorchy, near Hobart, which was attended by representatives of all the fruit-growing districts. The unanimous request made by that meeting was that the local bodies should be left to deal with all local questions relating to the introduction of fruit pests. I hope that the Government will see their way clear to accede to that demand. If they would agree to eliminate from the Bill the clauses relating to plants and insect pests affecting plants, I believe that the remaining clauses would be passed through Committee in a quarter of an hour. I told the Acting Prime Minister on Friday, that I did not think there would be much objection to the Bill if he would agree to such an amendment. I do not believe that the Federal Government require this additional power, nor do I think that if they secured it they would exercise it as effectively as the States are now doing. If it is not the intention of the Commonwealth Government to carry out what I may call the police duties necessary for the proper exercise of the powers conferred by the Bill, I fail to see what will be gained by passing the measure. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. They certainly have not been subjected to any outside influence. They realize that this Parliament is being asked to do what the State Parliament was asked to do. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon obtained for the Tasmanian Government certain powers in connexion with these matters ; but it has since been found necessary to hand them to local authorities, who exercise them well. If pressure cannot be brought to bear on a State Government to compel persons possessing a few fruit trees to keep them clean, pressure could not be brought to bear on the Commonwealth Government to do so. The provisions of this measure, if it be agreed to as it stands, must be administered largely through the Customs Department, as the provisions of the Commerce Act are. But the abilities and experience which make the Customs officials excellent men for their present work, are very different from those required to be shown in the carrying out of a measure such as this. There can be no question of party in connexion with this measure. The Committee has considered it from the practical stand-point. I urge that growers can deal with pests better than a central authority can, and if Ministers will not agree to meet us, I shall support such amendments as will effect my object. I hope that they will agree to remove fruit and plant pests from the operation of the measure. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened attentively to the debate, and think that the honorable member for Bendigo gave us a splendid speech last night, although 1 regret that he referred to the State management of quarantine, and suggested that the authorities of Queensland and Victoria have not always done their duty in this matter. Whatever law or regulation may be in force, there will always be the possibility of faulty administration, because mistakes are always liable to occur in any matter under human control. The Constitution empowers this Parliament to pass laws in respect to quarantine, and we should be prepared . to exercise that power. Not only is it necessary to pass laws for the prevention of the spread of disease communicable by animals and human beings, it is also necessary to prevent the communication of disease by plant life and goods. Twenty years ago, when small-pox first broke out at Launceston, the infection was believed to come from clothes which had been taken from a lodging-house, and put into a store for twelve months, because it was the man who unpacked them who was first smitten with the disease. An instance like that shows that measures for the prevention of, disease cannot be effective unless they relate to goods as well as to animals and human beings. It has been said that the authorities of the States can administer health and quarantine laws better than they could be administered by the authorities of the Commonwealth. That argument has been used by the present Opposition in regard to all sorts of proposals ; but when the members of the Opposition party were supporting a Ministry, they took an opposite view. Whatever outsiders may say, it is not for us to declare ourselves incapable of managing the affairs of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- If the Government of Tasmania has found it better to give the administration of certain legislation to boards, what should prevent the Commonwealth from doing the same thing? I am altogether opposed to the amendment suggested by the honorable member for Brisbane. Steps for preventing the spread of disease must be taken immediately. If his amendment were agreed to, the Commonwealth would have to wait until a State had refused or neglected to take action. If small-pox were reported to have broken out at Mildura how long would the Commonwealth be expected to wait before taking action a day, a week, or a month ? I should be very sorry to see a clog put on the wheel of Commonwealth action in the manner proposed, and would rather leave the whole responsibility to the States. If the amendment were carried, the States would excuse themselves by saying, " We did not take action because we expected that the Commonwealth would do so.'"' Wherever there are two authorities, there is confusion, and maladministration. The arguments of some honorable members, if pushed to their logical conclusion, would prove Federation to be a mistake. Is it not a fact that the Federal Parliament has been able to provide for the effective management and administration of the Postal Department? </para>

                        <para>- This Parliament represents' the united wisdom of Australia, and if we are able to provide for the proper administration of the Postal Department, we can provide for the proper protection of «.the public health. I am not in favour of any of the amendments which have been suggested, because I think that the greater the powers of the Commonwealth for the protection of the public health the better. I hope that the Bill will pass as it is printed. Some years ago, when smallpox broke out in Launceston, the people of Hobart isolated the 20,000 inhabitants of that city, putting up barriers on every road, and even preventing the bakers' carts from going to the quarantine station to take bread there. There was a panic' in the southern city, and its citizens wished to injure those of Launceston. That is shown by the fact that, although there has been plague in Sydney on several occasions since, the Hobart people never tried to prevent vessels from coming from that port to Hobart. In a small community, one section will take action to injure another ; but under wider control such petty jealousy cannot have effect. I therefore hope the Bill will pass as printed, and that much good will be accomplished by its means. There has been too much diversity of opinion in the past as to what is proper quarantine. For instance, in Tasmania it was for years impossible to import a beast from Victoria unless it remained six months in quarantine, and cattle sent from Victoria to agricultural shows on the mainland could not return to their own pastures before undergoing a similar quarantine. By Federation we have adopted n. system of InterState free-trade, and, therefore, the. 'Commonwealth should have full control of all quarantine matters, because many of the restrictions placed on movements of cattle and goods between State and State have simply meant protection. It is time that we removed the numerous borders and boundary lines which are at present recognised, and secured a wider and purer Federation. t Personally, I was in favour of 'complete unification of the whole of Australia, and I have seen no reason to alter my opinion. </para>

                    <para>-- The honorable member for Bass, and others who have spoken, seem to have a remarkable faith in the benefits likely to result from Commonwealth administration. Such a faith is simply touching, in view of our experience of some Commonwealth Departments. The Honorable member for Bass asks why we have federated if not to create centralization and uniformity ; and he contends that the combined wisdom of all Australia must, of course, be greater than that of any small locality. Quite so; but that same argument could be applied to the question of how the roads in Launceston should be metalled. Nobody will deny, however, that the metalling of the roads is a matter that can' be much better decided by the people of the town. Some quarantine administration deals with matters of purely local concern. Why, then, bring to bear the whole machinery of the Commonwealth ? Why use a steam hammer to crack a nut? The only persons who are affected by, or have any interest in-, the spread of plant diseases from one State to another are those engaged in growing plants: the general community take an interest only in so far as they recognise that such diseases, damage the industries of the orchardists and others. Fruit-growing districts are widely separated, and have greatly varied local conditions ; and the people of the localities have, of their own accord, imposed- all kinds of restrictions in order to prevent the spread of disease. The objection to Federal administration is not a fear that the latter will impose greater restrictions, but that it will not impose sufficient restrictions. It has been contended that the Commonwealth is more likely to act than the States ; but the contrary is the case. The small local bodies might be induced to act, when the huge machinery of the Commonwealth Government could not be moved. The bigger the machinery, and the more numerous the Departments, the less efficient administration there will be. </para>

                        <para>- But it is not necessary to have a portable steam-engine in order to draw a child's go-cart; and, in any case, I question whether the huge Commonwealth machine would be the more effective. The best plan is to give the big work to the big machine - to reserve the Commonwealth machinery for oversea quarantine and quarantine as between State and State. Under no conceivable circumstances could the Commonwealth devise any better administration than can be found locally at the present time. All that the Commonwealth could do would be to ask the local inspectors or officers for advice. If that advice were not acted upon the Commonwealth administration would be shown to be less efficient than the local administration, and if it were acted upon, Commonwealth interference would be shown to be unnecessary. Honorable members talk in the most airy fashion about the necessity of our taking the widest possible powers. What is the good of those wide powers unless the intention is to interfere in local administration? We have all the reserve powers we want in the Constitution now, and no Act of Parliament can give us more. The only results of Commonwealth interference would be to create difficulty and disturbance where there is now harmony. </para>

                        <para>- That is an important point. At present the whole responsibility is thrown on the people, who have to be constantly moving the States Governments in order to secure complete protection. If that responsibility be removed, there will grow a general feeling that everything is in the hands of the Federal body ; and the tendency of that, of course, will be to encourage rather than to restrict the spread of disease. I should like to hear some practicable proposal. The district which I represent is largely interested in fruit-growing, and when any proposals are made for an alteration in the conditions of the industry I want to see some improvement as a possible result. If I do not see that a proposed change will be followed by improvement, but, on the contrary, may possibly lead to harm, it is my duty to voice the opinions of my constituents. We are here as the representatives of local men. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, Australia first; but Australian prosperity is made up of the prosperity of the units. If the prosperity of any parts of Australia is injured by some Federal action, then, of course, Australia as a whole is injured. We have been told that the Commonwealth ought to take the widest possible powers, but ought not to exercise them. In my opinion it would be much better not to specify those powers in an Act of Parliament. I do not believe that it is possible for any statesman, however able, to devise regulations, especially in regard to diseases of plants and stock, so as to give the satisfaction that is now given by the administration of the local authorities. I intend to support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to emphasize the remarks of the honorable member for Boothby, and to point out that for the Federal Parliament to take power to interfere in internal State administration of quarantine, is not to make for efficiency. This is not a matter of Federal or anti-Federal spirit. I believe in the Federal Parliament taking over to the widest extent the powers which we can the more efficiently administer. I need not even mention oversea quarantine, because that, together with Inter-State quarantine, we all admit, should be under Federal administration as the more efficient. It is necessary to have some supreme power to prevent a State so administering its quarantine laws as to practically impose a prohibitive Tariff, as has been done in certain instances in the past. But in regard to internal and local matters I am satisfied - and I may inform honorable members that I have had considerable experience in regard to the quarantining of stock - that the States can administer regulations much more effectively than can any central authority. For that reason I intend to assist those who propose to restrict the exercise of the Federal authority to Inter-State and oversea quarantine. To my mind, it is purely a question of securing expediency and efficiency. I had a considerable experience of the tick trouble in Queensland, and in that connexion obtained a very good knowledge of how the stock quarantine regulations are administered. My experience of those regulations, even when they were administered from a centre like Brisbane, and affected a distant portion of Queensland, was bad enough. But the difficulties which were' then encountered would be intensified one  hundred-fold if an attempt were made to administer similar regulations from a remote centre like Melbourne. It is in the interests of the whole community that the administration of such regulations should be in the hands of some authority as near to the different centres as possible. For that reason, I shall support every attempt which is made to confine Federal action to Inter-State and oversea quarantine. I trust that honorable members will regard the matter from that stand-point. It is not an anti-Federal matter, but simply one of securing the greatest possible efficiency, and of engendering the least possible friction between the States and the Federal authority. </para>

                    <para>.- It is very necessary that we should clearly set out in this clause that "officer" means a duly qualified medical man where diseases affecting human life are in question, and. a duly qualified veterinary surgeon where diseases affecting animals are concerned. This is not a matter which should be dealt with by regulation. It is quite impossible for ordinary Customs officers to deal effectively either with diseases affecting human life or with diseases affecting animals. </para>

In Victoria, from time to time, the Stock Department has been under the control of men who were not qualified veterinary surgeons, and in many cases the work has been done in such a manner as to permit of diseases spreading. Mistakes have bee'n made which would not -have been made by properly qualified veterinary surgeons. </para>

                        <para>- That is correct, but such an examination does not qualify them to act as veterinary surgeons.  A  chemist has a considerable knowledge of therapeutics, and an even greater knowledge of pharmacy, yet the possession of that knowledge does not qualify him to act as a medical practitioner. Under this measure, an ordinary Customs officer may be a quarantine officer. </para>

My contention is that our object should be to insure that the services under this measure shall be so well carried out that the rest of the world, will be able to point to them as the most up-to-date and satisfactory in existence. We are proposing to take to ourselves large powers in this respect, and unless we see that they are properly carried out, we are sure to have a very serious bungle. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that the Bill does not provide that a quarantine officer shall be a properly qualified medical man will not prevent the transfer of these officers under the regulations. It will be possible for the Federal  Government to take over every officer who has been engaged in administering the quarantine laws of the States. On the other hand, if we inserted the provision which the honorable member has suggested, we should be able to engage only those who have undergone what is admittedly a long and very expensive course of training. In some parts of the Commonwealth, it would be impossible to obtain the services of such men, and we should have to obtain them from centres of population, and so incur considerable expense. Experience has shown that we have at our disposal the means of coping with any sudden outbreak of diseases and it is not advisable that we should cause a feeling of unrest and further irritation on the part of the States by attempting to build up a huge department of quarantine, which would undoubtedly be one of the most expensive under Federal control. </para>

                    <para>This is a misapprehension.  The Bill says nothing about the Customs staff, and the power to appoint quarantine officers covers all necessary appointments of the. different medical and other experts required for .the various purposes of the Bill.

                <para class="block">It will thus be seen that it is wrong to imagine that in connexion with the Federal control of quarantine the Customs officers will be employed more largely than they are under the existing State laws. As to the inspection of live-stock, I would remind the honorable member that in New South Wales stock inspectors have to pass an examination to qualify for appointment. They are not veterinary surgeons, but the Government of New South Wales considers that men so appointed are competent to deal with all ordinary questions relating to diseases of live-stock. If they did not they would not appoint them. </para>

                        <para>- They are not so far as stock is concerned. We have stock travelling from State to State. I can assure the honorable member that it is our intention to work in harmony with the States. It is possible, and perhaps probable, that although the Government propose to take the power to do certain things the States officers, if the States themselves desire it, may be allowed to continue to, and probably in a great many instances will, administer the quarantine law, although under the control of the Federation. In a great many cases there will be no disturbance. The position will be much the same as it is in connexion with the administration of the Commerce Act. We hear of no disturbance in connexion with that law. The machinery of the States is at present being used more particularly in so far as its application to internal matters is concerned, but the work is carried on under the control of the Commonwealth Government. </para>

                <para>SirWILLIAM LYNE.- I am not going to agree to a proposal that the appointment of veterinary surgeons as inspectors of stock shall be compulsory. Probably we shall have such men acting as stock inspectors if it is thought necessary to secure their services. The honorable member must not imagine that we desire the Federal system of quarantine to be less effective than is that of the States. Our object is to secure improvements. </para>

If this measure is not properly carried out it will be for the Parliament to take action. Is it not the duty of the Parliament to see that the Ministry carries out in a proper way the work intrusted to it? Surely honorable members have faith in themselves? Surely they have sufficient confidence in the Parliament ? </para>

If the appointment of a veterinary surgeon to act as inspector of stock at every port were made compulsory additional expense would be incurred, and I do not think any great improvement would be effected either on the sea-board or inland. Therefore the Government cannot accept such an amendment as has been suggested. </para>

                    <para>.- I am in accord with the views of the honorable member for Corangamite. The Bill defines a quarantine officer merely as a "quarantine officer appointed under this Act," and does not say that he shall be qualified to perform the duties of such a position. The Minister has no right to "bullock" the measure through in this way. He has told the Committee that the acceptance of an amendment such as that suggested would make the Act expensive to work; but it must be expensive to work if duly qualified officers are appointed to the various ports. This is an example of the way in which Bills dealing with technical matters are brought forward by men who do not understand their subject-matter. It should be provided that the men appointed to act as quarantine officers shall have a knowledge of the duties which they will be required to perform ; that is to say, that they shall be qualified medical men. The measure cannot be satisfactorily administered by the Customs authorities. We have an instance of the way in which the Customs, authorities fail to protect the public health in the answer given to the question which I asked this afternoon as to the number of persons suffering from pulmonary consumption excluded under the Immigration Restriction Acts. </para>

I object to the clause as it stands. It is right that those who administer the measure should have large powers ; but the omission to provide that quarantine officers shall be qualified medical men is due to a desire to avoid any reference to the establishment of an administrative staff, organization, and machinery, which must nevertheless be created.

The Act will not be properly administered if qualified men are not appointed. I should like to know from the Attorney-General whether the word "goods" covers "ballast." In the States difficulties have arisen because of a difference of opinion in regard to this matter. If ballast is not included in the word " goods," we may have material thrown on our' shores containing the germs of malaria or other diseases. </para>

                <para class="block">I understood the honorable member for Corangamite to suggest that an amendment should be made providing that duly qualified medical men and veterinary surgeons shall be appointed and located at such ports. The honorable member says that probably there will be only about seven of them. Vessels should not be detained unnecessarily, and therefore such appointments are requisite. When disease  is discovered at an inland place a duly qualified man can be sent to make an inspection, and to report. </para>

                        <para>- At the present time, if disease breaks out within a State, a medical man has to be sent by the authorities to investigate it, as, for instance, one has been sent from Sydney to report upon a case of alleged plague in the electorate of Cowper. The Minister says that he desires not to be embarrassed, and that in all probability duly qualified men will be appointed, because such men are already holding positions as medical officers at the chief ports of the Commonwealth. I do not agree with those who suggest that the definition of "officers" should be amended. The words " officer appointed under this Act " will allow a duly qualified medical man to be appointed. If the Minister gives us his assurance that such men will be appointed, I think that the Committee may be content to accept it. </para>

                        <para>- Not in this case. We are beginning to discover the difficulties which arise when an attempt is made to incorporate in one the provisions of what should be three or four separate measures. This is a Quarantine Bill, a Public Health Bill, a Commerce Bill, and a Stock Bill, all in one. There will be the greatest difficulty in administering such a comprehensive measure as this. Perhaps the honorable member for Corangamite had better confine himself to . " quarantine officer," whom he could very well strictly define as a medical officer, or a veterinary surgeon, or of whatever qualification he desires. It is ' quite clear, however, that there is a broad distinction drawn in the Bill between the two kinds of officers. As already suggested, we shall need an army of officers on the borders of the States. </para>

It is quite clear that two kinds of officers are contemplated in the Bill. There are the general officers, who may, or may not, be quarantine officers. </para>

I do not care how severe . the Acting Prime Minister makes the requirements at the ports, but there must be some elasticity in the administration of the Bill on the borders of the States; and that elasticity will be there, if the honorable member for Corangamite confines himself to a strict definition of " quarantine officer." Indeed, the honorable member might go so far as to indicate the duties of the officer, and so forth. </para>

                    <para>.- I think the Treasurer scarcely sees the intent with which the honorable member for Corangamite spoke. What the honorable member for Corangamite desires is that any officer appointed shall be a competent person. To that the Acting Prime Minister retorts that any Government would take care to appoint a competent person. Of course, if the present Government, with their careful administration, remained in office, no doubt nothing would go wrong ; but, unfortunately, in course of time, the Opposition may cross the floor, and, by inadvertence, an officer might be appointed who was not a competent person. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt that would be so, as soon as the incompetence was discovered; but that would be locking the stable door after the horse had departed. Under clause 87,. there is power to make regulations, and I think the difficulty could be got over if an addition to that clause were made to the effect that it be a direction to the Minister, when appointing an? officer, to appoint a reasonably qualifier! man. As the- honorable member for Parramatta has said, there are a number of officers throughout the Commonwealth who are neither veterinary surgeons nor qualified medical men, but who are quite fit and proper persons for the work of inspection. If anything serious occurs, they telegraph or send to the nearest authority, and an expert is sent to the spot. The Commonwealth desires to take this administration over as nearly as possible under existing conditions ; and I think that my suggestion "would remove any difficulty. While no Minister would wilfully appoint an incompetent person, still such a person might be appointed through inadvertence. . </para>

                    <para>.- We .appear to be straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel. In Victoria there are some really good stock inspectors, and I apprehend that such is the fact in the other States. We have <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris</inline> in charge of the Health Department of Victoria now ; and why not make him, and the corresponding official in each of the other States, the officer in charge. I understand from the Acting Prime Minister that there is no intention to incur fresh expenditure, and, moreover, that there will be no proclamation, perhaps, for some time, bringing the Act into force. My object is to save expenditure; and that, I think, could be attained by the acceptance of my suggestion. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I think that the whole or part of the services of any officer of a State can be obtained on terms to be arranged between the Public Service Commissioner and the representatives of the States. It would be a mistake to provide in advance that the services of a particular officer must be availed of ; and I question whether we have the power to do so. If the officer we require is a quarantine officer his services, doubtless, could be availed of, but, if he were not, then all our efforts are futile. </para>

When sent to inspect, they have known nothing about the disease; and' this goes to show that, without the services of a properly qualified veterinary surgeon, the inspection is a waste of money. </para>

                        <para>- Then I will say that the measure will not involve much additional expenditure, because very few fresh appointments will be necessary. But I wish to emphasize the contention that veterinary surgeons must be appointed at all the ports of entry in order that diseases which may be communicated inland, may be followed up by properly qualified men. The chief object of the Bill is to enable the Commonwealth to quarantine certain areas within the States - not to undertake the administrative actions which are now performed by the States. The desire is that the Federation shall be able to quarantine certain areas in case of an epidemic occurring within the boundaries of any State. That being the case, we require the services of duly qualified men, who will be competent to report upon those epidemics. Probably for some time to come it will not be necessary to appoint more than a few additional officers, but it is imperative that they shall be duly qualified men, seeing that their duties will not only involve the quarantining of specified areas, but service in a professional capacity at the ports of entry. In other words, they will require to be possessed of the qualifications necessary to fit them to undertake the general administration of the law of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that the honorable member for Corangamite has proposed that provision should be made in this clause for the appointment of medical officers to investigate diseases affecting human life, and of veterinary surgeons to report upon diseases of animals. I think that his proposal would add greatly to the expense of administering the Act, and, personally, I do not see any necessity for it. I cannot conceive that in a well-equipped Quarantine Department such as I hope will be established in every State, there will not be one expert medical officer and one veterinary surgeon whose services will be available whenrequired. </para>

                        <para>- Switzerland has not a navy, and therefore does not afford an example similar to that which I am about to give. The United States Government does not depend entirely upon its health officers, although it has perhaps one of the finest staffs of health officers in the world stationed at the Philippines. But it makes every port in Australia provide a bill of health <inline font-style="italic">vised</inline> by the American Consul. Unless these bills of health are <inline font-style="italic">vised</inline> by the consuls, and unless they set out the number of certain diseases which have occurred during the previous month or six weeks, no ship concerned is allowed to enter port without first undergoing a period of quarantine. The same regulation is adopted in regard to ships coming from China and Japan. Perhaps honorable members will wonder why ships are so anxious to visit the Philippines, but as a matter of fact, the sum of <inline font-style="italic">£100</inline> is given to every vessel that will visit a certain port there. I shall support the Government, because I feel sure that the head of the Quarantine Department will never send an officer to report upon any outbreak of disease who is not qualified to express an opinion upon it. </para>

The honorable member for Corangamite probably knows that when professional  men have had control, diseases have been planted in innocent people, which would not have been so planted had the laity had control. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Colonel FOXTON</inline>(Brisbane) [6.10].- I wish to call attention to another point connected with this clause. I desire to know the real meaning of the term " quarantinable disease"? The clause defines it thus -  " Quarantinable disease " means small-pox, plague, cholera, yellow fever, typhus fever, or leprosy, or any disease declared by the Governor- General, by proclamation, to be a quarantinable disease. </para>
                <para>The word "disease" is defined in two places as follows: -  " Disease " in relation to animals, means glanders, farcy, pleuro-pneumonia contagiosa, foot and mouth disease, rinderpest, anthrax, Texas or tick fever, hog cholera, swine plague, mange, scab, surra,  dourine,  rabies, tuberculosis, actinomycosis, variola  ovina,  or any disease declared by the Governor-General by proclamation to be a disease affecting animals ; " Disease " in relation to plants, means any disease or pest declared by the Governor-General by proclamation to be a disease affecting plants. </para>
                <para>I have shown that under the head of  quarantinable disease " is included any disease declared by the Governor-General to be a " quarantinable disease." It is very necessary to have a clear understanding as to the meaning of this term, because it occurs in so many portions of the Bill, notably in clauses 17 and 18. If my reading of the measure be correct, the goods referred to in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of sub-clause 2 of clause 18, would require to be infected with some disease which would be <inline font-style="italic">ejusdem generis</inline> with those which are specifically mentioned under the head,ing of "quarantinable disease." I think it is desirable that I should call attention to this matter. </para>

                    <para>.- In advocating the appointment of medical officers to investigate and report upon diseases under this Bill, I am supported by the very highest authorities. I have no desire to increase the expenditure which will be incurred under the measure beyond that which is absolutely necessary. At the same time, I wish to make the Bill a thoroughly efficient  One.  That result can only be assured by insisting that at every port of entry into the Commonwealth there shall be a duly qualified medical man to investigate diseases affecting human life, and a qualified veterinary surgeon to deal with diseases affecting animal life. At present these matters are dealt with bv the States. Under the Bill they will still be administered by the State officials, because I apprehend that the officers at present charged with their administration will act in this regard, as Federal officers. But if any State has hitherto neglected to employ the services of a properly qualified officer  in  this connexion, the Government should see that such an officer is appointed. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to assert that no man can become a properly qualified medical officer unless he has gone through a course of training extending over five years, and has passed all the prescribed examinations. Such men alone are fit to administer the provisions of an Act relating to the preservation of human life. I repeat also that we should have veterinary surgeons to act as inspectors of stock. The honorable member for Laanecoorie, who  supported the statement that stock inspectors were qualified to deal with the inspection of animals under this measure might just as well say that a chemist who has been making up prescriptions four or five years should be allowed to practice as a medical man. If we desire to make this measure effective, we must have properly qualified medical officers at certain ports, and I therefore move - </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. The Minister would have power to appoint Customs officers as quarantine officers at different points, and these, under my proposal, would have to report to medical men acting as health officers ; to veterinary surgeons acting as inspectors of live stock, and to entomologists appointed to deal with the introduction of plant life. Under the Bill, the Minister has power to declare certain ports of entry for animals and plants. </para>

                        <para>- After his original proposition had been discussed at great length, the honorable member came forward with an amendment which gave it an entirely different complexion. I should like to say at this stage that he has attributed to me two statements which I did not make. He said, in the first place, that I had declared that stock inspectors under the States laws were better qualified than veterinary surgeons to administer this measure. I did not do so. By way of interjection, when the honorable member for Parramatta was speaking, I said that some stock inspectors were better qualified than veterinary surgeons for dealing with diseases in stock. I repeat that assertion. I know of stock inspectors who are more capable than are very many properly qualified men to deal with some of the diseases peculiar to stock - diseases which some qualified men have never had an opportunity to see. </para>

                        <para>- No. I am referring to men who have availed themselves of exceptional opportunities to deal with diseases peculiar to live stock. The honorable member also attributed to me a statement that all stock inspectors had to pass an examination. I made no such assertion. I simply inquired whether stock inspectors in Victoria had to pass an examination, and learned, much to my astonishment, that they had not. As to the amendment moved by the honorable member, I think that, like another that has been proposed, it is immaterial whether it be accepted or rejected. Under the clause as it stands, the Minister will have power to appoint specially qualified men as quarantine officers, and I am sure that he will do so where practicable. In the circumstances, therefore, I do not think that the amendment should be pressed. It would .not be mandatory j it would not compel the Minister to do that which the honorable member desires. Even if it were agreed to there would still be power to appoint as a quarantine officer either a qualified medical man or any other person. </para>

                    <para>.- While I sympathize with the desire of the honorable .member for Corangamite that at all declared ports of entry qualified medical practitioners shall be appointed to examine passengers who desire to land, with a view to ascertaining whether they should be quarantined, I do not think that his amendment should be made at this stage, though I regard it as another evidence of the fact that the Bill has not been well drafted that such a provision is not already contained in it. Throughout the measure, the officers who will be called upon to administer it are grouped together. But the word " officers " means more than the officers who will be called upon to do the work of inspection to which I refer. Whether it is, or is not, needful to incorporate in the measure a direction to the Government that only duly qualified medical practitioners shall be appointed to examine ships' passengers and crews, I do not think it necessary to provide for the appointment of stock inspectors at ports of entry to visit ships. All stock imported into Australia under this measure will, I take it, be landed under practically the same conditions which now apply to the landing of stock under State Acts. Bitter experience has taught the authorities of the States that diseases of stock can be excluded only by detaining for observation, for long periods, all imported stock. That being so, the appointment of veterinary surgeons as stock inspectors to board ships at the port of entry should not be necessary. But the impression has got abroad that the ports of entry for stock will not include all the capitals of Australia. I hope that that will not be so. As I read the measure, the Government is empowered to declare certain ports to be ports of entry for animals, and I urge upon the Minister the advisability of proclaiming as " declared ports " those which are now recognised by the authorities of the States as ports at which stock can be landed and quarantined. Imported stock is usually stud stock of great value, whose owners desire to inspect it from time to time, to see how it is getting on ; and a Ministerial statement as to the policy of the Government in this regard would go a long way towards removing what I believe to be a misapprehension as to what is intended. </para>

                    <para>.- With regard to what has bee said as to ports of entry, I would remind the Minister that health officers sometimes direct that the passengers and crew of a vessel shall, for the purpose of being quarantined, proceed to another port than that first entered. For instance, at Newcastle, there might not be sufficient quarantine accommodation for the passengers and crew of an infected vessel, and the ship might be ordered to proceed to Sydney. But difficulty would arise if her charter party provided that she must call at the port of Newcastle, and no other, or if her policy of insurance contained a similar provision. </para>

                <para class="block">Clause 50 provides that no person shall land imported animals or plants at any port or place in Australia except a port declared by proclamation to be a port where imported animals or plants may be landed. The Bill creates ports of entry which are to be proclaimed subsequently. It will be at these ports only that imported animals and plants may be landed, and it will be necessary to have at each such port a man specially trained fpr the detection of diseases in animals. All that the Minister will have to do will be to reappoint State officials who are already acting, or, if they are not properly qualified, other men possessing the necessary qualifications. Unless these appointments are made, the Bill will not be as effective as are the Acts of the States. At the present time, there is at every port of entry in the Commonwealth a legally qualified medical practitioner who acts as Health Officer, and I go only a little further in proposing that a legally qualified veterinary surgeon shall also be appointed for each port of entry for animals. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member believes that the old-fashioned cow doctor is good enough for the treatment of animals. No doubt he thinks that a man who has served an apprenticeship to a chemist, and has sold a few pills and cough lozenges, is capable of carrying out the duties of a legally qualified medical man. That is a low view to take of the profession. I hope that the honorable member is in a very considerable minority in the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry to hear the Minister, who is likely to be responsible for the administration of the Bill, suggesting  that unqualified men should be employed in relation to the diseases of animals or human beings ; and his utterance only emphasizes the necessity for the amendment. An honorable member has. pointed out to me that all small municipal councils insist on having legally qualified men as medical officers of health. The amendment provides nothing more than a direction to the Minister to do what in nine cases out of ten he would do ; and the only object is to see that the Act is efficiently administered. </para>

The whole of the administration as now carried on may, under clause 11, be taken over by the Commonwealth, and we have the Minister's assurance as to the employment of qualified men. </para>

                    <para>.- On paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> I propose to raise the question of whether or not plants should be subjected to a general quarantine or merely to a limited quarantine. I had given notice of an amendment, which, if carried, would have had the effect of exempting goods as well as plants from general quarantine, but after hearing the arguments advanced last evening by members of the medical profession, particularly by the honorable member for Laanecoorie and the honorable member for. Corangamite, I decided not to press that portion of my proposal, because I can easily conceive that it might be just as necessary for the Federal quarantine authorities to pursue goods the property of passengers as to pursue the passengers themselves. The personal effects of a passenger might contain quarantinable diseases, and therefore they ought to be subjected to the general control of the Federal authorities. For . this reason, I intend to confine my amendment to the exemption of plants from general quarantine, and accordingly I move- </para>

Full control is thus given to the Federal authority in matters of quarantine over persons or animals on land as well as on sea. The amendment, if accepted, will limit the quarantine of plants to the first port of landing. If the Federal authorities certify that plants are clean, the latter will be free to proceed to their destination, and will remain finally and completely under the control of the State authorities. </para>

In addition, I think that there is not the same demand for Federal intervention in the case of plants that exists in reference to persons and animals. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. All Vegetation Diseases Acts declare that plants include fruit. However, it is undesirable to enter into too many definitions in this portion of the Bill. With reference to plants and vegetation products, I would point out that at the present time the laws of the various States are very complete and scientific. They are also very effective in their operation. I do not think there is any State in the world where the Government have a more scientific and up-to-date system of inspection and regulation of vegetation diseases than obtains in Victoria. A similar scientific and up-to-date system exists in Tasmania, South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland. In fact, all the States are up-to-date in their legislative efforts to suppress these diseases, and I believe that of late they have been fairly successful. Of course, it may be that in years gone by they were not so enterprising and so prompt as they are now. But all of them have established active, vigorous Departments of Agriculture, and I think they may fairly be intrusted with the administration of these laws, and with the task of developing, improving, and supervising means of controlling anything in the nature of local outbreaks in plant and vegetable life. In regard to plant life, the difference in climatic conditions and latitude has necessarily involved a variety in the legal system. There is not a legal uniform system for the .regulation and suppression of vegetation diseases, such as obtains in regard to animal life. But in each of the States there is a well-organized 'Department, backed up by a good legislative system for this purpose, so that there is no cause for the intervention of the Federal authority, in matters of internal supervision in regard to plants and vegetable life. </para>

                        <para>- There might. But in the meantime, carrying out the principle which I affirmed last night, I shall not be a party to interfering with State functions without good cause. I think that honorable members may be once more reminded of the dictum of Chief Justice Marshall in reference to quarantine matters. He said that every effort should be made to secure harmony and conciliation between the Federal and State authorities, and that the former should not, without reasonable cause, interfere in matters which were local and provincial as distinguished from matters which were of national or general concern. I believe also that there is a feeling of uneasiness amongst some of the States that the power of quarantine embodied in this Bill, if applied to orchards and vegetable plantations, might be made an instrument to harass, if not to oppress, our orchardists. They fear that orchards may be unnecessarily quarantined, and that the recommendations of the local officers may be disregarded by the Federal authorities, who may not understand the local requirements of the industry. Consequently, I think, first upon the ground that no strong case has been made out for the inclusion of plants, and, secondly, because in this matter we may fairly make a concession to State susceptibilities, that the Committee, without any surrender of power or anything savouring of self-, abnegation or of an abandonment of trust, may fairly leave plant life to the supervision and' protection of the State authorities when once it has run the gauntlet of Federal inspection at the port of entry. This would still give the Federal Government unqualified powers of supervision and inspection up to a certain point, leaving the subsequent movements of the plants under the control of the States authorities. </para>

It would be a pity to. interfere with the uniform administration of the Bill by providing that the control of the States over the introduction of fruit pests by land shall be retained, but shall be abandoned in respect of the possible introduction of those pests by sea. Such pests might be introduced by sea, not from parts beyond the Commonwealth, but from one part of Australia to another. That, at all events, is my reading of the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- In some of the States Acts there is power to declare places beyond the sea as infected places for the purpose of putting into force the fruit pest laws against importations from such countries. We have not taken that power under this Bill. Under- clause 12, to which we have just agreed, the power of the Governor-General by proclamation to declare places beyond the sea infected with a quarantinable disease does not apply to plants. If I am not mistaken, however, under the South Australian Act of 188=;, such a power exists. It would be rather dangerous to confine the operation of the States laws to the introduction of disease by land from State to State. We have really abrogated, part of the power to deal with imports from abroad, which is given by the States Acts, and have not put in this Bill sufficient provision to take its place. In this way great danger might arise. If we agree, as proposed by the honorable member for Bendigo, to confine the operation of the States Acts to the introduction of disease from State to State, then we surely ought to take as ample powers under this Bill as exists under the States Acts to prevent the introduction of plant or fruit pests by imports from oversea. If we do take over the power of controlling the introduction of plant pests from oversea, we ought to be as thorough as are the States. The South Australian Act of 1885, to which I have referred, does not deal with quarantine, but with the introduction of fruit pests, and it is a very ample and exhaustive measure. I hope that in the circumstances we shall hesitate before we split up between the States and the Federation powers in relation to' the introduction of plant and fruit diseases. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so.. The clause provides that there shall be a general power of proclamation, and this will not be affected by the amendment fore-: shadowed by the Treasurer. There will be a general power to put in force all the subclauses of clause 13, and we do not know what the proclamations will substitute for the State laws. I think that we should exercise a little caution before we -decide to vote for the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the honorable member for Bendigo will accept the proposal foreshadowed by the Minister, since it will go even further than he proposes. I join with the honorable member in expressing the hope that we shall ' do everything possible to maintain friendly (relations between the Commonwealth and the States. The honorable member for Brisbane is entitled to our thanks for having brought this matter so prominently before us. By limiting the power of the Commonwealth, we might seriously cripple  out  capacity to make what might be in the future a desirable effort. We must realize that the States, acting as they undoubtedly do at certain times in antagonism to each other, will look to the Federal authority as a sort of arbiter, and will be verv glad indeed to see the Minister who is administering this measure taking steps to prevent that irritation which in the past has been so disastrous to the States concerned. The effect of the amendment moved bv the honorable member for Bendigo would be to seriously limit the authority of the Federal Government, and it might operate in a way contrary to that which he desires. Many people are engaged in the fruit-growing industry in Australia, and are watching very carefully all importations of fruit and plants, not only from abroad, but from one State into another. We know that from time to time they move their States Governments to pass regulations, which, in the main, are intended undoubtedly for the protection and preservation of their orchards, but which, in some cases, the unbiased observer must admit, have tended to prohibit the introduction of the products of orchards from other States. That is a procedure which the Federal authority could not possibly countenance. We desire that trade and commerce between the States shall be unhampered. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo is a good one. As I said, this afternoon, when speaking 00* another clause, I think that it will be well to exclude plants from the scope of the Bill, except so far as their importation from oversea is concerned. Except in regard to foreign importations, the authorities of the States, may well be allowed to make such laws as they think necessary for the prevention of the spread of diseases affecting vegetation. None of the States has asked that the Commonwealth shall take power to deal with diseases of plants, except so far as their importation from abroad is concerned. The States are now doing all that can be done for the prevention of the spread within Australia of diseases affecting vegetation. The fact that one State may unreasonably restrict the importation of fruit from another does not touch the issue. Take the case of Western Australia, for instance. </para>

                        <para>- If plants are excluded from the operation of the Bill, the local authorities of a State will be quite able to protect their people, as they do now, from plant and vegetable diseases likely to come from another State.. It is not a wise course to pass legislation that is not needed. If the measure proves to be a good one, as I think it will should plants be excluded from its scope, the States may some day ask the Commonwealth to assume control of vegetation diseases. Until then, and under present circumstances, it is not wise to apply this legislation to plants. </para>

Like other members of the Committee, I desire that the Commonwealth shall not interfere unnecessarily or unduly with the authorities of the States, and, furthermore, I wish to put an end to that undue and improper interference by one State with the trade of another, which, if it has not yet extended far, is beginning to operate under the regulations which have been made, not altogether for the exclusion of disease, but for the exclusion of goods. Holding these views, I welcome the amendment foreshadowed by the Minister, for which credit must be given to the honorable member for Brisbane. It will prevent interference with the States by the Commonwealth, unless they grossly neglect their duty to other States in allowing diseases to spread unchecked within their territories. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid that they have sometimes done so in the past ; but, with the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, I think that, they are now more particular. So long as their officers are properly enforcing satisfactory regulations for the prevention of the spread of disease, I hope that no proclamation will be issued to interfere with the actions of State authorities within their own territory. But in connexion with the provision that the Minister may appoint places on land or sea to be quarantine stations for the purpose of quarantine of vessels, persons, goods, animals, or plants, I ask him whether he has considered the financial aspect of the proposal. One of the reasons for transferring the control of quarantine to the Commonwealth is that economy may thereby be effected, and the  inconvenience to owners of vessels and passengers visiting Australia minimized. The quarantine stations of the States are very valuable properties. Is it the intention of the Minister that the Commonwealth shall take them over as they are, or does he recognise that, as most of the vessels coming here -will be dealt with at Fremantle on the west, and at Thursday Island on the north, the quarantine stations at Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, necessary to deal with vessels coming direct to those ports, will not need to be as extensive as are the present stations? </para>

                        <para>- The rent would, of course, be proportionate to the value of the land taken, but to effect the economy anticipated, much more would fee necessary. It will have to be determined whether the large properties now used by some of the States for quarantine purposes will be necessary .under Commonwealth control, and whether smaller and cheaper properties will not be sufficient. These financial aspects should receive some attention, especially as we are undertaking liabilities, of the amount of which we are not yet aware. For instance, there may be destruction of crops, the rendering of land idle for years, as with phylloxera, or the destruction of animals - all these responsibilities will fall on the Commonwealth. We are now complaining that, in a short time, the revenue will be hardly equal to our requirements, and, therefore, the financial phase of the question should be dealt with. In some places there are verv large properties - properties which will be quite unnecessarily large under the new <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> if the administration be altered in the way I- have indicated - and this point, top, should receive consideration, so that when the Commonwealth takes over the departments, we shall not be- committed to an expenditure which will be found to show no saving on the present outlay. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline>H. IRVINE (Flinders) [9.2I.- The honorable member for North Sydney has drawn attention to two very important matters, one of which is connected with the Bill at present under discussion, and especially with the clause before us. There is  a tendency which seems to be growing, I regret to say, amongst the States, sometimes with a perfectly <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> desire to prevent the influx of diseases of animals and plants, to erect barricades against the other States - a tendency which may lead to considerable retaliation if unduly pressed. The other important matter is the financial or business aspect of the whole of these quarantine' proposals. I should like to say a few words on each of these points. There is a little misapprehension, if I mav say so, in the mind of the honorable member for North Sydney as to what  we are actually doing in regard to the first. I. am not going to ask honorable members to listen to the constitutional argument. The views which I have on that important' question I gave utterance to on the second reading of the measure. I pointed out then that I thought we were going far beyond our constitutional powers in entering into the internal affairs of the States. But whatever we may conceive to be the meaning of the word " quarantine," as used in section 51 of the Constitution, it is quite clear what " quarantine " means in section 69 of the Constitution. The latter is the section which deals with the transfer of certain States Departments to the Commonwealth. It is there provided that the Postal Department, the Defence Department, and the Quarantine Department are to be transferred, and, however wide a meaning the word may have in the general grant of legislative power in section 51. I do not think honorable members will contend there is much difficulty in knowing what the Quarantine Departments of the various States were at the time the Constitution came into force. Every one will admit that these Departments were the Departments ordinarily known as those dealing with the introduction of disease from oversea along our coasts. I do not think there can be any dispute about that ; I feel certain the Courts would have no difficulty in coming to a conclusion. It may be possibly consistent with this, that the word " quarantine," as used  in the grant of legislative power, may have a much wider signification - I do not think it has, but it may have. That, however, does not touch the question that the Departments taken over mean the quarantine grounds, the officers - the property in connexion with this very important function of Government administered by the various States in preventing the influx of disease in human beings, and possibly also animals, from oversea. Our legislation in regard to every Department we take over is exclusive of the legislation of the States. So far, therefore, as concerns the quarantining of persons and animals from abroad at the sea-board, any legislation we pass wipes out or supersedes the legislation of the States, and there can be no conflict. The legislation of the State and Commonwealth is not concurrent or cumulative, but one takes the place of the other ; and that is all right. But when we come to deal with particular Statutes concerning the control of the movements of stock or of plants, or of anything of that kind, as between different parts of the Commonwealth, we are not making laws - we may be making laws, though I do not think we are - which come under the general term of quarantine, and we are certainly not making laws in regard to the quarantine Departments of the States which we have taken over. If that be so, our legislation is not in any way exclusive. It is purely cumulative, or an addition to the legislation passed by the States. </para>

                    <para>- The object has, of course, to be considered in all cases. I shall take an example to illustrate what I mean. It may be highly desirable - in fact, I. think it is, in many respects - that there should be a central authority controlling the general movements of diseased stock. There are many arguments in favour of that view, and I am not going to ask the House to reverse the decision come to a little while ago. I am endeavouring to show that, if we pass legislation controlling the movements of stock as between the States, or as between different parts of the Commonwealth, we are not creating legislation that affects in any degree the existing legislation, or the existing power to legislate, of the various States. That is the point I desire to impress. </para>

                        <para>- On the definition of " Quarantine Departments." In Victoria, there is a Dairy Supervision Act, for example, in which it is provided that certain diseases are to be isolated, and that the isolation of the herds shall be done under the order of inspectors, who work under the administration of the Minister of Agriculture. I am sure that honorable members will not think that it ever was the intention of the Constitution that, in taking over the Quarantine Department of Victoria, the Commonwealth should take over that portion of the Minister of Agriculture's Department, with all its officers and machinery concerned with the isolation of diseased stock. </para>

                        <para>- I shall give another illustration. In Queensland, a there isa very important Act called the Stock Diseases Act, under which a Board of Commissioners is appointed, and which has proved a very effective measure. The Commissioners have the power to appoint inspectors, and also to impose taxation in proportion to the number of the stock ; and they may create a statutory fund for the purpose of dealing with the local conditions of stock. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely giving this as an instance. This Board of Commissioners exercise - and I think most effectually - most important internal functions in the State of Queensland. But who would ever have thought that when the Constitution provided that the Quarantine Department of Queensland should be transferred to the Commonwealth, it was intended that there should be transferred this Board, the officers, inspectors, and the funds and property of the Board - the various areas in Queensland in, which the work of isolation is carried on - as part of the Quarantine Department of Queensland? I do not suppose that any one for a moment thought that to be the intention. I might multiply instances indefinitely, but I think these two will serve. What I desire to point out is that, so far as the Quarantine Departments are concerned, we cannot read the Constitution as meaning that the Federal Government were to take over - were bound to take over such matters as those to which I have referred. The only matter is to fix the date- </para>

                        <para>- There may be negotiations, as in the case of the other transferred Departments, in regard to exchanging properties and so on, while officers in the Quarantine Departments may also perform other functions- all that is a matter of arrangement. What ' I desire to urge is that this important point, first mooted by the honorable member for North Sydney, certainly deserves the careful attention of the Government. If we extend this Bill to deal with the movements of stock from one place in Australia to another - whether from one State to another does not matter in this connexion - all the machinery we create, and the legislation we pass, is cumulative on that of the States,  and it will not1 interfere in the slightest degree with the danger to which the hon- 1orable member for North Sydney referred. For instance, Victoria has legislation or administrative regulations' against the introduction of the fruit fly. That may be right or wrong, but assume it to be as wrong as possible, and its motive to be far beyond what is reasonably necessary for the protection of the fruit-growers - there is no power we can take under this Bill, or no power we could take in any shape, that could give us any control ; and that must be remembered. The Constitution itself provides the only control ; it provides that trade and commerce as between the various States shall be absolutely free. It is perfectly consistent with this, as held in hundreds of cases in America, that each State, being a separate entity, is entitled to preserve its individual existence, and for that purpose to preserve the health of' its people, and 'to use certain police powers, certain inspection laws, and certain powers of restriction in regard to the importation of diseased animals or people from abroad. A State has the power to make such provisions as are reasonably necessary for the purposes of protection, and to that extent to interfere with the freedom of . commerce, but to that extent only. </para>

All that it purports to do is to enable us to establish a quarantine, and to control the movements of stock, &amp;c, as between the  various parts of the Commonwealth.

If we passed a. law which was inconsistent with a State law/ our law would prevail, so long as we had power to enact it. But in regard to this clause, we say that we are not going to touch what ' Victoria is doing in reference to the fruit fly, and that we do not intend to interfere with what she is doing in the way of prohibiting the introduction of similar pests.

                        <para>- Certainly, assuming that the State regulations were such as it had power to make under the Constitution, and were not unreasonable for the purpose of protecting its own people or stock, our regulations would not be inconsistent with the State regulations in the slightest degree, and would therefore not override them. The two sets of regulations would exist side by side. It is possible that under the name of a Quarantine Bill we might pass a law regulating, or possibly prohibiting the action of the States in regard to some of these matters ; but we are. not attempting to do that. </para>

                        <para>- If all the machinery and property belonging to the various internal departments for regulating diseases of fruit, diseases in cattle, and providing for dairy supervision, are taken over under this Bill, as part of the transferred Department, we shall have to pay for them. If they are not taken over - as I submit they should not be - then all that we can do is to provide other properties of our own for the purpose of administering the Act, and that would have the effect of duplicating existing services which are performing these functions. I am glad to learn that the Acting Prime Minister has an amendment which he says will meet the difficulty. In conclusion, I merely desire to say that I  fear we are getting into rather deep water in connexion with this Bill. I am a very strong federalist. The honorable member for Bendigo declared the other evening that he was a federalist, and desired to extend the powers of this Parliament. So am I. I am so strong a federalist that I desire, above all things, to keep within the limits of our Federal power. I will give one strong reason for my view. We should not purport to go beyond our power, because there are one or two great questions with which this House will shortly have to deal. I might instance especially the financial relations of the Commonwealth to the States. We have great, wide, and almost absolute powers in regard to that question, powers which I believe it is our duty and responsibility to exercise in order to effectually solve it. But if, in the meantime, in dealing with a lot of minor matters, we encroach in this direction and in that .upon the State preserves, if we irritate not merely the State authorities but also sections of people in the States, I fear that when we come to deal with the greater tasks with which we are faced, we shall find ourselves hampered - we shall find ourselves dealing with them under circumstances of irritation and difficulty that might have been avoided had we kept within proper bounds. At this stage I do not wish to interpose any difficulty whatever to the passing of the Bill, because the Committee earlier in the evening decided to adopt the wider scope and . ambit of this legislation. The Acting Prime Minister has stated that he will be able to introduce an amendment to correct some of these difficulties. I wish to cordially assist him in that way. </para>

                    <para>- Yes. If the definition of the honorable member for Flinders be the correct one - and he has fortified his argument by reference to State Acts- all that we are now doing o,it-side of providing for maritime quarantine is useless. Whilst he was addressing the Committee, the question occurred to me, " What was the intention underlying the taking over of quarantine arrangements at all ?" Clearly it does not mean a barren transference of power. There must have been some object in the provision for the taking over of quarantine. </para>

                        <para>- Everything depends upon the definition of " quarantine." It all resolves itself into the question of whether we have the extensive powers which it is proposed to take in this Bill. It occurs to me that that general observation ought to be considered in dealing with the question of our powers. What is the object of taking over quarantine at all ? What was the object of taking over the Defence Department? Clearly it was to obtain a better Defence Force. I am almost certain, however, that we have not got it. Indeed, I very much doubt if we have a more efficient Post Office than we had prior to Federation. It may be that we shall get a better Department under the control of the honorable member for Maribyrnong. Nevertheless, the main object in taking over these Departments was to amplify them. </para>

                        <para>- Why was the harmonizing to take place ? Clearly to make the power a more efficient one. Everything, I repeat, will ultimately depend upon the ruling of the High Court. If it rules that the narrow interpretation of quarantine suggested by the honorable member for Flinders must obtain - and I admit it will have many precedents for adopting that view - I do not know of any quarantine law covering so wide a field as we contemplate under this Bill. Assuming that we have the power - and the Committee has already decided that we shall proceed on that assumption - it occurs to me that the proposal foreshadowed by the Minister will cover far more ground than that contemplated by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo. I therefore do not think that he ought to press his amendment. A point that I should like to emphasize is that this seems to be only a Bill to fortify and reinforce the quarantine laws of the States. It does not propose to give relief from the stringency of those laws. Surely the measure is one which should operate in the direction of greater leniency as well as of greater stringency where necessary. I should be glad to hear what further proposals the Acting Prime Minister has to make; but I trust that the honorable and learned member for Bendigo will agree to waive his proposal in favour of that made by, the Minister. </para>

                    <para>. - There can be no doubt that this clause will involve "a great deal of expenditure. Under section 69 of the Constitution we have power to take over certain Departments, and as 1 contended in my speech on the motion for the second reading of this Bill, I think we are proceeding beyond our powers in providing that this Bill shall apply to other than oversea quarantine. Is it to be assumed that the framers of the Constitution, in passing section 69, and also the Braddon section, which makes the exercise of economy imperative, ever contemplated that we should take over the hundred and one services with which this measure deals? I repeat that these proposals will involve an enormous expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth, and I am satisfied that the contention of the honorable and learned member for Flinders is correct. I urged the Minister privately to confine the operation of the Bill to oversea quarantine, taking power to deal with quarantine in any of the States only when we find that effective action is not being taken by them. There has been a lengthy discussion on the meaning of the word " quarantine," as used in the Constitution, and I am strongly of opinion that the intention of the framers was that the Federal authority should exercise control only over oversea quarantine. I am fortified in that belief by the fact that such serious financial responsibilities are imposed upon the Commonwealth by the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member for Flinders has put in legal phraseology the view that I expressed before the adjournment for dinner. I then pointed out that we have in Tasmania local Boards, appointed under special Acts, and possessing enormous powers to insure the effective operation of laws relating to fruit pests. Those Boards have been created under special laws that have no bearing on quarantine, and I fail to see how it would be possible for the Commonwealth to deal with those bodies under a Quarantine Bill. If we have not the power to take them over, we must either sweep them away altogether or allow them to remain as at present. Under the Bill as it stands power is being taken to enable the Minister by proclamation to create quarantine areas. If a pest be found in an orchard the whole of the orchard may be quarantined. The Minister may quarantine a whole district, and bring ruin upon many orchardists. It is difficult to determine what will be the effect of the Bill when so many additions and emendations are being made, but so far as I have been able to gather from the information imperfectly put before us, I think that the amendment foreshadowed by the Minister will go a long way towards granting that which the honorable member for Bendigo, the honorable member for Brisbane, and I, as well as others, have been endeavouring to secure. I would suggest that we should agree to the clause as proposed to be amended by the Minister, and that it should then be reprinted, so that we may have an opportunity of examining it and determining whether any further alteration is necessary. In that event we should make an effort to secure the recommittal of the clause. My object is to insure that internal quarantine arrangements will be carried out by the local authorities. </para>

I think that the honorable gentleman's amendment will meet the view of myself and others who wish to safeguard orchardists from unnecessary interference on the part of the Federal authorities. I shall therefore ask permission to withdraw my amendment. In doing so, I should like to refer to the point raised by the honorable member for Flinders, and to which he had previously directed attention, as to the extent to which the Federal control over quarantine becomes exclusive. The honorable member contends, I under-' stand, that when, under section 69, we take over the Quarantine Department, the control of quarantine becomes exclusively vested in the Commonwealth by virtue of paragraph 11. of section 52 of the Constitution.

                <para class="block">My reading of the words " matters relating to any Department " is that they mean matters relating to the organization of any Department, its officers, regulations, and management, its plant and its property. I am somewhat surprised to hear the contention that these words, properly read, mean that quarantine, as a legislative power, becomes exclusively vested in the Commonwealth. I cannot agree with that contention. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree that by section 52 the legislative power in quarantine becomes exclusively vested in the Commonwealth. I believe that to the extent to which Federal legislation occupies the field of action, so to speak, and expressly displaces States laws, it will be exclusive; but Federal legislation need not necessarily occupy the whole field. We may take over or exercise only a fraction of the power, and the residue of that power will remain with the States. </para>

                        <para>- But a "Department " merely means the officers and other persons conducting the administration of the law ; it does not mean the law itself. A Department is merely an agent for the enforcement of the law. The honorable member for Flinders also expressed some concern with regard to what was to become of the Stock Boards of Queensland, as well as other local health agencies. I would point out that " quarantine," as  understood under the Constitution, is merely a protective measure. . Its definition does not include eradication. It merely includes the power to wall in, so to speak, an infected area. The power of eradication would still be vested in the local stock, sanitary, or other boards. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not wish to needlessly draw attention to technical matters of drafting ; but very often big things are affected by the phraseology of a measure. I do not think that the Bill contains a reference to contagious diseases or infectious diseases as being the subject of quarantine. Except by inference from the use of the words " spread " or " introduction," we have not the effect of the specific provisions in the English Act, and in some of the States Acts, under which the diseases dealt with are contagious or infectious. Therefore, what may seem to be an innocent wording may convey larger powers than the Committee wishes to give. For instance, it might be possible to declare a quarantine area in respect of a fever which is not infectious. The English Act deals with epidemic, endemic, and infectious and contagious diseases. Paragraph h provides that the Governor- General may, by proclamation - </para>

                <para>There two provisions are joined together which should be separated. The technical reading of the provision is that there may be a quarantine area declared in respect to a disease affecting a plant, which shall apply not only to plants but also to animals. What is meant is that a quarantine area may be proclaimed in relation to plants, and apply to plants only, if a disease affecting plants exists there, and that, similarly, a quarantine area may be proclaimed applying only to animals. I suggest the insertion after the words "to be " of the words " in respect to animals or plants., as the case may be." Some such words as those should be inserted. The defect to' which I draw attention exists in nearly all the paragraphs. </para>

As it has been suggested, in regard to this amendment, that the honorable gentleman has stolen my clothes, I wish to make an explanation which should absolve him from that charge. Yesterday morning, I took the draft of my amendment to the Attorney-General, to consult him on one or two points connected with it, and I feel sure that, had he known that a similar amendment had been prepared at the instance of. another Minister, he would have informed me of the fact. I have since learned that the Government amendment was in the hands of the parliamentary draftsman, unknown to tha Attorney-General. </para>

Before dealing with my amendment, I may be permitted a passing reference to the remarks of the honorable member for Flinders - with which I entirely agree, notwithstanding what has been said by the honorable member for Bendigo - ' in regard to the sphere within which the Commonwealth law when passed will become supreme, superseding the laws of the States. Unless I am much mistaken - I have not had an opportunity to look up the Constitution - the Commonwealth could have taken over the quarantine departments of the States by proclamation, exactly as it took over the Defence Departments, and could have worked them with no greater inefficiency than they are being worked now, so far as oversea quarantine is concerned, under conflicting laws and regulations. It would have been inconvenient to do so, just as it was inconvenient to control the defence forces under the separate Defence Acts of the States before a Commonwealth Defence Act was passed. The Commonwealth, however, could have controlled quarantine during the last five or six years under the State Acts, making this measure practically a consolidating one. This view of the question is well worthy of consideration in connexion with what was said by the honorable member for Flinders. </para>

This amendment has the advantage over that of the Minister in that it makes the intervention of the Commonwealth authorities a much more formal matter. The Governor- General must be satisfied, and certify that necessity has arisen, and, secondly, the notice of the intention to intervene must be given to the Government of the State affected. It has been urged by some who have read the proposed amendment that it will create friction, but it seems to me that. the formalities involved are less likely to lead to friction than would a sudden intervention without notice. As I mentioned last night, the knowledge that it is necessary to formally certify, and to give notice, would mean that instead of these formalities, there would be a friendly communication as between one Government and another, and experts would be appointed and consulted, so that in all probability the powers would never be exercised. </para>

                        <para>. - Some remarks have been made as to the similarity of the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Brisbane and an amendment which I intend to submit myself. I may explain that last Friday one or two honorable members, amongst others the honorable member for Franklin, spoke to me on the matter. I had not then decided how far I should go, but the honorable member whom I have named desired to be able to make some statement in reference to the question in Tasmania. As a result, I gave instructions that afternoon to the parliamentary draftsman to prepare an amendment in harmony with the other parts of the Bill. On the following Tuesday, the Attorney-General told me that the draft was ready ; and I have to say that I never saw or heard of the amendment of the honorable member for Brisbane until I came here to-night. I am sorry that the honorable member submitted the amendment, because I cannot accept it. I regard the proposal which I have had prepared as much more workable than that now before the Committee. For instance, the honorable member for Brisbane desires it provided that the Governor-General must be satisfied and certify, and I take it that that means certifying before the proclamation is issued. </para>

                    <para>.- The chief difference between the two amendments seems to be that one gets control over human beings, whereas the other does not. I think the 'Minister is right, and that the States are not likely to object to our using our powers in connexion with human beings; all the remonstrances have been in connexion with animals and plants. Otherwise, however, so far as I can see, the effect of the Minister's amendment is really the same as that of the honorable member for Brisbane. Would it not be better for the Minister to ask the honorable member for Brisbane to accept the Minister's amendment in substitution for his own? To get over the Minister's objection to the Governor-General having to certify, the words of the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act might be used, so as to have the terminology of Acts for the same purpose identical. </para>

That section also relates to health matters. In regard to jurisdiction, I believe the honorable member for Bendigo put the matter very correctly when he said that the exclusive power under section 52 has nothing to do wilh our legislative powers, but deals purely with matters of administration.

At the same time, I would suggest that we have now reached the very kernel of the Bill, and as the evening is getting late I think that the Minister should consent to adjourn the debate so as to allow honorable members an opportunity to consider the whole position. </para>

                    <para>. - I quite agree with the .Acting Prime Minister that he has given ample opportunity for the discussion of this clause. When we were. prepared to go to a division upon it the honorable member for Flinders interposed a constitutional question, despite the fact that the constitutionality or otherwise of our action was very exhaustively discussed yesterday upon the initiative of the honorable member for Angas. It is no new experience for us to find lawyers differing from one another, and the fact that the honorable member for Flinders entertains a different view from that expressed by the honorable member for Angas possibly points to the conclusion that the former is not to be accepted as a great authority upon this question. We must recollect that the honorable member for Angas was a member of the Federal" Convention, and is well versed in the constitutionality or otherwise of our . procedure. Certainly his opinion is quite as worthy of acceptance as that of the Honorable member for Flinders.  I say that the Acting Prime Minister is taking up a reasonable position in contending that this clause should be dealt with before we adjourn. At the present time two proposals are practically before the Committee. One has been submitted by the honorable member for Brisbane. Had the Acting Prime Minister not suggested another amendment which is terser and very much preferable to that proposed by the honorable member for Brisbane, no doubt we should have been content to accept the latter. But seeing that the proposal of the honorable member for Brisbane necessitates an adverse judgment being given upon the management of the States Quarantine Departments, I think that it would be an act of grace upon his part to withdraw it in favour of. that of the Minister. </para>

                    <para>.- Considerable weight is to be attached to the remarks of the honorable member for Robertson in regard to the wording of the amendment. But his observations only strengthen the request which has been made that honorable members should be afforded a further opportunity to consider this clause. The Minister said that one of his objections to the amendment circulated by the honorable member for Brisbane was that it would involve some delay in giving effect to the law. That, to my mind, is not an objectionable feature. I may say, in passing, that I should have moved the omission of subclause <inline font-style="italic">g.</inline> had I thought that there was any possibility of securing its excision, since I think that the Commonwealth should not interfere with the internal administration of the States. There is a danger of much- injury being done to different interests by reason of panic legislation. We have experienced something of the kind in Queensland, notwithstanding that the Administration has had a full knowledge of local conditions. So far, however, the State quarantine laws relating to stock have been excellently carried out, and I see no occasion for the Commonwealth t'o interfere with the internal administration of the States. It is only because I recognised that there was no likelihood of my securing the omission of sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> that I refrained from (proposing such an amendment, and decided to support that circulated by the honorable member for Brisbane as being the most for which we could hope. The delay in taking action, which his proposal might involve, would be a very useful safeguard, for the interests involved are very considerable. In connexion with the administration of the Queensland regulations relating to tick and other stock pests, hardship and loss have been suffered as the result of hasty and ill-considered action on the part of the local authorities, and' the danger must be accentuated when we have the Federal authority operating far away from the affected area, and having no knowledge of local conditions. The measures to which the amendment relates are not of great urgency. Before the Federal authority would be asked to step in much work would have been carried out bv the State. The power of the Commonwealth would be invoked only when it was thought that the time had arrived when it should step in. I think that the form of the amendment moved by the honorable member for Brisbane has much to commend it. Its wording might be so amended as to remove the objection that action under it would appear to be taken by the Commonwealth only because the States concerned were not properly carrying out the work allotted to them. I, therefore, think it would be fair to give the honorable member an opportunity to discuss the amendment with those who assisted him in drafting it before he is called upon to withdraw it. If the wording of the amendment were varied so as to remove the objection to which I have referred, I should much prefer it to that foreshadowed by the Minister. Every formality should be observed in invoking Commonwealth interference with the internal arrangements of a State. Such an action should be most circumspect, and the greater the leisure with which it is done, within reasonable limits, the better it will be. In that way, all chance of friction would be removed, and it is for this reason that I think the Minister should give us an opportunity to consult with the honorable member for Brisbane before the amendment is withdrawn. I suggest that unless that opportunity is given the honorable member for Brisbane should press his amendment, asking leave only to vary its wording. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Colonel FOXTON</inline>(Brisbane) [10.35]. - Holding as I do that the Bill has a tendency to go very much further than I think it ought to do in regard to quarantine matters, it would be strange if I did not prefer the more sweeping reservations in my own amendment to those of the amendment foreshadowed by the Minister. Although I prefer my own amendment, more especially as it would compel the observance of certain formalities before the Commonwealth could prevent the passing of human beings from one State to another, still I recognise that, under existing circumstances, it is more than probable that if I pressed it to a division it would be rejected in favour of that which the Acting Prime Minister intends to move. In these circumstances, I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. </para>
