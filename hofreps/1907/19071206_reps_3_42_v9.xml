                        <para>- At the present time it would be premature to attempt to indicate the precise date' when we shall be able to deal with this question. But the first opportunity affording any guarantee that Parliament is able to come to a decision upon the question will be seized. There will certainly be no avoidable delay-. The honorable member will realise, as we do, that the whole of the difficulty in the settlement of the question arises from the fact that all except the supporters of the particular site most in favour, unite to prevent progress, in order that other sites which they prefer may have a chance of consideration. If we can overcome that obstacle, the Government may be relied upon to afford every facility for an early settlement of the question. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Prime Minister if his attention has been directed to some recent utterances by Captain Collins in London, referred to in cables which appeared in the. newspapers last week and to-day ? Last week's cables credited Captain Collins with having said that the preference now being given to Great Britain is only an earnest of future concessions in the same direction. I wish to ask what really is the position which Captain Collins occupies in London. Is fie a financial expert, an examiner of Defence stores, or a political agent generally ? Does the Prime Minister think it right that Australian public servants in London should take it upon themselves to represent his views on Australian policy at political gatherings? </para>

                        <para>- The position that Captain Collins occupies is that of an officer charged with certain definite duties in regard to purchases for the Defence Department, the conduct of other ordinary business, and also special duties which he is, from time to time, authorized to undertake. I have, noticed the semi-political remarks made by Captain Collins on one or two public occasions, but they have been such as I think no exception could be taken to, because in each case he has simply repeated, generally in the same words, statements which have been made on behalf of the Government, and chiefly by myself, either here or in England. I have not noticed that he has ever done more than repeat statements of that kind, or has made any statements of his own opinions. </para>

                            <para>- I think there is every objection to a public servant making statements which can have the slightest party bearing or which contain a political reference to any question then in contention. But while this officer is in London, and speaking at a gathering of a Colonial Club, where the members or audience consist almost wholly of Australians, it is not at. all out of order, in acknowledging the toast of the Commonwealth, to make statements of a general character when they are in harmony with the current opinion of the Commonwealth. Captain Collins does not speak with any personal accent ; and while I should be the first to jealously resist any attempt on the part of an officer to express opinions on political questions, a general statement of the development of the country or the movement of public affairs in the Commonwealth ought not to be too captiously criticised. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question without notice. A telegram appears in this morning's newspapers to the effect that the motion affirming the conditions on which the proposed surrender of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth has been passed by both Houses of the Parliament of South Australia. As the terms of the agreement involve the consent of South Australia to the survey and construction of a line to Western Australia, I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he can say what route is likely to be chosen for the construction of the railway, and whether in determining the route the Government will consider the advisableness of taking the line through country in South Australia that is susceptible of development? </para>

                        <para>- I have observed with great satisfaction the passage of the motion referred to in both Houses of the South Australian Parliament. In regard to the honorable gentleman's second question, so far as I am aware, there are but two alternative routes from Port Augusta which have been proposed as those which the future line should follow ; one to the north of Lake Gardiner and the other to the south, skirting the coast. The only advantages, so far as I am aware, claimed for the southern route, are that it would be somewhat shorter, and be more inexpensive to construct. But there are grave strategic dangers which must be taken into account when carrying an important connexion such as this would be so close to the sea, and therefore open at any time to possible severance from the sea. </para>

                            <para>- It would involve, I think, no very material increase in the length of the line. Although the purpose of such a railway would be to connect the western State with the eastern States, from which it is at present severed, the necessity for making the line self-supporting cannot be overlooked. Whichever route afforded the greatest possibilities of local earnings would naturally be selected. I am sure that any Federal Parliament , would lend an attentive ear to representations from either of the States through which it will pass, offered by those most competent to offer a valuable opinion. </para>

                            <para>- Before asking the Prime Minister a question without notice, I should like to refer to the very satisfactory news- of this morning, as to the passing of the Northern Territory resolution in the Legislative Council of South Australia. I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he will take steps to urge the South Australian Government to give their consent to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway survey, which was recently authorized by the Commonwealth Parliament, subject to the proviso that, before any money is expended the assent of the Parliament of South Australia must be obtained to the survey being made in that State. I make this request because it may be thought that the South Australian Parliament, having assented to the Northern Territory transfer Bill, which contains a provision authorizing the survey and construction of the railway through South Australia, from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, there is no necessity for its assent to the survey to which I have referred. I point out to the Prime Minister, however, that if that view were taken much undesirable delay would result, as some months may elapse before the Northern Territory Transfer Bill comes before the Federal Parliament. I think it only requires the question to be brought prominently under the notice of the South Australian Parliament, that the assent of the Parliament of that State is necessary before the Commonwealth Government can spend any funds on the survey, to insure immediate attention to the matter. It is most probable that the South Australian Government will attend to the matter with-, out any special request ; but still I should be glad if the Prime Minister will make a representation on the subject, as the matter is urgent. </para>

Can he say whether a communication was addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> the piano manufacturer, by the Customs authorities, supplying him with particulars as to the number and value of the pianos imported into the Commonwealth from 1902 to  T907?  Is the Minister aware that the Customs authorities, in furnishing the information, made serious errors? Has the fact that such errors have been made been communicated to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> and, if so, has the correction been communicated also to the importers? If not, can he say why? </para>

                        <para>- I- had not observed the paragraph in the paper this morning. There can be no objection to inquiring into the statements made. The responsibility of this Government for the introduction of those men is, as the honorable member is aware, indirect.  We gave permission that, provided suitable labour could not be obtained from the Mother Country, it might be obtained from Europe. Certain Spaniards some weeks ago occasioned trouble in the neighbourhood of Geraldton. I had inquiry made into that circumstance, and found that apparently not one of those who could be tested had been found to be familiar with country employment. They came from Spanish towns, unacquainted with any form of agriculture,  and familiar only with some employment - I forget the particulars - of a light and casual character. They appeared to be quite unsuited for the work to which they had been put. </para>

I desire to ask the Treasurer, whose skill as a manipulator of the strings we know is exceptional, and who, with an enviable delicacy of touch, is capable, without notice, of improvising variations that would almost beggar the genius of a Lizst, whether he will, before the item of pianos is reached, either by himself taking his place at the keyboard or otherwise, give us an opportunity of testing the resonance of the instrument? </para>

                            <para>- I should like to say that when the question of showing within this building a sheep'-shearing machine was brought up, I think by the honorable member for Lang, I was asked whether I would give similar permission in the case nf any other exhibit in the north lobby, and I said that I would. I took it that the House assented to the course I suggested, and when permission was sought later on for a piano to be placed in the lobby, I gave the desired consent, and hence the piano is there. </para>

                        <para>- I think the course suggested would be judicious, and shall certainly take it, although it may be desirable to wait until we see the denial in full. I had already noted both the paragraphs quoted by the honorable member, for the purpose of. giving' a contradiction, should the statement made by the head of the expedition disprove the allegation, as I feel confident that it will. ' Quite recently, when in England, I was met on a number of occasions by statements of this kind, which it was very difficult to refute at the moment. </para>

One had to reply as best one could on 'the spot. 1 quite recognise that action is necessary on behalf of Australia as a whole, not only because of the assumption in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> leading article, which was, evidently, written without a knowledge of the telegram appearing in another column, but also because information of the kind is cabled Home, and, what is more, is at once assumed by readers there to apply indiscriminately to the whole continent, and to the treatment of a "vast number of aborigines. After all, so far as these deplorable abuses are even alleged to occur, they include only individual cases. Less prominence is sometimes given abroad to famines in India, and catastrophes elsewhere, which destroy thousands, than to isolated injuries to particular aborigines in Australia. </para>

Both items are really in the same  category, and why one should be dutiable at 30 per cent, and the other at only 20 per cent. 1 cannot understand. I hope that the Treasurer will consent to a reduction of the rate proposed, because brushmakers' woodware and turnery are a very simple form of manufacture. </para>

                        <para>- Axe handles ave specially made out of a certain, description of American wood. We have no wood similar to that wood. This item covers innumerable handles of tools of trade. The old duty of 15 per cent was quite high enough, and the honorable member for Herbert has informed us that with that protection handles are made here. No doubt they are making some handles and making them profitably too with that protection. Therefore his argument is really in favour of restoring the old duty. </para>

                        <para>- As a general . rule, the honorable member does not believe that the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission was right in making a particular recommendation. I ask him to be consistent on this occasion* and say that it was wrong in recommending a duty of 20 per cent. He must know that throughout his electorate a large number of tool handles are used. Surely he is aware that the greater number of tool handles used in mining and agriculture are imported handles. I shall support the amendment, because I think that a duty of 15 per cent, is a perfectly fair one to impose. </para>

Every handle for a miner's pick is made out of spotted gum, and, generally, by an old miner, who earns a few shillings in that way. If ever there was an industry which could be said to be a poor man's industry it is the industry of making pick handles. </para>

                        <para>- What is more, tool handles are not made to shape in Australian wood as they are when imported, and, consequently, men who use them will "be able to do so much less work. Work in the bush is almost entirely done by the piece. If a bushman has an .axe handle of the right shape, 'he will be able to do more work with less fatigue than if he has a. badly-shaped handle. I believe that the only handle that can be made satisfactorily, in this country in competition with imported handles is the handle for the pick: of the miner, or something of that kind. Such a handle is almost straight, or tapers away to the end. I believe that Australian wood is as good as imported timber for that particular purpose. But a handle for almost every other tool has a turn in it somewhere ; and it is putting in that turn, that involves labour. The output of Australian handles must necessarily be small.. It cannot be expected that we can com-, pete against a. country like the United! States, with '80,000,000 people, or against' Great Britain with her enormous population. Therefore, this would be exclusively a tax upon the wage-earner. It would mean' increasing the revenue from this source from  1^4,280  probably to ^5,000 more,, and that money would have to be paid by the wage-earners. I hope that the Treasurer will give some consideration to the question from that point of view. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Robertson has; entered a plea for the working man  who  uses tool handles. But the handles which are made in Australia are made by men who are working " on their own," and not: in factories. I have in my mind a number of men in my own electorate who have brought up their families by making; handles for tools. They have been able-, to do this work owing to the protection, they had under the old Victorian Tariff. The wood they have used for making handles has been ironbark, which wears'down to a very smooth surface, and complies with the conditions correctly mentioned by the honorable member for Newcastle. </para>

                        <para>- They sell them locally. It is all very well for those who are interested in large tracts of forest country, which they have taken up for purposes of exploitation, to endeavour to get these special concessions. But  1  notice that they are not so anxious for reductions of duty when we are dealing with timber. I do plead with honorable members to recollect that this is not a large capitalistic industry, but one carried on by individuals who work hard for their living. Those who vote to take away from these men the only means of subsistence which "they have, are taking upon themselves a very grave responsibility. </para>

                    <para>.- . We have been supplied with a lot of use- " less knowledge about axe handles, and the honorable member for Newcastle has told us that pick handles for miners can be made out of spotted gum. They can be made out of deal, so far as that goes, and can be worn down very smooth. But when a man has to get his living by swinging an axe he must have a handle so cut as to make the blade fall with the greatest possible weight where it is wanted, and as true as can be. An axe handle is quite different from a pick handle. I have no desire to interfere with the Newcastle miners. If they choose to encourage their old men to make pick handles and scrape them smooth with a bit of glass paper, let them do it. But we have in Western Australia 4,000 or 5,000 men. engaged in the timber industry. </para>

                        <para>- I am connected with two companies who employ 500 axemen. We use from 25 to 30 cases of axes per month, with the necessary number of extra handles. If that experience is not worth more to the Committee than that of a doctor or a coal miner I am very much surprised. We do not object to old men in the bush making a few handles out of whatever wood they can obtain. They can make them out of broomsticks if they like. But the Committee should not interfere with a big industry such as we are running in Western Australia. We have imposed a duty of 15 per cent, on some tools of trade. </para>

                        <para>- I am- asking that the duty be reduced. Axemen and others have to purchase from the companies by which they are employed the handles that they require. If they were given the full run of the store the employer - would not be able to get enough for them. It is necessary that they should purchase them from their employers in order that some control may be kept over their use. I have no objection to the honorable member for Newcastle having pick handles made out of deal. </para>

                    <para>. - I was surprised to hear the statement made a few moments ago that tool handles could not be made in Australia, since I knpw that they can be produced in all parts of the Commonwealth. I have a small farm near Brisbane where, when Parliament is not in session, I spend a good deal of time and make from timber on the ground all -the tool handles that. I need. I find them nearly as good as any that are imported from America. I think that we ought to encourage an industry of this kind, and shall therefore vote for a duty. </para>

                        <para>- I regret very much that, although the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, when in London, talked largely/ of preferential trade, they have not kept faith with Great Britain. The principle of preference so far as this Parliament is concerned has been nothing but a sham. We ought to be prepared to make some little sacrifice to the Motherland. This Parliament has not dealt fairly with Great Britain, and I repeat that the promises made by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer when in the Old Country have not ' been fulfilled. </para>

                    <para>.- For the information of the Committee I should like to say that when I was in the north last year, I visited at Cairns a timber mill where I saw tool handles being freely produced. A shaping machine is used, and the timber is rapidly converted into pick or axe handles. First-class timber is available in the district, and a bushman whom I met there told me that he  was taking back with him a dozen locally-produced axe handles, which had cost from 1s. 6d. to1s.  9d.  per dozen less than the imported article, and which, he said, were not only, cheaper, but better, than the imported handles. </para>

                        <para>- The duty under the old Tariff was  15  per cent. Whilst we may be able to produce some excellent .tool handles, I  would point out that there is a special class of axe handle, as well as adze, pick, and scythe handles, which should come in at a lower rate. The statement made by the honorable member for Fremantle, that it is the custom for bush-workers to purchase their handles from their employers, is correct, and as in some cases an imported handle is absolutely necessary this duty will fall directly upon the men who use them. I, therefore, hope that, in the interests of these men, the Committee will agree to my amendment. </para>

                    <para>- In my constituency there are  5,000  timbergetters, and every one of them uses an imported hickory axe handle for the reason that it is found to be the most suitable that can be obtained. If Queensland can supply axe handles that are equally good, why does she not give us some evidence of it? I hope that the Government will revert to the duty which prevailed under the old Tariff. This item relates to tools of trade and will be a tax upon the working man. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer might well consent to insert a new paragraph relating to bent handles. I feel disposed to support the Government proposal in regard to straight handles, which can be satisfactorily manufactured in Australia from locally-grown timbers ; ' but as the evidence submitted to us this afternoon is that scythe, adze, and axe handles of the most suitable kind are not. at present being made here, it would be well to subject them to a lower duty. </para>

                    <para>.- The special pleading to which" I have listened in connexion with this paragraph has occasioned me some surprise. I was brought up in the bush and have often seen youths make from locally-grown timbers axe handles equal to those imported from America. The honorable member for Herbert has spoken of the machinery in Queensland timber mills for making tool handles, and we all know that we have in Australia timber suitable for such a purpose. We have skilled men capable of turning out the very best handles, and they should receive some encouragement. We have been told that so far as these articles are concerned Australia cannot compete with America,, but we should not forget that the United States owes her position to-day to the way in which she has built up her industries. If we wish to succeed we must encourage every industry, and perhaps the day will come when we shall be able to export tool handles of all descriptions. </para>

                        <para>. - Why this extraordinary and unjustifiable increase from 20 to 35 per cent. ? I wish that the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission, whose example the Minister is evidently following in connexion with this item, would explain why it is necessary to propose a 75 per cent, increase of duty. I could understand some of these huge duties, from a protectionist point of view, being placed upon articles which require rare and special skill, but this is an article whose manufacture calls for only the most rudimentary skill. </para>

                        <para>.- A mass of evidence was given, with reference to the picture frame making industry and moulding industry. The honorable member for Parramatta will find it summarized on page 479 of the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. The manufacturers complained that they were being inundated with cheap picture frames from America, lightly constructed and attractive in appearance,, and that they had to face fierce and intense competition. They also pointed out that in Australia they had to pay duty on the moulding, which was their raw material. In this matter two industries have to be considered - the making of mouldings and the making of picture frames. Of course the picture frame maker would like his mouldings free, but on the other hand a number of manufacturers arte engaged in making splendid mouldings of Australian timber. Samples cf them were exhibited in this building yesterday. Some made from Queensland timbers would defy the world for brilliancy of finish and excellence of workmanship. </para>

                            <para>- The Committee last night unanimously increased the duty on mouldings from 20 to' 30 per cent. It was felt that we ought to promote the moulding industry, which is the basis and foundation of the picture frame making industry. Having increased the duty on the raw material, we should raise rather than reduce the duty on picture frames, as the interests of the Australian manufacturers should be considered. In fact,  1  understand that the honorable member fo: Kooyong has received this morning a letter, in which the picture frame makers complain of the altered incidence of the duties, and ask for the addition of an alternative duty of 4d. per foot. I can assure the honorable member for Parramatta that the duty on this item ought to be increased, rather than reduced. </para>

They point . out that- there is a big industry in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, and that, in consequence of the cheap picture frames which are introduced from various parts of Germany, it would be hopeless for them to expect to make any profit out of the business. I have no personal knowledge as to whether their representations are correct, but they are a most reputable firm, and their statements may safely be taken as fair and reasonable. They say that, owing to the importation of the  3- ply  veneer to Australia, the importation of manufactured frames had been almost knocked out under the old Tariff, with the exception of a few of very inferior quality, but if the duties were to remain as they now stand, all those who are now making picture frames in Australia must close up. There must be thirty firms manufacturing these frames in Australia at present, and it would be a most serious matter to the whole industry to reduce the proposed duty. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope the honorable member will not press the amendment. The duty proposed, as against the United Kingdom, is recommended bv the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, while the free-tra'de section recommend  20  per cent., which is nearly as high. I took the recommendation of the former for the United Kingdom column, and proposed a dutvof3  5  per cent, in the General Tariff column, in order to give -a preference  of 10  per cent. When both sections of . the Tariff ' Commission so nearly agree, there must be some verv strong reason in the evidence why a substantial duty should be imposed. </para>

When that scheme is departed from; these recommendations simply go by the board ; and the Treasurer appears to have quite overlooked this governing factor. I shall support the proposal to make the item free. </para>

One witness said that he was already making  250  a day, and yet the imports were much in excess of the local production. The Tariff Commission was also informed that it is very desirable to have lasts manufactured here, in order to meet the constantly changing requirements of the bootmaking trade. </para>

It would appear that the Department or the Minister - I do not know which - is now legislating by regulation in a different wav from that intended by Parliament; and the seriousness of the position leads me to call attention to the matter at the earliest possible moment.

We here decided that certain articles from Great Britain should receive preference, whatever proportion of labour might be involved; but the Department or the Minister now requires that the labour must be equal to 25 per cent. Our decision had no reference to the labour employed, but merely required that the article should be produced or manufactured in Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- Let me point out that although sugar does not grow in the United Kingdom, a preference is given in the case of British contectionery. Is that preference to be withheld in every instance in which 25 per cent, of British labour has not been employed? If this regulation be enforced, there will be not only enormous difficulty caused to the exporter and to the Department, but also an absolute departure from the decision at which we arrived, knowing that in the case of many articles 25 .per cent, of British or any labour was not employed. In fact, the labour in some articles might not be 5 per cent, of their value. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall be very glad to . give consideration to the representations of the honorable member for North Sydney.  In dealing with this matter, our aim has been to attain as far as possible uniformity throughout the Empire. This preferential idea is spreading, and if there be "uniformity it will make the administration much smoother. The regulations, as a matter of fact, are identical with the preferential regulations in other parts of the Empire ; and we must be very careful to give preference to goods that are really British, and not to goods which just flit through Great Britain on their way to Australia. If preference- be given to goods of the latter class, we shall place Great Britain at a disadvantage, and, in. fact, defeat the very object we have in view. I am pleased that the honorable member has raised the question, and I shall look further into it. </para>

                            <para>- I allowed the honorable member for North Sydney to call attention' to this matter, and the" Minister to reply. It is true that that was slightly irregular; but I regarded the question as important enough to justify the latitude given. I must ask honorable members, however, not to debate further the general question of preference. </para>

                            <para>- I am inclined to agree with the honorable member. If we wish to levy high imposts, do not let us disguise them by substituting specific duties for <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates. The Treasurer asks that a fixed duty shall be imposed upon buggy shafts, bent, but not dressed, notwithstanding that under the old Tariff they were admitted free. I would further point but that these shafts are a portion of the raw material of the coach-, builder. They are made mainly from hickory and American ash. </para>

                            <para>- The coachbuilders think that it is. The fixed duty now proposed would work most inequitably, in that it would fall equally upon the lowest and the highest grade of buggy shafts. In other words, the same charge would be levied upon the cheapest and the most expensive shafts. The duty proposed would also be a tax upon all those in the country districts who use buggies. I suggest that buggy shafts in the rough should be admitted free, and that shafts bent and dressed should be dutiable at is. 6d. per pair, or at an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate of 20  per cent. </para>

                            <para>- The duty proposed will fall heaviest upon the small, coachbuilders who are carrying on operations in country districts. We must recollect that they have to place their manufactures upon the market at a price approximating that at which the large manufacturers are able to sell. There is scarcely a country town in New South Wales in which there is not to be found a blacksmith who is also a coachbuilder and buggymaker. He usually devotes the"slack" period of the year to the manufacture of sulkies and buggies, which vehicles are commonly used in rural areas. He is unable to procure his raw material locally. As a matter of fact the greater portion of it - especially for the lighter class of vehicles - must be imported. The general consensus of opinion among buggy manufacturers is that hickory and other woods will continue to be imported irrespective of the duty which may be imposed" upon them. A high duty will only operate in the direction of limiting the output of vehicles made of these materials. The contention of the buggy manufacturers is that the proposals of the Government in respect of the group of items to which I have referred will operate . distinctly to their detriment. I should like the Committee to understand that this industry is a very considerable one, that it is not concentrated in the big cities, but that it is distributed' throughout our small centres. The proposals of the Government, if agreed to, will have the effect of concentrating the industry in the large manufacturing shops of the cities. Is that a wise result to bring about? If the Committee is prepared to look beyond the interests of the timber-getters some modification of the proposal immediately under consideration must be adopted. </para>

They declare that under the old Tariff they were enabled to' build up their industry to such ah extent that their annual output was valued at, approximately, ,£2,000,000. As against that large sum, our total importations were valued at only ,£10,000. The members of the Coachbuilders' and Wheelwrights' Association hold that they have so completely got the control of the industry, that they do not fear importations. </para>

                            <para>- I have .no doubt that Australian timber will be used where it can be clone profitably. But the men who are engaged in the trade assert that for the lighter vehicle and the lighter work in vehicles, they are compelled to make these importations or to cease the "manufacture of vehicles. They say that for the heavier work in their trade they can secure Australian timber, and that they use it wherever it can be done with advantage. But they contend that the smaller parts for the lighter conveyances, such as buggies and sulkies, and the parts of those conveyances which require durability and strength must be . imported. The association I mentioned state in their circular that the imports of softwoods amount to about 115,000,000 feet pew annum, and that out of the large quantity required only 4,500,000 feet can be obtained from Queensland. That indicates to what a small extent, even in those particular lines which are not the main lines for which an exemption is required, the Commonwealth is able to meet the great demand for these kinds of wood. The association also state that within the -last two years the prices of such woods in the Commonwealth have advanced fully 50 per cent., and that the manufacturers have to pay 50 per cent, more to-day than they did a few years ago. That is only in accord with the' general rise in the prices of all the timbers that are used. I am not an expert in this matter, and, therefore, I have to rely for my information upon those who are engaged in the trade. Perhaps I may be permitted to read a few extracts from a letter I have received from a manufacturer in a country town with whom I am acquainted. I know that his opinion is worthy of every consideration, and that his statements can be relied upon. He is managing a company that has gradually grown from a small beginning to fairly large dimensions. He writes - </para>

At the present time we employ about twenty-five hands, and I must say that had we to contend in the earlier stages with these excessive duties we would never have built our business up to what it is to-day. We have mechanics who have Been in our employ for years, and if these duties are imposed it will mean, in place of increasing our plant, we must reduce the number of hands employed by us, and our' business will be one more of repairing than of manufacturing, for when the prices are increased the demand is always lessened. It would suit us to have the additional duties taken off, which i consider is a fair thing, knowing that there is a specific duty on vehicles, &amp;c. Spring carts, drays, and waggon wheels are all made from Colonial timber, and that shows clearly that if hickory was procurable here we would not mind the imposition of the additional duties. </para>

                            <para>- He is a good protectionist, like my honorable friends who interject. It is only the very necessity of the position that compels him to ask for the reduction of the duties on the American timbers which must be used. He says that the position has reached this acute stage : that those who give orders to  America for such timbers have to wait for a period extending to eighteen months until they can be executed. So that there are difficulties even in getting the timbers from America, and that in itself would be sufficient to induce the manufacturers to use colonial timbers wherever it was possible to do so. If honorable members will refer to the Tariff of Canada, they will see that an exception is made in favour of hickory and the other timbers which are required for the manufacture of coaches and buggies, and which are being imported to Australia. The same thing obtains in New Zealand ; in fact, in every protectionist country in which those special timbers are not grown. In such countries these timbers are regarded as the raw materials of the coachbuilders and wheelwrights, and because they cannot be locally produced they are placed on the free list. We are asked by the Coachbuilders' and Wheelwrights' Association to follow the examples of those countries. They ask that the specific duties generally be eliminated, and replaced with <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties. They hold that a specific duty falls as heavily on the lighter and less expensive vehicle as on the heavier and more expensive vehicle. . The less expensive vehicles are used by the poorer classes, and if these duties are retained the burden of this taxation will fall upon them in a measure out of proportion to their more wealthy countrymen. As regards their raw material, this association have expressed their readiness to accept the old duties. They recommend that the more complete the manufactured article is the higher <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty it should bear, until the completed article is reached, when, of course, they are prepared to accept any duty which the Committee may impose, so far as lis maximum is concerned. They ask that in the interests of their industry their representations may receive the favorable consideration of the Committee. Whether they -be free-traders or protectionists, they are unanimously of the opinion that this schedule, if it is passed, will do a very grave injury to their industry ; and that a number of the articles which are heavily taxed in the interest of Australian timbers must be imported because they cannot be produced here. I am prepared to support the amendment of the honorable member for Dalley, because under the old Tariff this industry was able to so completely capture the consumption in the Common-  wealth that less than£10,000 covered the importations. </para>

I would suggest that the words, "including poles, swingle-bars and shaft bars made of hickory in the rough - free," be added to the item. If the Minister will not consent to that, it appears to me that we shall have to take the whole of these items separately. </para>

                    <para>The reasons for this amendment are that experience of the new item has shown that in practically every instance in which casks containing dry goods or goods other than fluids are imported, the casks are to all intents 'and purposes of no value when emptied of their imported contents. Such casks as those containing pickled cabbage, olives, sheep dip, &amp;c, have been brought under the notice of the Department as being casks which are valueless after being emptied of their imported contents. Hitherto, the practice of the Department has been  to deal with each case on its merits, and allow the casks to be entered as of no value for duty in those cases in which they were of no value as casks when emptied. Whilst a strict reading of the present wording of this item would require that the value of the casks containing goods subject to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty should be included in the value of those goods for duty, and. in addition, that the special duty placed on casks under this item should be charged, the practice of the Department is to charge only the. special duty under this item, and to exclude the value of the casks from the value of their <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> contents for dutv. The proposed amendment: will give legislative effect to this practice, and will afford relief both to the Department and  tG  the public without injuring the local coopering trade. The substance of the explanation which I have given is that when casks are imported containing such goods as printers' ink or olives they are of no further use. Therefore, it is not considered fair to charge duty on them. But when wine casks or whisky casks, which can be used again, are brought in, duty is charged on them. It is most unfair to charge, duty on casks which simply have to be broken up for firewood. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. The casks in which goods are brought here cannot be made in the country, and if a duty of 35 per cent, is charged on them, it will in many cases greatly increase the gross duty on their contents, which may be dutiable nominally at much lower rates. Sometimes, casks have to be used for the importation of comparatively cheap goods, or of goods upon which the duty is very small. Although the proposal has been put forward with a view to assisting the coopering industry, it may really have the effect of taking some work from the coopers. Most of the tallow casks and many other casks used in Australia are made from local timbers, but there are casks for which only imported timbers can be used, and if they are not remade from imported casks the timber for them will have to be imported in staves, or in the rough, ready to be cut up into staves. By keeping out the casks we shall take from the coopers a good deal of the business in re-making which now goes on. No one would import casks if he could get here casks made of suitable material ; but for some purposes special timber is requisite. It may be necessary to use an absolutely tasteless timber, or a non-porous timber, or a timber possessing some other special quality which can be obtained only in imported wood. </para>

                            <para>- The casks which are imported filled with liquid or goods are, after being emptied, sold for less than their cost, and some of them may be exported; but I maintain that it is not a proper thing, after it has been determined that a certain commodity shall bear a certain duty, to increase that duty by imposing a heavy rate on the package in which it is brought out. </para>

                            <para>- I think it merely implies contents. Would the honorable member say that where goods are imported in small packages within an outside package the outside package should be admitted free, but that when they are packed in it in bulk it should not be regarded as an outside package? I do not think that that would be a fair rule to make. In my opinion the present practice should continue. , The importers are accustomed to it, and the proposed change will create considerable confusion, without giving effective protection to coopers. I wish to amend the original item by moving - </para>

                        <para>.- The importation of casks was brought before the Tariff Commission by a witness who represented the Coopers' Association. He strongly objected to the practice of allowing full casks to be imported free of duty, because, when emptied, they have a marketable value. </para>

                            <para>- The importers sometimes dispose of them at good prices, and occasionally dump them on the market at very low prices.. Sometimes these casks are well and strongly built, and are very valuable ; but they are sacrificed or sold at a very low price indeed, and thus come into competition, with the locally-made casks and barrels. . The coopers say that if a duty were placed upon these casks, the importers would be induced to add the duty to the price they demanded for these discarded casks, and that that would lessen the extent of their competition with the locally-made article by bringing up their- price more nearly to that demanded for locally-made casks. </para>

The coopers say that these second-hand casks have a life of from ten to twenty years. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think they would increase the price of the contents to the consumer by the amount of the duty imposed on the casks. I think they would try to recover the duty by charging more for the empty casks, and that would to some extent prevent them being dumped on the market as they are at the present time in competition with the new casks locally made. That is the coopers' case, and I think there is a great deal in it. If these casks were sold at their legitimate value there would not be the same competition with locally-made casks. </para>

                            <para>- One witness who appeared before the Tariff Commission said that, in Victoria alone, upwards of 15,000 second-hand casks are placed on the market every year in competition with new casks locally made. I think that the proposal submitted by the Treasurer is better, because more discriminating, than that recommended by the Tariff Commission. It  will not impose a duty on ink casks, pitch casks, or other casks that have no marketable value when emptied of their contents, but only on casks which have a legitimate and considerable market value. I think that is a fair thing. </para>

                        <para>. - I feel disposed to vote in favour of a substantial duty in order that the work of making casks shall be retained for our local' coopers. I am prepared to be guided by the advice of the authorities on the question whether the duty should be a fixed or an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. But I must say that on the question now before the Committee the argument to which we have listened from the honorable member for Bendigo is quite beside the mark. I could understand the honorable member pleading: for a special duty on full casks if that would have the effect of reducing the number imported, because that would give a wider market to the Australian industry.. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member admits that the imposition of a duty on full casks would not reduce by a single, cask the number imported. Therefore, the only possible result of the imposition of such a duty would be to add to the cost of the contents imported in these casks, and the argument that it would lessen the competition with the locally-made article is immediately exploded. I remind honorable members of the course adopted by the Committee in dealing with tanks imported, as packages for goods, and which also come into competition with a local industry. </para>

                            <para>- It would be verv much easier to' find other means for importing the goods which are imported in tanks than it would be to find other means of importing the liquids which are now imported' in casks. The appeal for the poor farmer, as the honorable member for Melbourne Ports says, might have led the Committee  to take the course it did in dealing with' full tanks, but that does not alter the position in this case. Casks will continue to be imported whether a duty is imposed upon them or not, and they must continue to come into competition with the local article. </para>

                            <para>- These casks may be waste products, but they have a certain value, and I am at a loss to understand how the imposition of a dutv upon them will increase their value, which must be determined, by their fitness for any use to which it might be desired to put them. I think the best thing we can do is to maintain the conditions which prevailed under the old Tariff, and impose a duty upon the next item, which would secure to the coopers of Australia the making of the casks required in this country. </para>

                        <para>. - I did not desire to say anything at this stage. Casks, barrels, and vats are valued for Customs purposes at 22s. 6d. for hogsheads and 14s. 6d. for quarter casks. In the case of hogsheads, containing about 60 gallons, the duty proposed would amount to an added tax of about 2½d. per gallon for the casings alone. That seems to me to. be an extraordinary amount of duty to charge on casings. As the honorable member for . Kalgoorlie has pointed out, liquid contents must be brought here in something. I wish to see Australian woods used wherever possible in connexion with all our manufactures, but I suppose it will be admitted that it would be impracticable, at present, to send Australian woods to Great Britain for the manufacture of the casks to be shipped back to Australia with goods. I am quite willing that an effective protective duty should be placed upon empty casks. * The people who use casks do not desire to import empty casks,' but as primary producers they do expect to be able to obtain as cheaply as possible casks imported with contents, on which duty has already been paid. I wish the Treasurer to think that oyer. I suppose I can claim to have tried as much to advance Australian industries as the Treasurer has done. I have had some thousands of Australian casks made, but seven 'years ago my advices were that if I shipped wines in casks made of Australian woods they, would be refused. I can tell honorable members why. I heard the Treasurer mention mountain ash and also blackwood as suitable timbers for casks. </para>

I cannot use them, and I should like the honorable gentleman to take them off my hands, because they are becoming worm-eaten, and are an eyesore to me. I shipped a few hundred hogsheads, and there were complaints that the casks, though they had been treated with caustic soda to purify them, tainted the wine. The wood is too bitter. It is splendid for cabinet purposes, but it is not good for shipping wines or liquids that must maintain a special flavour-. </para>

                            <para>- If they. did they lost their shipping business. I remember Albury thirty years ago, as the Treasurer does. I have had large quantities of mountain ash casks made in Melbourne. They are of no commercial value after they reach London. Merchants will not buy' them. At Home they get a fixed price of 5s. for secondhand hogsheads. The great majority of the Australian woods, besides tainting the ' contents, are too brittle. I desire to encourage the use of Australian casks, and would place an order to-morrow if I were told where I could get Australian wood fit to make casks suitable for wine for the British trade. I could give the names of men who have made casks in Melbourne. There is little or no demand for them for shipping wine, though they are used for holding tallow and other things. The goods contained in full casks imported  have already paid a high duty, and surely it is not desired to charge a second duty On the casks. As the honorable member for Kalgoorlie pointed out, those casks are practically a by-product, and . are sold for whatever they will bring in the open market. When empty, they only bring 5s. each at Home. I imported' a large numLer of casks from Sydney last year because I was shipping a fair quantity at the time.  I got them put on board at 10s., while similar casks, if made here, would have cost me <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> apiece. That is a consideration to me, because I can charge nothing for the casks in selling my produce. It is only fair and right, in the interest of the primary producer, that full casks should be admitted free, as they were under the old Tariff. A duty on them will be a tax on the primary producer. If the Treasurer wishes to encourage the making of casks here, I do not object to . his imposing a higher duty on empties than is proposed in the Tariff ; but I strongly object to any tax on casks that come here full. </para>

                            <para>- It is certain that the two  contentions cannot be right. A  dutv  cannot lower the price in one case and raise it in another. The difficulty I am in about this item is that, if the duty on full casks is increased, the importer will simply put the increased cost on to the price of the liquid, and get his profit out of that. He will still sell the casks as he does now at the highest price he can. get. Being- unable to get any explanation from the honorable and learned member for Bendigo of the enigma of a duty in one case lowering, and in another case raising the price to the consumer - each side of the case being advocated by protectionists - I shall resume my seat. </para>

                        <para>.- The coopers complain more bitterly of the second-hand hogsheads than of the new ones. It is suggested that the second-hand ones should be dealt- with separately. It would be very unfair to impose the same <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate of duty on a second-hand as on a new cask, because, where the new might be worth£1 or 25s., the secondhand, although nearly as good, would be valued at only from 6s. to 10s. Therefore an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate would hardly be a fair basis, especially as the second-hand article might have a long life and come into competition with the locally-made article. I am told that many second-hand hogsheads are imported and sold at low prices. I therefore submit that an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty would not be a fair, reasonable, or effective way of dealing with second-hand hogsheads, and that a fixed duty should be imposed upon them. </para>

                        <para>.- An <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty in the case of shooks will be altogether ineffective - they are the greatest curse of the coopering trade. If the Treasurer desires to give any assistance to coopers, there ought to be a fixed duty imposed on shooks. These are imported in bundles from Calcutta and other places in India, the staves having been separated and numbered in order that they may be put together on their arrival in Australia. Packed in this way, they take up small space, and are carried at low rates. A hogshead, originally worth  25s.  in Calcutta,- is broken up into a shook and sold at  6s.  This is the last appeal I shall make on behalf of the coopers, and I urge strongly that an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty will be entirely ineffective. </para>

                        <para>.- On behalf of the coopers, I feel even more interested in the duty on shooks than I am in the duty on barrels. I should not object to the duty on the complete barrel being reduced, but, as I have already indicated, the importation of these shooks are really destroying the coopers' trade, which, as such, is dying out. So long as this importation goes on, it is found impossible to train apprentices to the coopering trade, because all they are required to do is to fit the staves together. The coopers will be greatly disappointed unless there are fixed duties or a substantial equivalent. </para>

                        <para>.- I trust the Minister will agree to a fixed duty on shooks. As the honorable member for Bendigo has explained, shooks are imported principally from India, put together here under the circumstances he described, and sold at about one-fourth of their value in India or London. They are sent here because there is a better chance of getting cheap loading from India to Australia than from India to England, and they have been sold f.o.b. in Calcutta and Bombay as low as  6s. 6d.  f.o.b., whereas the actual value in London is about  30s. </para>

                            <para>- But it is not  100  per cent, on the- actual value of the article. The barrel having been used only once for the transit of beer, whisky or other liquor, is as valuable, or even more valuable, as a seasoned cask than when it was new. Not a single employer has spoken to me on this matter, but the. representatives of the men's unions have seen me, and, as there is a fixed duty on dressed staves, they suggest that there should also be a fixed duty on shooks. If we desire to retain the coopering industry, a fixed duty should certainly be imposed. </para>

                            <para>- Cross-examination would in no way alter my statement. Years ago I used to import shooks, and, calculating the cost of 2s. 6d. for putting the shooks together, with is. for freight and other charges, the actual value is not. above 12s. Further, it is impossible to get more than three good casks out of five sets of shooks. They are used mostly by the manufacturers of dry goods in the various capitals. </para>

                            <para>- They may be, but I know nothing of the beer industry. We have been told that the life of a cask is twenty years, and that may be so; but if the cask is in transit constantly two or three years is about the limit. Beer casks are generally made of strong wood, frequently Australian wood, and are very good. It is absurd to impose a duty of ios. on a second-hand cask which at the very outside is not worth more than 6s. to 8s., and, in my opinion, duties of 35 per cent, and 30 per cent, are quite ample. </para>

                        <para>. - I am altogether puzzled about the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. Those recommendations are based on statements made to them by a conference of delegates of the Victorian Association of Coopers and the Master Coopers' Association, who, according to the Tariff Commission's report, declare that a new hogshead is worth 25s., whereas a shook hogshead is worth 25s. 6d. Can that be right? </para>

                            <para>- I can quite believe that the honorable member had had "quite enough of it." I am making no complaint against the honorable member personally, because we all know with what rare industry he applied himself to the work. What I am pointing out is the one-sided character of the evidence, and its little value. I think the Minister would be quite justified in making these duties uniform at an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate. If the coopering trade cannot stand with a duty of 35 per cent., it is a business which ought to be left to look after itself. Why coopers should be exempt from the ordinary competition of trade, I do not know. The honorable member for Bendigo says that there is a danger of the industry dving out; but there is a price to be paid for everything, and, if the industry dies with protection to the extent of 35 per cent., it will merely prove that there are coopers somewhere else in the world who can do very much better with less protection. The great difficulty presented in all the evidence of the Tariff Commission is that it  is  grossly one-sided ; none of it is corroborated, and, although sworn to, is <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> right through. I intend to move that these duties be omitted, and that a uniform <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate be substituted for them. </para>

                        <para>.- Perhaps the Treasurer would explain why he proposes to increase the duty upon tubs from  20  per cent, to  45-  per cent., and to make buckets which were formerly free dutiable at the same extravagantly high rate? The increase proposed upon this item is  10  per cent, in excess of the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. The Treasurer has inserted the duty recommended by that portion of the Commission in the preference column, and has increased the rate against the . outside world by  10  per cent. I should like some explanation as to the reasons underlying his action. </para>

                        <para>.- The Treasurer has explained that it is owing to the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission that a duty of  35  per cent, has been levied upon buckets and tubs imported from the United Kingdom. But the  Chairman  of the Commission has stated that in recommending such high rates of duty, the A section of that body had in mind the maximum amount of duty. He conveyed the impression to my mind that its members did not intend that the rates which they recommended should prevail against Great Britain, and that a still higher rate should be charged against the outside world. </para>

The  Chairman  of that body distinctly pointed out in this chamber what was the idea underlying his recommendations, and I have quoted his utterances in this connexion upon more than one occasion.

Some of these buckets are exceedingly cheap and are used very largely in fruit-picking. The fruit-pickers constitute the poorest class in the community, and as they have to provide their own buckets, a duty of 45 per cent, is a heavy tax upon them. </para>

                            <para>- In Tasmania a very much higher price is paid for the fruit which is picked in buckets, because it does not pulp the same as it does when picked in tubs. The zinc bucket is unsuitable, because it stains and destroys the fruit in a short time. Wooden buckets are exceedingly cheap, and last about one season. Sometimes a family will have to obtain four or five buckets at a time. The fruit-pickers are the very poorest class in the community. Generally a widow with four of five children will go into the fruit-growing districts, and when . the fruit-picking is done they go hop-picking. </para>

                            <para>- I did not bring the doll, but whoever did so did the right thing. I am in favour of a reduction of the duty on dolls, as they are not made here. I think that the Minister might agree to an alteration of the duty on toys generally. This item also includes articles used for outdoor and indoor games. I believe that those articles include boxing gloves and cricketing gloves and material. As boxing gloves are made here, I think that all articles used for outdoor and indoor games should be put in a separate line, and made subject to a heavy duty. </para>

                        <para>.- There seems to be a good deal of sentiment about this subject, and I- am surprised that honorable members should introduce sentiment into the consideration of a Tariff. One would think that toys were of such a scientific and complicated construction, and so affected by patents, that it was impossible to manufacture them in Australia. I do not see why the toys used by our children should not be made here. Furthermore, I think we are justified in endeavouring to find avenues of employment for women. Toy -making is really women's work. A reasonable duty would not penalize the children by any means. On the cheaper lines a duty would make very little difference. It might fall heavier upon the dearer kinds of toys, but those who could afford to buy expensive toys are well able to pay the extra duty. There is every reason why we should encourage the manufacture of dolls and toys in Australia instead of importing them from Germany. </para>

                        <para>.- I trust that the Treasurer will agree to strike out the word " toys " in the item with a. view to making them duty free. It is bad enough to tax children's clothes and food, without imposing a duty on ' their playthings. Our little ones will hot be children very long. Let us make their youthful lives as pleasant and happy as possible, and let them have as many toys as their parents and friends can buy for them. Let them be as cheap as possible so that the children of the poorer classes may have as generous a share of them as their parents' circumstances will allow. I hope that the Treasurer will yield to the appeal that has been made to him, and will agree to strike out the word " toys." </para>

My reason is that the makers of boxing gloves and cricketing gloves and pads have, under a later item, to pay duties on the raw material they use in the shape of leather. They should be given some protection, to cover the duties they will be called upon to pay on their raw materials. </para>

                        <para>.- This is an outrage. If this item is passed as proposed, I shall be compelled to grow a beard. The people who manufacture shaving pots and soap will suffer, but I will have to suffer also. I should like to impress honorable members with the importance of this question. I recently read an article, I think, in last Saturday's <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> in which reference was made to the great danger of wearing beards. I was going to say that the article was cribbed ; it was an article by a scientific authority that was reproduced in the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> It was stated by the writer that a beard is the most dangerous thing a man can wear, and is dangerous especially to the other sex, since beards gather up and accumulate all kinds of malignant microbes, such as the microbes of' diphtheria, influenza, and other undesirable ailments. </para>

                        <para>.- I have a few samples here of this unfinished jewellery. You, sir, are probably the best judge we have in the chamber of the value of these goods, and if you were not in the chair you would no doubt have something to say about them. The point I wish to make is that  they are practically finished articles. I have 15-carat rings here, which I am informed by experts in the trade, employers as well' as employes, are worth about 10s. each. All that is required to finish them is to put the stones in them, for which they have been prepared, and these stones are sent out  in a separate parcel and admitted free. When the stones .are set in the ring, its value is increased to about <inline font-style="italic">£2,</inline> and this increase in value is brought about with very small expense for labour. We have allowed precious stones to come in free, and under this arrangement of the Tariff a lot of work in the jewellery t -Fade which might be done here will be done elsewhere. I admit that 'I do not know how the difficulty is to be overcome. I have here also a 15- carat brooch practically finished, and requiring only the stones to be set. I have samples also of bracelet fronts in the same stage of manufacture. Goods of this kind, which would be valued at the Custom House at <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> or .a little more, are worth when the stones have been set in them perhaps <inline font-style="italic">£10.</inline> The Minister might consult with the officers to see whether some means might not be discovered to prevent this evasion of the duties on jewellery which every honorable member will admit is a luxury. </para>

                            <para>- Precious stones are admitted duty free, so that when a ring setting and its stone are imported separately, duty is paid only on the setting, and, of course, comes to very much less than if the two were brought in together as a finished article. I trust that if there is any way of preventing this evasion of duty it will be taken. If the Minister cannot suggest an amendment now, will he look into the matter, and subsequently issue a regulation which will get over the difficulty? </para>

                        <para>Unfinished jewellery generally consists of settings and mounts for bracelets, brooches, necklets, and rings, which are made up and imported apart from their precious stones. The manufacturing jewellers, as well as the workers in Victoria, suggested that there should be a higher duty on such jewellery than on complete jewellery. They believe that such a higher duty would tend to reduce the importations of these unfinished settings and mounts, and that it would encourage their manufacture in Australia.. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is a grievance with manufacturing jeweller* and jewellers' workers that practically finished articles can be imported on the payment of an extremely small duty by placing the fittings or mounts in one parcel and the gems in another. This is really a fraud on the revenue which the Customs authorities have found themselves unable tu prevent. I have consulted the highest Customs authorities in Australia, with reference to the matter, and they can suggest no better way of dealing with it than that proposed. </para>

                        <para>. - It seems to me that the higher the rates of duty in this item, the less the likelihood of the fraud to which reference has been made being practised. The honorable member for Parramatta cannot cloud the issue. The -fact is that practically finished jewellery is brought in at a low rate by separating the settings and the stones to make it dutiable as unfinished jewellery. As a matter of fact, it is so much finished that any one could put it together, could set it and finish it, with a penknife, making it a marketable commodity at once. I hope that Hie Treasurer will make the duty  50  per cent. </para>

                        <para>. -At first the proposed duty seemed to me very high, but there is a great deal in the contention of the honorable member for  Yarra. Jewellery is dutiable under item  334  at  30  and  25  per cent, but if a setting and its stones are brought in separately, and  40  per cent, is charged on the setting, while the stones are admitted free, the amount actually paid is very much smaller than would be paid on the finished article, though what is imported is virtually a finished article. For instance, a setting might be worth  10s.,  and the stones belonging to it might be worth  30s.  If the article were imported as finished jewellery, it would be dutiable at  30  per cent., whereas if the setting and the stones were imported separately, duty would be levied only on the setting, at the rate of  40  per cent., making the amount actually paid on the complete article only a fraction of that. A duty which permits an importation of this kind does not give valid and effective protection. Something must be done to prevent all but the least valuable part of an article coming in duty free. It seems to me that unless a very high duty is placed on settings, it will be necessary to impose a duty on precious stones. </para>

It has come to the conclusion that the only way is to put a high duty on this partially-finished imported jewellery. </para>

                            <para>- One of its essential functions is to protect other parts of the Tariff. I am surprised that some honorable members ask for a duty of  50  per cent. I do not feel disposed to move for higher rates than  40  per cent, and  35  per cent, at present. That is the recommendation of the A section of the Tariff Commission. Previously the duty was  25  per cent. If the honorable member for Parramatta will withdraw his amendment, I desire to alter the wording of the item to read as follows - " Jewellery, unfinished, being settings and mounts for bracelets, brooches, necklets and rings, unset, or set with imitation stones." Setting with imitation stones is another method adopted of avoiding the higher duty. The jewellery is imported, in that way at the lower rate, the imitation stones are taken out, and more valuable stones are put in afterwards. </para>

                        <para>.- Those protectionists who did not hesitate about imposing taxes of from  25  per cent, to  150  per cent, on food and clothing might be pardoned for regarding even.  40  per cent, or  50  per cent, as a very moderate duty on jewellery, but I shall be very glad to see the duties on these items reduced. I do not believe in taxes of any kind on either the necessaries or luxuries of life. As I have tried to get all taxes reduced on food and clothing and other necessaries, I shall be quite consistent in seeking to have them reduced also on what are called luxuries, but what I regard as part of the necessaries of life. I am sorry the honorable member for Parramatta has withdrawn his amendment, as I should have liked an opportunity of voting for it. </para>

                        <para>. - I  think the Treasurer is a bit at sea in regard to 9-carat jewellery. He must remember that when he was Minister of Trade and Customs he instituted a prosecution against a Melbourne firm for importing rings which were stamped 9-carat, but which were wrongly described, and were neither more nor less than a fraud. Any day rings may be bought which are stamped " 9-carat," but which in reality are not even  6-carat  gold. </para>

                        <para>.- This "machine made chain in the rough" is practically finished jewellery. It is imported in one long chain, and cut into the required lengths here ; and I think that, in order to protect the revenue, it ought to be placed in the next item. On the other hand, gallerie and beads are among the raw materials of jewellery, and ought to be made free. I suggest that the words " machine made chain in the rough " be omitted. </para>

In many parts of Australia, and! particularly Queensland and New South Wales, there are opal fields and sapphire mines; and I do not see why the duties should be only 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, when men have to work night and day in order to make a living in the mining of these precious stones. </para>

                        <para>.- It seems to me that it would be very absurd to impose a duty of 35 per cent, upon imitation precious stones, the invoiced value of which would be very small indeed. In this country we produce rubies in such quantity that we have been obliged to call them garnets to prevent the price of rubies being reduced to a non-payable level. Yet it is now proposed to admit coloured glass at . 30 and 25 per cent. We should either prohibit its importation' entirely, or levy a specific duty upon this class of jewellery of so much per carat. The Treasurer knows perfectly well that the Commonwealth produces a large variety of precious stones, and that the industry is one upon which a man may embark without the possession of either capital or skill. Opals, rubies, and garnets can be obtained here by the veriest new chum, who ought to be protected just as much as anybody else. </para>

                        <para>.- The Tariff Commission is in no way responsible for the inclusion of imitation precious stones in this item. As a matter of fact, this group of items was intended' to cover Only <inline font-style="italic">bond -fide</inline> jewellery. For that reason, rolled gold jewellery and jeweller)' under 9 carat were taken out of it, and the Commission recommended that they should be made dutiable at 35 per cent. My own idea is that imitation stones should be removed from this item and charged a special rate. </para>

                        (New England) [9-41- I" hope that the Treasurer will agree to eliminate imitation precious stones from this item. I am rather disappointed that the Tariff schedule makes no attempt to protect Australian diamonds. In. my own electorate, we have fields which are producing thousands of pounds worth of diamonds annually. For many years these precious stones were sold as Brazilian diamonds, "but now they are being sold as Australian diamonds, and even the smallest of them - if they are usable - are worth 22s. 6d. per carat. These fields have produced diamonds worth as much as

                        each in the rough. I think that we should eliminate imitation precious stones from the item under consideration with a view to prevent glass jewellery from being imported to compete with the genuine article. The only way in which we can attain our object is by the imposition of a heavy duty per carat upon precious stones. The industry is one in which tens of thousands of pounds have been invested, and there are miles and miles of country how awaiting development. Under these circumstances, I think that the industry ought to be protected.

                        <para>.- In the previous item, we have taxed rolled gold jewellery at 40 per cent, under the General Tariff and at 35 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Yet it 1s now proposed to make jewellery and imitation jewellery n.e.i. dutiable at only 30 per cent, under the General Tariff and at 25 per cent, under that for Great Britain. I agree with the honorable member for Oxley that the duties upon the two items should be made uniform. </para>

The honorable gentleman has told me that a working jeweller has confided to some other person that this duty is all right. But I submit that this question has nothing whatever to do with the working jeweller. It has solely to do with those who produce rubies, garnets, sapphires, &amp;c, from our mines. It is not a question of the Australian diamond having to compete with the foreign diamond, but of the Australian precious stone having to compete with glass and imitation jewellery. We must recollect that whilst it would pay a man to smuggle diamonds, it would not pay him to bring in a load of glass worth only about 4½d. per oz. If the Treasurer will agree to the imposition of a specific duty upon this item, that will be sufficient. </para>

                            <para>- Whatever duty we may impose will have no effect whatever, because the price of precious stones in the Commonwealth is regulated by the London market. If precious stones are dearer here than they are in London, our supplies will come from London. But if a. certain price can be realized for our stones upon the London market, the vendors will expect  to obtain very nearly the same price for them here. It by imposing a heavy duty upon imitation precious stones we could cause an in creased demand for the real - which is very doubtful - that increased demand would be so small that it would not affect the markets of the world. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for North Sydney appears to think that the value of precious stones is determined by some factor other than that which determines the value of all our commodities. As a matter of fact, the price of every bushel of wheat grown in Australia is regulated by the price of wheat in London. In the same way, the price of boots here is determined by their price in London, New York, and Berlin, and by nothing else. The honorable gentleman seems to think that the value of imitation jewellery is a matter of a few pence. But he can go down town and see  a good paste diamond worth  £5  or <inline font-style="italic">£6,</inline> independent of its setting. </para>

                            <para>- That statement is quite true. Does not the honorable member know that Australian garnets can be produced and sold by the bucket ? He does not know anything about them. Therefore these articles do compete with the better grade imitation jewels. If we put a reasonable duty on imitation jewels we shall reduce the difference between Australian precious stones and imitation stones, and it will lead people to buy the former. </para>

                        <para>.- I protest that this arrangement will not have the effect of bringing info use the cheaper precious stones. A duty of  40  per cent. on imitation precious stones amounts to practically nothing, as they are worth only a few pence each. But if they were subjected to a duty of so much per carat it would prohibit their importation to a great extent and force into use the smaller diamonds, garnets, sapphires, rubies and so forth which we can produce, and which are of a fairly low value. I consider that if a definite attempt were made to bring into use our cheaper precious stones it might induce a cutter to set up an establishment in Australia. One of the greatest troubles to the miner who has precious stones is that there is no local buyer. They have all to be sent to the London or German market to be cut, and then they are returned to Australia. I believe that an almost prohibitive duty on imitation precious stones would lead to a decided increase in the use of our lower-priced precious stones. </para>

                        <para>. - In this item we are asked to give to British imports a preference of  10  per cent, as against cheap Swiss watches. I am told that there is no serious competition between Swiss and British watches, and that this duty will be a heavy tax on the poorer classes. In my opinion we ought to make the preference a little less than is proposed. Therefore, with a view to allowing the  20  per cent, in the preferential column to stand, I move - </para>

William Ehrhardt Limited, of Birmingham, the Lancashire Watch Company. Limited, of Prescot, Henry Williamson, "of London, and Rotherham and Sons, of Coventry, have written long letters in which they approve of the action of the Parliament, and thank the Government for proposing this preference to British watches. </para>

                        <para>. - I went to Rotherham and Sons to get a gold watch which had been presented to me many years before, and which bore the name of that firm, made into a stem-winding watch, but I found that they had only a fitting establishment in England, and that the bulk of the works of their watches were made in Switzerland. It has only been within the last two or three years that any large firms for the making of cheap watches for the multitude have been established in Great Britain. This duty will have the effect of raising the value of cheap watches  by  two or three shillings each. A watch that will keep good time for many years can- be bought in London at from 3s. to 5s. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know, why the preference has been made so much in this case end only 5 per cent. in other cases. It has gone forth to the world that we were giving a particular preference, and no doubt some of the British firms have based their calculations thereon. Unless there is strong reason for departing from it, it seems to me that it would be wiser not to do so. </para>

                            <para>- In some cases we have wiped out the preference, but that,  I think, was done because the opposing sides were really fighting as to the amount of the general duty. I think that, as far as possible, we ought to maintain the preference which British people have been led to understand was being offered to them. Of course, the Committee is not responsible for the offer of the Government, but if it goes back upon that offer it will not produce the most favorable impression in the Old Country. We ought not to depart from the offer except in special circumstances </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to reply to the honorable member for Grampians in reference to the Rotherham Watch Company. I think he has been misinformed. I am told that every particle of the watches turned out by the Rotherham Company are made in Coventry. For that reason alone, I think that we should give a preference against the American watches. The English companies are now putting up expensive machinery to enable them to compete against the American watch trade. As the honorable member for Parramatta is constantly vaunting his desire for preference to the Mother Country, I appeal to him to agree to a preference of 10 per cent. in favour of English manufacturers in this line. </para>

I had the greatest difficulty, when I was in London, in finding their establishment. I discovered it after great trouble, and I asked them whether they could convert my watch into a stem- winding watch. They said they could, but that it would take them a little while. I asked them how long, and they said a month or six weeks. They could not do it in less time, because they had to get some of their parts from, or send it to, Switzerland. </para>

                        <para>I am writing on behalf of my firm - the watch manufacturing firm of Rotherham and Sons - to express a wish that we may record how much we appreciate the sympathy of your Government in granting a preferential Tariff which extends to English watches ; and I may add that this is also appreciated by our work people to an extent that could not have existed a few years ago. We hope that in the best interests of English manufacture, watches to gain the preference will have to be certified as English, both in movement and case, as there is a tendency amongst some makers of cheap goods to use foreign cases, a proceeding that is quite unnecessary. </para>

                            <para>- I apprehend that very little argument will be required to recommend my amendment to the CommitteeThe object is, of course, to put talking machines, including gramophones, graphophones, and phonographs on the free list. The phonograph is now largely used in commerce. I need not explain its operation. Seeing that these goods cannot be manufactured in Australia ' under present circumstances, the advisableness of not imposing a duty on them should be obvious.. The Treasurer must be perfectly aware,, also, that it is impossible to produce the records in Australia, because the artists whose songs and music it is desired to be produced live for the most part at the other side of the world. Even supposing that" these goods were manufactured -in Australia, it would be necessary to pay a royalty on them, because the instruments are the subject of patents. I do not think that I need elaborate the point, but if the Committee wish I will enter into arguments in support of the contentions fully stated in the petition presented to the House from those engaged in the trade. </para>

                            <para>- That is the item under which they would come. I am glad to notice that common steel-rimmed spectacles are rapidly falling into disuse, and that even men and women in humble circumstances who need glasses are using superior spectacles with either gold or silver frames. Spectacles are not a luxury, and we should endeavour to make them available at a cheap rate. The people of Australia are recognising more than ever the necessity for carefully protecting the sight, and I think that good glasses should be brought within the reach of the poorest people in the community. </para>

                            <para>- They are not made here. About four years ago Messrs. W. Wood and Company, of Howey-street, Melbourne, brought out two expert gold frame spectacle makers under a two years', contract, which provided that they should each receive a salary of <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> per week. It was found, however, that it would be impossible to carry on the industry of making gold spectacle frames in Australia, unless with the assistance, of a duty of about 200 per cent. Four-dwt. spectacle frames, which can be. imported for 15s., cost <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 14s. 4d. to produce here, and as the result of this experience, one of the experts returned to England after his period .of service, had expired, and the other is now carrying on a small repairing business in  Melbourne. Most of these frames are imported 'from Germany, America, and France,' and can be obtained there so cheaply that, as I have said, a duty of about 200 per cent, would be necessary to enable the industry to be successfully carried on in Australia. Under the Victorian Tariff gold-rimmed and silver-rimmed spectacles of all kinds were free, an attempt under an earlier Tariff to encourage the industry having failed. </para>

                        <para>The preference in favour of the United Kingdom is an absolute farce. If it were raised to 20 per cent, it would not be effective in any of the lines mentioned. The Americans and Germans have succeeded in turning out superior goods at a much lower rate, and in the cheaper class of spectacles the Britisher does not attempt to compete, and I very much doubt whether a 50 per cent, preference would induce him to enter into competition. </para>

                        <para>There are in Sydney, as far as I can trace, three very small manufacturers employing only a few hands. In Melbourne there are four unimportant manufacturers. Under the old Tariff these makers complained .they could not make it pay to manufacture, and under the new Tariff none of them have extended their factories, nor do they employ more hands. As a fact, it is within my knowledge that hands for this class of work are not to be got. In the first place, they require female machinists,  and there is a dearth of that class of labour in the market, as not only the shoe trade but all other trades complain they cannot get sufficient labour of this class to carry on. Then, where male labour is employed men will not do the work, as it is too small, and, consequently, it will develop into a trade for women and boys if that class of labour can be obtained. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Parramatta has shown that there is no good reason for increasing the duties on boots and shoes. Manufacturers have prospered under the old rates, the importations of boots and shoes being exceedingly small in comparison with the total number used in the Commonwealth. The bootmaking industry is not a new one. It is now settled on a firm basis. Therefore the proposal to reimpose the old rates will, I suppose, have the support of the Labour Party. Honorable members know very well that children who go barefooted to school are looked down upon by their fellows. </para>

Not long ago, when the New South Wales elections were on, the members of the Labour Party said that they would vote against any increase of duties on the necessaries of life, and surely in a country like this, boots and shoes are among the necessaries of life. The proposed increase should be voted against by all honorable members, no matter what their fiscal opinions. </para>

The children of rich and poor alike will not wear boots to school if they can avoid doing so. I could always afford to supply my youngsters with boots, but they used to plant them in the bush on their way to school, and then some one would come along and shake them.

                            <para>- I am talking about the subtropical districts. The honorable member knows nothing about any place outside the Hunter electorate. If he travelled more, he would not be as one-eyed as some of the Victorian protectionists. At Mungundi, on the New South Wales border, a few hundred miles north of Maitland, I have seen children going to school barefooted. The stock in Western Queensland are not degenerating, even though the youngsters do not wear boots when going to school. They are equal to sample. I have lived there thirty years, and am not, I think, a bad sample. The honorable member for Moreton is another good type of Queenslander, and I think he would corroborate my statement that youngsters go to school in that State barefooted, and are not looked down upon on that account. . In the circumstances, the honorable member for Hunter, in pleading for the youngsters who have to go to school barefooted, is barking up the wrong tree. </para>

                            <para>- They had five. The increase in the number of hands in another factory has been over  100  per) cent. More than that, they have reduced the price of children's boots. The honorable member for Hunter spoke of children having to go to school without boots. The price of sizes  4  to  6  of boots such as these I have here were sold under the old Tariff at  is. 8d.  per pair, and we have reduced the price to 1s.  6d.  per pair. . These boots are made of Australian leather, under Australian conditions, and are competing successfully against the products of sweated labour in other countries, where the employes have to work every day in the week, in some cases, including Sundays. We pay in this industry  25s.  a week to a girl who would get only  8s.  or  9s.  a week in the Old Country. Yet we have reduced the price under the present protective Tariff to the extent of  2d.  per pair in these small sizes. Why, then, should the duty be taken off? </para>

                            <para>- I challenge the honorable member to examine the boots I have here. If he compares them with imported' boots, he will find them superior. When the honorable member talks about brown paper, let me tell him that only a short time ago a gentleman waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs to ask him to allow infants' boots to come in at a low rate because the insoles were made of cardboard. I was approached in connexion with the matter, and refused to have anything to do with it. The Australian-made boots I have here are made entirely of leather. The duty should be maintained,  and, as a result, a number of men and girls will receive employment. There is no justification for a reduction of the duty, and the honorable member for Parramatta has not given a single reason why it should be reduced, whilst I have shown that under the present protection the prices of these boots have been reduced. In every line the prices of these sizes have been reduced in some cases by1d. per pair and in others by  2d.  per pair. The price charged for one line of these boots is  17s.  per dozen, whilst the imported price for the same article is  18s.  per dozen. The price for another line is11s. per dozen, and the imported price  12s.,  and in connexion with another line I have here the price, as I have already said, has been reduced from1s.  8d.  to1s.  6d.  per pair. The honorable member for Parramatta comes from a State where those engaged in this industry have asked for the highest protection. They have asked for a duty of as high as  50  per cent. If I did not advocate the claim of New South Wales manufacturers when they ask for an increased duty, I should be told that as it was not a Victorian industry, I would not stand up for it. That is one of the reasons why I have stood up for it tonight. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Batman is like a travelling pedlar. First of all he brings a china cup into the chamber and flourishes it before the eyes of honorable members. Now he is hawking babies' boots about. I wonder  Where  the honorable member picks these things up. He seems to be a veritable depository of all the nicks and nacks. to be found in Australia. I am sure he must feel the responsibility of his position very keenly. He feels, no doubt, that he is the embodiment of the protectionist sentiment of Australia, and that he is performing a very solemn and sacred duty. </para>

I prefer to give the. reasons of a man who is the  chairman  of a' great association in New South Wales, and who has been in this business all his life. Of course, he does not know half as much about the subject as does the honorable member for Batman, who, I suppose, has never worked in a boot shop in his life, and therefore knows all about it. </para>

                        <para>Then, as to felt slippers, there is only a rise of 5 per cent., but this duty should be reduced as low as possible as these are the cheap goods that are made in Lancashire by non-sweated labour, made next to the mills where the material is manufactured. This class of work it would be impossible to make in this country, the material not being available nor the labour. </para>
                        <para>Another point I wish to put before you. In taxing these lines of infants' shoes and slippers you are taxing the little children and the working classes, as the goods that are imported are for labouring people in nearly all cases, and adding the duty on the imported price simply means adding considerably to the price of the article for the working man. </para>

We ask only for a small reduction of the duty, and only a small increase has been proposed by the Treasurer ; but I have quoted an authoritative statement that an increase in duty will do no good to the manufacturers - they do not want it, as they had a virtual monopoly of the Australian market under the old duties - but will simply make boots dearer to the public. We ought, therefore, to let well alone. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Batman exhibited a pair of boots which he said were made in Australia, after stating that if the imported boots were examined it would be found that they were composed partly of paper. I have taken the trouble to examine very carefully the boots exhibited by the honorable member, and out of one small boot I have taken quite a handful of paper. On the surface there is a material which is made to imitate the finest white kid. but which after all is only paper. Below that again I find paper with printing on if - something about a company and a catalogue - and then again layer after layer of paper, and vet the honorable member for Batman says that. those boots are made entirely of leather. </para>

I quoted just now, when only a few members were in the chamber, a' letter from the  Chairman  of the Association of Manufacturers of Boots and Shoes, pointing out that no infants' boots are being made in Australia. The only exception is that related by the honorable member for Batman, who has found in Melbourne a factory . employing five hands. In order to protect an industry employing five hands in Melbourne, it is proposed to tax all the infants' boots and shoes throughout the Commonwealth. I say that this is protection run stark mad. </para>

                        <para>. - I would suggest that an all-round duty should be imposed upon footwear. That was the. principal request urged by those interested in the boot industry who appeared before the Tariff Commission. No differentiation should be made in favour of infants' boots and shoes, which are made of the poorest material. As a matter of fact, these boots are sold at from 6d. to 7d. per pair, and a duty of 30 per cent, upon such goods would not amount to much. </para>

These are all surgical articles which are used by invalids and sick persons, and which  I  venture to suggest ought not to be taxed. Hospital furniture has been allowed to come in at a lesser rate than other furniture, and these  articles may fairly be described as hospital furniture. </para>

I know from experience that elastic stockings,, leggings, thigh pieces, and wristlets of excellent quality and low price are being; locally made. What is proposed is simply an increase of 5 per cent, over the old duty. I have had reason to purchase some of these goods for my own patients lately, and I found that the price was much less than I had to pay some years ago. </para>

I point out that these letters are not of the character of those with which we have been deluged during: the past few weeks. They were sent in reply to inquiries made by me, because I wished to inform myself on the subject. The writers did not approach me in the first instance ; I approached them. Consequently, I place more value upon them than I do upon letters such as have been sent to every member of Parliament. One of the leading firms of surgical instrument dealers, Messrs. Denver Brothers, Melbourne, write to me - </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members must not forget that there is a very small sale for articles of this description. They are not bought as we buy boots and clothing: The demand being limited, they are naturally expensive. It would not pay any one to set up a large factory for the manufacture of such articles. As the output is so small, of necessity the dealers are compelled to import them. Take the case of elastic stockings and knee caps. We know that they are articles which must of necessity be of good quality, or they are absolutely useless. The man who buys elastic stockings which are not well made, and of the best material, might as well throw his money into the sea. </para>

Since the firms which import them charge exorbitant prices - prices out of all proportion to their initial cost -  I  do not feel inclined .to help them in this matter.  I  have it on good authority that rubber manufacturers in the Commonwealth, whom we have assisted very materially by the imposition of protective duties, have taken up a class of manufacture which has taken the place of certain importations which have been stopped at the Customs House. Certain goods of an illicit character, which are sold by chemists and other dealers for purposes which Australia at all events should endeavour as far as possible to minimize, are now being manufactured by rubber-makers in the Commonwealth. A great deal has been done by the Customs Department to prevent the importation of such goods, and  I  am very grieved to find that manufacturers whom we have protected are now taking up their production. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Laanecoorie has spoken about the excessive cost of these articles, and yet wishes the Committee to impose a duty which will practically establish a local monopoly enabling makers to still further increase their. charges. The best way to prevent overcharging is to create the freest competition. If there is any force in the arguments of the honorable member for Laanecoorie, these goods should be on the free list. </para>

                            <para>- They are cheaper everywhere now, because of the reduced price of rubber. I know that honorable members are anxious to get through with the Tariff. We could finish in a night if we let the Treasurer' and his supporters have their way ; but I am not prepared to do that. I am pledged to my constituents to try to secure the reduction of duties, and I shall do what I can to carry out my promise. </para>

If we have in the preference column a duty equal to that imposed under the old Tariff, and under the General Tariff impose a duty in accordance with the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, that should satisfy the Treasurer. The insurance and other import charges added to the duties I propose should provide ample protection for the local producers of these goods. </para>

                        <para>.- I think that I should here move the insertion of a new paragraph to cover air and water beds,, air cushions and pillows, and surgical tubing. If they are not dealt with separately, they will be dutiable under rubber manufactures n.e.i. I do not care what course is adopted, so long as they are specially mentioned and admitted free. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to remind the Treasurer that hard rubber in sheets is largely manufactured here, and I think that it is a mistake to include it in this item. I see no reason why hard rubber sheets should be admitted free. The Opposition are most persistent when they want anything, but if any one else makes a proposal they are up in arms at once. It is a good job that they are not in a majority. </para>

                            <para>- Simply because somebody in the industry whispers a request, the Treasurer immediately asks the Committee to accept an amendment of this kind. I refuse to be a party to this sort of legislation. We are supposed to be a deliberative body ; and yet what are we asked to do? The Treasurer, whilst expressing anxiety to deal with these items as they appear in the schedule, has the temerity at the very last moment to submit absolutely new proposals. I should like to know what the proposed duty of 2d. per square foot means from an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> stand-point. </para>

Since then fresh information has become available, from which it appears that there is a deficiency in certain classes of leather in Australia, such as kid, patent, and enamel leather, which are used for uppers in certain kinds of boots. There is also a deficiency in calf leathers known as white sheep and lamb leather. </para>

                            <para>- Tn slight quantities, I understand that - it is being made in Richmond, Melbourne. Since the report of the A section of the Tariff Commission was drawn up the manufacturers of Victoria and South Australia have met in conference, and, in conjunction with the kid tanners, have waited as a deputation upon the Minister of Trade and Customs. Upon the 22nd August last, they urged that the duty upon calf should be reduced to 15 .per cent., and that 2d. per square foot should be levied upon kid leathers. I have been informed that the manufacturers and tanners in all the States concur in this proposition, and I fail to see why such a howl of indignation should emanate from . the free-trade members of the Committee, when a request is made to reduce the duties levied upon their raw materials. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not mind admitting that the proposal of the honorable member for Bendigo came as a positive shock to me. I cannot yet realize that the Chairman of the Tariff Commission has actually proposed a reduction of the duty upon the articles enumerated in paragraph  a.  I hope that it will be chronicled in our history, and that 100 years hence people will recollect that on the 7 th December, 1907, the honorable member proposed a reduction in a dutv. Does the honorable member for Batman concur in this proposal? Will the Sphinx speak? It is of no use for the honorable member for Bendigo to make these proposals unless the honorable member for Batman concurs in them. </para>

                        <para>.I remind honorable members that the agriculturists who supply the skins need protection as well as any one else. I have received a copy of the circular from the bootmakers and tanners, who, I venture to think, are wonderfully kind persons. They suggest certain duties, and point put that it is not necessary to give any preference to Great Britain because the leathers which come from that country are only used by the bookbinders and upholsterers. Practically they say that they are not affected by those duties, and that therefore it is not necessary to give a preference to Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>. - In view of the fact that the Minister proposes to considerably reduce the duties on the raw material of the boot manufacturers, I should like to know whether he intends to re-commit the items relating to boots so that we may re-consider our decision with regard to them. My complaint against the honorable member for Bendigo . is that, although he had in his mind at the time a reduction of these duties, he as  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission pressed for high duties upon boots, giving us no information that these reductions were contemplated. Had the Committee known that such a reduction was to be proposed the vote on the boot items might have been different. In this case as in others the Treasurer at the last moment has sprung new proposals upon the Committee, and we have no opportunity to consider what their effect may be. I protest against such tactics. The boot manufacturers have the protection of high duties, and they should be prepared to do something for the tanners. </para>

                            <para>- The tanners are willing to buy all the kid skins that can be produced here. The amendment moved by the Treasurer carries out proposals agreed to bv a combined deputation of manufacturers and master tanners, representing practically all parts of the Commonwealth, which waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs. The union operatives on the Wages Board were told that the employers could not pay higher wages because they had agreed to these reductions. As a matter of fact these are slightly lower duties than were originally proposed by the Government. The employers object to a preference being granted because the leather is not produced in England. I propose to refer briefly to the question of chamois leather gloves. </para>

                        <para>. - I would urge the Treasurer to grant a slight preference to British imports. The difficulty under which tanners in Queensland labour is that the Japanese buy up the local hides and skins, and carry them off to Japan to be tanned. </para>

                            <para>- I was asked to urge  the imposition of an export duty, but do not favour such a proposition. I appeal to the Treasurer to make the duties 30 per cent, and 20 per cent. I have some sympathy for the tanner as well as for the boot manufacturer, and I trust that my request will be acceded to. </para>
