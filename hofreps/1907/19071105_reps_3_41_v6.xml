                        <para>- The inquiry is rather early. I hope that we shall have dealt with the Tariff at least a week before Christmas, and shall then be able to adjourn over the month of January, reassembling as early in February as honorable members, after considering the question between then and now, may feel convenient. </para>

                            <para>- The Government have considered several proposals for expediting business. The honorable member has been no sinner in the matter of &#39;making long speeches, but he had the long discipline of the Tariff Commission. If that result of its meetings could have been-&#39; foreseen, there would have been an inclination to appoint every member to the Commission. </para>

                            <para>- Does the Prime Minister think a week long enough to enable honorable members who reside in distant States to reach their homes? In 1901, when the last Tariff was under discussion,&#39; we adjourned from the 13th December to the 14th January following ; but, at our present rate of progress, we shall not be so far advanced this December with the present Tariff as we were in. December, 1901; with the Kingston Tariff. When the Prime Minister is taking into consideration the question of adjournment, I wish him not to forget the position of honorable members whose homes are in distant States. </para>

On page 460, the author summarizes the conclusions to be drawn from the evidence obtained by analyses, &#38;c, as to the disadvantages and injurious results following upon the use of the proprietary foods for infants then before the public. On pages 461-5 is given the compo.sition of infants&#39; foods as disclosed by fresh examinations by the author, together with a &#34; General description and remarks,&#34; by the author upon the analyses. On page 535 and following pages, the author treats upon &#34; Artificial and Pre-digested Foods and Artificial Feeding,&#34; and shows that &#34; invalids&#39; &#34; foods are only of use as additions to ordinary food, provided they make up any deficiency in the ordinary food. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris</inline> states that the public are victimized to a large extent by certain invalids&#39; foods, and also by certain infants&#39; foods. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that it is- necessary to detain the Committee,  but in the work which I have just quoted, and which has been lent by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.. Nords,</inline> there are numerous instances given where the importation of food of this kind&#39; should be restricted as much as possible. I quite admit that there is a&#39; great deal in the statement made by the honorable member in reference to the prohibition of these foods, or to having them more clearly defined than they have been. We cannot do everything at once. The Minister of Trade and Customs tells me that in  view of what has taken place - and the persistency of some honorable members has had a good deal to do with it, perhaps, though it has been the intention of the Government to act since last year - a measure will be laid upon the table in about, &#39;or perhaps less than, a week, and then the matter can be dealt with. There is no necessity to exempt these foods at the present time. We propose an increase of duty, which certainly will not do any harm, and may do a great deal of good by preventing the wholesale importation which is now taking place. I think that it would be unwise to exempt all these foods. I have no statement in writing on the subject, but I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris</inline> has said also that they are not equivalent to the ordinary milk that we can produce in Australia, and therefore it would be unwise to allow them to come in indiscriminately._ </para>

I have already told the Committee what I am prepared to do with regard to the Tariff, and I intend to stand by what I have said absolutely. I made a speech declaring my intentions at least a fortnight before the New South Wales State elections.. I am not going any further than I then said. We intend to endeavour to get in free all the infants&#39; foods that are approved. That is a reasonable condition. If the honorable member were anxious to do a fair thing by the Tariff, he would be prepared to agree to an arrangement on that basis, rather than take up an extreme position in support of which there is not the slightest hope of securing a vote from the Committee. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to inquire how the Minister expects the Department to carry out the conditions required by his amendment. The Department of Trade and Customs cannot reasonably be expected to discharge all the duties that are sought to be thrown upon it. I believe that it is the intention of the Minister to introduce a Pure Foods Bill.. Surely this is a matter which can be dealt with under such a measure more effectively than under the Tariff. The particular duty proposed will not affect my vote on the question. I am well aware that a considerable quantity of the foods at present put upon the market ought to be prohibited. They are simply chemical productions, and not foods in the true sense of the word. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale&#39;s</inline> report does not go exhaustively into this matter, but states that he has information at hand with regard to foods the publication of which will be beneficial to the Commonwealth. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> intends to publish the results of his investigations, the Minister would be well advised in letting the matter stand over for a while. Whether these so-called foods are locally made or imported, they should not be permitted to go into consumption if they are pernicious,. It appears to me that the Customs authorities are not sufficiently armed with means to carry out this provision effectively. Too much is being placed on the shoulders of the Customs officers. It has to be remembered  that they have not the. machinery of a Health Department at their command, and, if we take the course proposed, the Minister may not be able to fall back upon the Health Departments of the States- </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that honorable members opposite will not object to the amendment. The Bill to which reference has been made by the honorable member for Dalley can prohibit certain of these importations, and if the amendment is not adopted, then the foods to which it refers cannot be allowed in free. Hitherto the Customs authorities have been in the habit of consulting, and will continue to consult, the officers of the Board of Health of the various States. At present there is no Commonwealth Board of Health, and I am not sure that there will be one under the Quarantine  Bill  ; and, therefore, this matter is likely to remain within the jurisdiction of the Boards of Health of the States. In Victoria, for instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris,</inline> the  Chairman  of the Board of Health, is anxious to assist ; and the same ma.y be said of the Board of Health in New South Wales. We shall be just in the same position as though we had our own Board of Health, though, of course, there must be some head authority. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it is intended to introduce a Bill under that name. In any case, a Bill passed by the Federal Parliament can only affect imports. The honorable member for Dalley knows that many questions have been asked on this subject by the honorable member for Barrier, who is anxious that the Act passed last year shall be carried into effect. Under that Act, it is provided that all imported foods shall bear upon their coverings information as to the materials of which they are composed ; and I think that any future legislation may go further and give the power of prohibition. Such new legislation, however, will not be called a Pure Foods Bill, but will be on the lines of the legislation which has already been carried. </para>

                        <para>.- I think that the proposal of the Treasurer will meet the case. If brands of food are admitted free under departmental by-law, we may be sure that people will not be slow to take advantage of the fact, and that the effect will be better than that of a remission of. the duty. People who are compelled to buy such food will regard their free admission as a guarantee of purity. </para>

                        <para>- - f wish I could think that human credulity is such as the honorable member imagines. Our experience of human nature is that if goods of the kind be cheap people will run all sorts of risks in using them. There would be the greatest difficulty in the world in persuading some. people that certain infants&#39; foods are impure, notwithstanding what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> or the Customs medical authority may say. I do not think that we&#39; ought to tinker about a matter of this sort, which is certainly one for regulation by the health authorities. It &#34;would not appear that by the proposal before us we should add &#39;to the precautions that ought to be taken, or that the difference of 15 per cent, will materially affect the consumption. If an article is cheap, and, therefore, free, it will continue to find its way into use. </para>

                            <para>- I think such foods ought to be prohibited, but there are ways, other than by means of a Tariff, of ascertaining what is ,:pure and what is not. I can understand the Customs Department deciding as to values for duty purposes, but the responsibility of deciding what are pure foods involves a function which a Customs laboratory could not perform and which, as the Treasurer has admitted, must be performed by the States. Why not leave the matter to the States? Why not leave the States to pass Pure Foods Bills and perform the proper policing in this connexion? The proposal appears to me to be dividing responsibility, and I am afraid the result will be that the work will not be so well done as it would if left to one authority. </para>

                        <para>.- Invalids&#39; foods ought to be included in the proposed new item. The Government will be safeguarded by their power to define the foods by regulation. By that means they can so limit the exemption as not to include the injurious articles which have been mentioned. Benger&#39;s foods are used for invalids as well as for infants. I suppose that some invalids in Australia are practically living on foods of that kind &#39;at present. It would be a serious matter to exclude, or even put a duty on, what are really invalids&#39; foods. They should be obtainable as cheaply as. .possible. I shall support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Lang. </para>

                        <para>. - It is not quite a legitimate use of the Tariff to endeavour by it to secure the purity of foods. For -that purpose other legislation is desirable and necessary. If we include invalids&#39; foods in the proposed new item, it will be very difficult to define where it begins and where it ends. Benger&#39;s food is used both for infants and Invalids, and therefore would necessarily be included in the Minister&#39;s proposal. Those honorable members who are asking for the inclusion of invalids&#39; foods are already accomplishing a great deal by the Minister&#39;s proposal, inasmuch as many children&#39;s foods can be, and are, used for invalids. The Minister has made a reasonable concession, and it is not desirable to press the amendment. </para>

                    <para class="block">A few weeks ago we made provision in the Bounties Bill to grant a bounty on the growing of rice hi Australia. This item can only be a revenue-producing one until an appreciable quantity of &#34;rice is grown in -the Com&#39;monwealth. That is not the case, at present. I object to revenue being collected upon an article of this description - an article which is an absolute necessity to a large portion of our population. I voted in favour of the Bounties Bill under a misapprehension. The Government led me to believe that the proposal to grant a bounty upon the production of rice was a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> one, and I understood that it was submitted in lieu of a protective duty. But it now appears that, having induced Parliament to agree to the Bounties Bill, they wish to impose a duty upon rice which cannot have a protective incidence, and which will be merely revenue producing. To raise about ,&#163;80,000 annually from rice, which is an article of diet amongst the poorer classes of the community, is utterly indefensible. Many of those who are not able to get other articles of food can obtain rice and milk-- </para>

                            <para>- There is no member in the Commonwealth Parliament who makes as many misstatements as does the honorable member for Parramatta. Under any circumstances,  1  am not&#34; responsible to him as to how I vote upon rice or any other item; I am responsible only to my constituents. I do not favour the raising of revenue through the Customs House. I prefer a direct tax of any description to an indirect tax, which must have the effect of very largely increasing- the price of goods. Seeing that rice is an article of daily &#39; diet with a large number of our people, and that we have already authorized the payment of a bounty to encourage its production, we should at least wait until the period covered by the bounty has expired before imposing a duty upon the commodity. </para>

                        <para>.- I intend to support the honorable member for Cook. We have now practically dealt with the whole of the food supplies of the .people, and we are in a position to afford them relief only upon the few articles which await consideration. Seeing that the Tariff in its present form imposes very stiff burdens upon the masses, I am compelled to vote in favour of placing as many of the remaining items as possible upon the free list. A duty of 3s. 4d. per cental upon rice is equivalent to about |d. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- Seeing that there are 100 lbs. in a cental, the duty approximates more closely to Jd. per lb. than it does to Jd. per lb. By the time that the importer has passed on the burden to the retailer, and the retailer to the consumer, it will certainly spell more than Jd. per lb. As has already been pointed out, rice is .a commodity which is used by the poorest section of the community. The desire of those who favour the adoption of a protective .policy in respect of rice has already been met by the action of this Parliament in authorizing the payment of a bounty upon the production of that article. I do not consider that an industry which requires to employ the cheapest labour .procurable, in order to make it profitable, is a desirable one to establish in Australia: We have already levied heavy imposts upon the food supplies of the people, and in view of this fact I am prepared to extend to the masses as much relief as possible&#39; on the remaining items in this division. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Cook has apparently overlooked the fact that the bulk, or a large quantity, of the rice imported into the Commonwealth is used for starch making. A proposal has been made by certain starch makers that starch should be free of Excise duty, and, to counteract the resulting loss of Excise revenue, that an import duty be imposed on rice for the manufacture of starch. No rate of import duty is suggested, but it could not be less than that on uncleaned rice, namely, 3s. 4d. per&#39; cental. If this were agreed to, and the import duty on rice for starch making were fixed at 3s. 4d. per cental, there would be a loss of revenue of ,&#163;11,876, based upon 1906 returns,&#39; and assuming tha* all the starch- is made from rice. Thus : - Revenue from Excise of id. per lb. on starch, 1906, ,&#163;27,709. Actual weight of starch on which this. Excise was- paid, 6,650,160 lbs. -Weight of rice required to produce, that quantity of starch, assuming that the starch produced is 70 per cent. of the rice used, 9,500,229 lbs. Import duty on 9,500,229 lbs. at 3s. 4d. per cental,&#163;15,833. Loss of revenue, &#163;11,876. The import of rice last year was 490,669 centals, valued at &#163;248,603 ; rice, uncleaned, 264,198 centals, valued at &#163;117,910. The import of rice for the manufacture of starch was, from India, 930 centals, and from the Straits Settlements, 4,899 centals ;a total of 5,829 centals, valued at &#163;2212. Of rice, n.e.i., principally cleaned, the total import was 279,522 centals, valued at &#163;128,481. I wish in this matter to carry out what is really the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, as there is very little difference between the duties recommended by both sections of that Commission. For this and other reasons, . I hope that the honorable member will not press his amendment. He should recognise, also, that the Excise duty on starch will have to be dealt with. I point out that the Excise duty on starch made from rice is1d. per lb. ; and we propose that, if made from materials grown in the Commonwealth, it shall be free of Excise duty. I do not wish to delay matters, and I should be glad if the Committee would come to a vote on this item as soon as&#39; possible. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think that we are justified in voting for as high a duty on rice as that proposed under the old Tariff. It is purely a revenue duty, and will continue to be so unless the attempt to encourage the rice-growing industry by way of a bounty is successful. Its success is a matter on which I am at present withholding judgment ;  but, even if the industry should prove to be successful, it is not likely to be attended by any important results for a considerable time to come. Speaking for myself, I object to revenue duties as such where they can be avoided. I have no big objection, however, to duties on narcotics and stimulants. As one who smokes and drinks a little, I am prepared to pay a little extra for luxuries of that description. I feel that raising duties under a protective Tariff on articles the manufacture of which we wish to encourage in Australia, we must in a large number of cases inevitably increase the cost to the consumer for a time at any rate. &#34; The new industries can only be brought into existence gradually, and, of course, in the meantime, the price of the imported article must go up. When we are imposing that burden on the consumer I do not think we are justified in adding to it by imposing high revenue duties as well. I think that honorable members generally, and especially protectionist members, should take action to prevent even the maintenance of the present comparatively high duty, on this item. As bread is likely to be dear for some time, to come owing to the comparative failure of the wheat crop, there is an additional reason why the duty on rice should be reduced to some extent, in order that a) substitute for wheat may be available at a low cost. I am prepared to support the amendment of the Honorable member for Cook. </para>

                        <para>The result of (a) is that the starch mill is really a. bond under supervision by the Customs officials, and the Excise is payable on starch, leaving it at the rate levied,1d per lb. The mill being thus a bond, the Customs officials will, we are informed, not permit the manufacture of starch from materials grown in the Commonwealth such as wheat, maize, or potatoes, as the yield would, they think, in a mill where starch is also manufactured from rice, be difficult to trace, and possibly loss to the revenue would result. </para>

                    <para>There would be no difficulty where the manufacturers have two mills, as they could make starch from rice in one mill, and from materials grown in the &#39;Commonmealth in the other. Where the manufacturer has only one mill, the factory is practically a bond, and he is compelled to pay Excise on his starch whether made from imported&#39; rice or from materials grown in the Commonwealth. In . this way, the small man, who has only one mill, is penalized. Messrs. Lewis and Whitty go on to say - </para>

                        <para>To get over this difficulty and assure full payment to the revenue, we would ask that a duty be levied payable on rice for starch purposes, before it is converted into starch, equivalent to the amount of the Excise duty. </para>

                        <para>The Departmental representatives fix 68 per cent. as the starch yield of a ton of rice; therefore the duty would be a fraction less than &#163;67s. per ton, equal to the Excise of1d. per lb., or, say, 6s. 4d. per cwt. </para>

                    <para class="block">I believe that the rice used in the manufacture of starch is that included in the Tariff as &#34;rice n.e.i.,&#34; and dutiable at 6s. per cental, so that under their proposal they would have to pay slightly more on rice they use than they have to pay under existing circumstances. I trust that the Minister will accept the alteration I have suggested, in order that the small manufacturers of starch may be placed on equal terms with those who have more than one starch mill. Under this proposal, once the rice was imported and destroyed for the purpose of starch-making, there would be no further trouble ; whilst under the existing system, the Excise officers are compelled to be present at the factory during the whole of the time the starch mill is working, and the factory is practically a Customs bond. </para>

Now that the matter has come before Parliament, I shall vote to make the duty on rice as low as possible, if I cannot get this article placed on the free list. It has been said that rice is used chiefly by the- Chinese. If that be so, the white inhabitants of Australia will do well to ta.ke a leaf out of their book, and use it more largely. So far as children are concerned, rice cooked with milk is the finest food in the world. </para>

                            <para>- I think not. The work cannot employ any labour to speak of, and the difference to which I have referred will go mostly, info the pockets of the employers who undertake the cleaning within the Commonwealth, while the general public will, probably, have to use rice of a poorer quality than they have hitherto been in the habit of using. Since I have lived in Victoria, attending the meetings of this Parliament, my household has found it very difficult to obtain rice as good as that which we used to get in Western Australia, and I speak with some knowledge of the article, as, in the early days of the gold-fields there rice and condensed milk was a very popular food. In my opinion, the general inferiority of the rice now used is due to the Tariff, the Western Australian duty having been much lower than the Commonwealth duty. It would be of advantage to the general public to make these duties as low as possible, and the revenue would not suffer materially if we made a smaller difference between the rates on cleaned and uncleaned rice. In my opinion, the finer qualities of rice are imported cleaned, and it is only right that the preparation of this commodity should take place in the country of origin. How absurd it would be if tea were sent here in a half -prepared state. </para>

                        <para>.- So far as the duty on uncleaned rice is concerned, it must be regarded wholly as a revenue duty, because rice is not yet produced in Australia. We have agreed to the granting of. a bounty, to encourage the production of rice, and. it may hereafter be thought proper to impose duties to protect it; but at the present time we are considering what is merely a revenue duty on the food of the people. </para>

                        <para>.- I understood the Treasurer to say at the beginning of his speech that about two-thirds of the imported rice is used in the manufacture of starch. He quoted a number of figures which. I cannot make tally with the total quantity he stated. According to the schedule which has : been placed in. our hands about 549,549 centals of rice were imported last year. But I find that the quantity of rice used in the manufacture of starch and delivered free as prescribed by the by-laws was only 5,829 centals. I desire to ascertain from the Treasurer whether that represents the total quantity used in making starch. </para>

                    <para>Mr.STORRER (Bass) . &#91;4.32&#93;- I . do not understand why the honorable member for Cook should propose that because we have offered a bounty upon the production of rice the article should be. admitted duty  free.  If we give a bounty and remove the duty, it. will mean a greater loss . to, the grower, of ,  rice than would .  be the case if we maintained, the duty, and offered no bounty. On the other hand; the honorable member stated, that, this is purely a revenue duty. If it is a revenue duty, and it is removed, where shall we get the revenue with which to pay the proposed bounty ? If we lose all our revenue, we shall have no money available for that purpose. If, however,itisaprotectionistduty,as was admitted by the  deputy,  leader- of the Opposition some time ago, I. do hot think that honorable members, should repeal . duties which have been imposed . for some time. In my opinion, the, Committee will dowell to consider the requirements of the States. The Commonwealth Government may. afford to do without -the revenue -from this duty, but seeing that three-fourths-.of the Customs . and Excise- revenue has to be returned to the. States, we should&#39; consider their position . as well as our own.. </para>

I notice that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of3s.4d. per cental, as the Government have -proposed; while the free-trade section recommended a duty of 3s.. per cental. I intend to vote for the duty remaining as it is.I hope that the  Committee  and the Government will keep in mind the revenue requirements of the various States. </para>

It is contended by some honorable members that this must be regarded as a revenue duty because no rice of a marketable kind is . being produced.. We agreed to a bounty upon the production of rice, because we believed that it would become a natural product of the Commonwealth. </para>

In those islands there is no sugar produced by white laboureither?The question is whether the Committee is desirous of assisting . those industries of the soil which it is most difficult to establish and maintain on a .white labour basis. While this may be a revenue duty now, the object is to make it a protective duty, and, <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> course, to encourage production. It would not be defensible at the present time on a purely revenue basis. The honorable member for Perth has urged that  it  would be far better to allow rice to come  in  free from. other countries. It must be  iri  the recollection of honorable members who have been reading the newspapers that a large  importation of lime-coated rice has taken place. Surely no one would be prepared to allow lime-coated rice to come in as cleaned rice. </para>

                            <para>- It would. I am merely answering the argument which has been advanced in favour of making the article duty free. In view of the State Health Acts, and Pure Foods Acts, and also in view of our policy of new protection, which I hope will be enacted during this Parliament, it is only fair that we should do everything that is possible to encourage the production and manufacture of every kind of article. Besides being the means of assisting the farmer to grow rice, this duty will enable our manufacturers to clean imported rice. That undoubtedly follows. I take it that if the duty be removed, the local industry of rice cleaning will disappear. </para>

                            <para>- Whilst much might be said regarding what has transpired in connexion with the cleaning and production of rice in Australia, I think that under our Wages Boards and the new protection fair and reasonable conditions of labour and remuneration will be assured to the employes in this and other industries. Before deciding, to abolish the duty we ought at least to allow time for the bounty on rice to operate. If, after a year of two, it . be found that rice is not being locally produced, it will be open to Parliament to place it on the free list.;  but since there is hope of its being produced in Australia I trust that the Committee will support . the Government proposal. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable, member&#39;s concluding argument is a very, specious one. He urges the Committee tQ support the duty .on the .under standing that if within the next few years we have not a very considerable production of rice in Australia we should be able to place this item on the free list. The honorable member knows perfectly well that there will be little chance of re-opening the Tariff, more particularly to deal- with only one item, during the next three years. </para>

                            <para>- I shall always hail with delight an opportunity to vote for a reduction of the Tariff. I intend to vote for the amendment, and should like to know why the Government have raised the duty beyond the rate proposed by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. Even the honorable member for South Sydney, who is a staunch protectionist, said he would not care if the duty were removed. Apparently he does not attach very much importance to its retention. There are certainly less than twenty hands employed in the rice cleaning  industry in Australia. The invoice prices of rice f.o.b. are as follow : - No. 1 uncleaned, Japan, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;14.</inline> 17s. 4d. per ton; Straits Settlements, &#163;8 7s. 6d. per ton; No. 1, cleaned, Japan, &#163;17 per ton ; Straits Settlements, <inline font-style="italic">&#163; 10</inline> 5s. per ton. The Australian rice cleaners import these varieties in about equal quantities and mix them for sale. They sell the cleaned product as the best dressed rice. Rice sold in the local market during the last few years has deteriorated. The differential duty is equal to 2s. 8d. per cental, or about &#163;3 per ton in favour of the rice cleaners. Surely that is an enormous concession. In Law&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Grocers&#39; Manual,</inline> a recognised authority, the process of rice cleaning is described as follows - </para>

                        <para>Rough rice is called &#34; paddy,&#34; but before coming into the retailers&#39; hands it is softened and husked in a mill : a sort of mortar, studded in. side with metal, to prevent the pestle crushing the grain while rubbing off the skin or husk, after which operation it is quickly dried, and is then ready for use. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">It will be seen that this is a very simple operation. Practically the whole expense entailed is the cost of the mill. The total cost of manufacture certainly does not exceed <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;i</inline> per ton. The whole process consists of the employment of a man to feed a machine and to take away from it the sacks as. they are filled with the cleaned product. Twenty men could supply double the requirements of the whole Australian market. Rice was dressed in Victoria before the honorable member for Mernda or any one else asked for a protective duty. Apparently the duty was imposed in response to al request by a certain individual interested in the trade in Victoria, and the only result of the duty has been to create a monopoly, the whole business really being in the hands of three firms. The operation of the duty has resulted in an inferior kind of rice being foisted upon the Australian market. In the circumstances I see no reason why the amendment .that &#39; the item be placed on the free list should not be agreed to. In the event of its rejection I shall move that the duty be reduced to 2s. per cental. </para>

                        <para>.- I shall heartily support a proposal to impose a duty on prepared rice. Unlike the honorable member for Perth, I think that we cannot have too much supervision over articles  introduced from countries such as those from which rice is imported. The honorable member said that tea comes in free of duty and ready for use. But  1  happen to know that some of the large firms - Edwards and Company, for instance - have machines for the purpose of cleaning a quantity of the tea which they sell. It is during the packing and shipping that the dirt gets into these commodities. The argument of the honorable member for Perth in regard to rice seems to me rather absurd. Rice that is imported in the husk is protected against dirt to some extent. If the cleansing is done here, we shall have a guarantee that we are getting rice, and not something with Chinese, Japanese, or Hindoo mud upon it. Honorable members should also give attention to the fact that when these articles are packed in Australia we encourage the manufacture of such goods as .tins and packets. If we impose a high duty on cleaned rice we shall achieve our purpose in that respect. </para>

                        <para>-53] - I am quite prepared to vote to allow uncleaned rice to come in free. I look upon this as absolutely a revenue-producing item. It is one in which the Treasurer is interested rather than the Minister of Trade and Customs. I shall vote against increasing the duties on any items that I regard as principally revenue-producing. If I thought there was any chance in the immediate future of rice being produced in Australia, I should be prepared to vote for a duty even on uncleaned rice, but the very fact that the Government proposed a, bounty on rice shows that they do not think there is much likelihood of its being grown in Australia: </para>

But it is protective .in another way than from the prospect and opportunity the duty affords of enabling rice to be produced here ; and that is in regard to the manufacture- of starch. It is not a very high duty. </para>

                            <para>- It amounts to about one-third of id. per lb. There is, I think, some misunderstanding as to what is done with rice imported for starch making purposes. Such rice goes into bond or into bonded starch-making premises,, and an Excise ot &#34; id. per lb. is charged as it is taken out. Maize and other things are mixed with it. In a given quantity of . starch there may be 70 per cent, of rice, the balance consisting of maize. The imported, rice will have to pay the id. per lb. . Excise; but any goods produced in the Commonwealth that&#39; are added to it for starch-making purposes will not be charged the Excise. </para>

                            <para>- It appears/ then, . that out of 549,549 centals of- rice, 544,000 odd are used as food, and only 5,000 odd are used in the manufacture of starch. In reality we are dealing &#39;with what is really a food rather than a raw material of manufacture. I support the free admission of this item, because it is; essentially a poor man&#39;s food.&#39; The &#39;&#39;argument of the honorable member for New&#39; England about clean rice does not apply, because most people know what they are buying.&#39; It may be true that rice &#34;mixed1 with&#39; dirt is imported, but we do not see much of it ; and, as pointed out by the&#39; honorable member for Perth and the honorable mem&#34;per for Lang, the result of the increased duty under paragraph&#39; c&#39; has been&#34; the importation of rice of an inferior quality. Rice is &#39;a- really good food;&#39; which would be much better, especially.: for children, than an entirely meat diet.&#34;! &#62;Rice is becoming more and more used . as&#60;-.&#38;. porridge food. . </para>

                        <para>- - Although I voted in favour of the last amendment, I am inclined to think that the margin between 3s. 4d. and 4s. per cental would not be sufficient to compensate for the loss that is involved in the cleaning of rice. Not only is there a considerable loss sustained from the standpoint of quantity, but the labour that is employed has also to be considered, and the two combined would scarcely be represented by a difference of 8d. per cental. I, therefore, move - </para>

                        <para>.-- This item is one of very great importance to the dairying industry. The duty under the old Tariff was 12s. 6d. per ton or 15 per cent, as oilmen&#39;s stores, and under that duty our producers of salt were able to carry on their industry profitably in the manufacture of all classes of salt commonly used. In these circumstances there is no necessity to further tax the dairying industry. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to know the reason for the altered form of the duty on this item, and its probable effect. The Government are in this case substituting an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty for a duty at a- fixed rate per ton. So far as I can gather, the alteration will not make any great difference in the amount of the duty to be paid, and that being so, I think it is undesirable to substitute an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty for a fixed duty on an article that is always sold by weight, when in such case it is&#34; much easier to check a fixed duty. </para>

                            <para>- The duty under the old Tariff was 12s. 6d. per tori, or  15  per cent, as oilmen&#39;s stores. When we have a specified line in the Tariff referring to salt, I do not see how the article could be legally classified as oilmen&#39;s stores. It would only be salt in bottles that was so classified. I think it would be &#39; preferable to have a fixed duty on this item, and I should like to have some information on the subject and some reason given for the proposed change in the form of the duty. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the departmental reason - that in this form, as likely to lead to fewer disputes, it would be much easier to collect the duty - is a very good reason. I have had great experience of the work of the Customs Department, and nearly all the trouble in that Department arises in defining the item under which a particular article imported should be included. The change is proposed for greater convenience in administration. </para>

                            <para>- To my mind, a fixed duty is infinitely better than an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, and the &#34;Minister has admitted that in this case the fixed rate suggested is practically equivalent to the. <inline font-style="italic">ad .valorem</inline> rate. As -all ether- salt - is charged . at . a. fixed rate, I think . that we should not make- an exception in this case. </para>

                            <para>- It costs more -  in some cases from 20 per .cent, to ..&#39;40&#39; per cent, more-7-to send- salt &#34;from&#39; South Australia to New South Wales than from&#39; England to Australia,. A duty of 12s-.. 6d.. a ton will not cover the freight f rpm the &#34;Old Country to Australia. The argument has been&#39; advanced that. the. salt industry &#39;.does not require more protection, because the production has overtaken the consumption, but that is not so. . If honorable members will make inquiries, they will&#39; find&#39; that a good deal of . salt &#39; which is exported&#39; .is crude salt. If they deduct- the &#39;crude salt from the other &#39;.salt, they will find- that 4,000 tons were . imported, &#34;last year. &#39;In fact, the , imports are increasing greatly. Since the&#39; present duty was imposed one company have gone to the &#34;.wall,&#34; and I have &#39; no. doubt but . that, others will succumb unless something &#39;more is&#34; done for the industry&#39; than has been done. It &#34;should &#39; also be remembered that, lately trie price of labour has increased greatly, in South Australia the manufacturers have raised the wages of &#34;unskilled labourers from 6s. to 7s. a day, and the wages of skilled workers in - .proportion, and &#39;&#39;they have not&#39; added &#34;to- the cost of their salt. I suggest f hat when., the manufacturers -are prepared to make such, increases honorable members should .give them a. little, encouragement. It should, also be pointed, .out that this is not a. small. industry. In -South Australia .about -3,500 persons, derive their existence from. the salt industry. . - . </para>

Instead, .qf manufacturers in Australia being unable -to&#39; compete with importations we: found; that  they had been &#39;able to export, large  quantities  of their salt into markets beyond:the Commonwealth* . The ..&#39; Castle.- Salt Cooperative  0  Company of South Australia for &#34;some, years. ., has. been sending large quantities, to &#39;New .Zealand,;, its .average annual shipments to that Colony, according  to evidence .submitted , by_ . the company being from 5,000&#39; to 6,000 tons. That does not1 suggest that the:.local companies -&#39;are unable to compete with .oversea productions. it has been said, that the importation &#39;, qf .salt -has been increasing. ., The facts do not support that contention.-  A statement compiled from the Commonwealth Trade, and Customs returns. shows .that, .the importations of all salt other than brown rock salt have been as follows: - 1899, 128,183 tons; 1900, 19,632 tons; 1901, 22,022 tons; 1902, 18,416 tons; 1903, 8,650 tons ; 1904, 14,868 tons ; 1905, 13,555 tons <inline font-style="italic">&#62;</inline> ar,d 1906, 8,796 tons. These figures show, on the whole, a steady decrease in importations, and, taking into consideration our exports of salt, it may be said that we are able to produce practically all that we require. There is one paragraph in the finding of the free-trade section of the Commission which I recommend to the attention of honorable members. It reads1 - </para>

                        <para>The total cost of production, including harvesting and all charges, is nearly covered by the present duty. Freight, present duty, and other transit charges on imported salt, vary from 75 to 130 per cent, on the f.o.b. value, while the present duty alone is equal to more than, 50 per cent, of the shipping value of the best coarse salt, which is used for curing purposes. </para>

                        <para>Finally, the evidence clearly proves that the salt industry in Australia has greatly expanded under the operation of the Commonwealth Tariff, and that it has been more profitable than previously to the manufacturers, although consumers have in some States contributed through enhanced prices to this prosperity. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The reference to the enhanced prices means that there has been an arrangement by which the trade of the States has been apportioned. If honorable members wish to accentuate that state of things they have only to vote for the Government proposal. On the other hand, if they are satisfied that this industry, as the evidence undoubtedly shows, has fared very well, that it has practically secured the whole of the trade, and that only an insignificant portion is supplied from over-sea, then I feel sure that they will vote for a reversion to the old duty. Since salt is undoubtedly a requirement of the great butter industry of the Commonwealth, it is highly desirable that the duty should not be increased, because that would simply mean a tax upon that industry. I do not say that Australian salt when properly refined is not equal to the very best imported salt. When proper care is taken in regard to the refining process Australian salt is equal in quality to any that is imported. The question is really whether the butter- producers of Australia are to be taxed for the benefit of the salt-producing industry which, as the evidence submitted to the Tariff Commission shows very conclusively, was able to carry on very comfortably under the qld rate of duty. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to support the reduction of the duty to 12s. 6d. per ton, and wish to avail myself of this opportunity to reply to the references that have frequently been made to the attitude which I took up on this question when the first Federal Tariff was under consideration. If any honorable member doubts my word, it is quite easy for him to trace my votes in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> As a matter of fact, the duty originally proposed under the old&#34; Tariff was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;x</inline> per ton. The Committee reduced it to ios.- per ton. Then there was an attempt to make it 15s. per ton, but a compromise was arrived at, and the duty was fixed at 12s. 6d. What I did - and this is the vote which has induced some honorable members to say that I slipped - was to refuse to support a recommittal. I regarded the duty of 12s. 6d. per ton as a compromise, and would not vote for interfering with it. I believe that that duty is quite sufficient. I observe that whenever the Queensland representatives have a chance of securing a duty on an item which specially interests their State, they vote for it solidly, irrespective of whether the commodity in question is actually being&#34; produced in Queensland or not. However, their conduct has nothing to do with me ; I intend to be consistent, though I suppose that I&#39; could very easily put forward a good -case on behalf of the producers of salt for a higher duty. </para>

Weeks ago I gave notice of an amendment to reduce the duty to 12s. 6d. per ton, in conformity with the compromise arrived at when the last Tariff was debated. If the Minister takes the trouble to look through the list of amendments which I have circulated, he will find that the duties which I support are considerably below those in the existing Tariff. </para>

The duty of 12s! 6d. per ton was the result of a compromise.. But the honorable member has forgotten to tell the Committee that had he voted with the Opposition on that occasion for a recommittal of the item, that duty, in all probability, would have been reduced. </para>

                            <para>-  The honorable member is quite correct. This is an industry which especially concerns the electorates of the honorable member for Grey and the honorable member for Corio. I know the salt pans on Yorke Peninsula very well. They are close to the sea, in St. Vincent&#39;s Gulf, and there is no expense attached to the conveyance of the commodity to a railway or to the port of shipment. The natural protection given to the industry is quite sufficient of itself. I used to do a good deal of business in this class of salt some years ago, and the South Australian company, at that time, used to sell salt at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per ton. Since then the industry has developed into a very fine thing, and numbers of people have gone into it. It is flourishing. The honorable member for Perth has told us that salt is now being exported. Of  course, people who have been in the habit of using very fine imported salt for table purposes will continue to use it, no matter what the duty may be. But we now export -quite as much as we import, and the local competition has been sufficient to bring about a reduction in price. At the period to which I ha.ve referred, salt was produced in competition with the world, and was freely purchased for the curing of hides and skins, the making of bacon, and for dairying purposes. There is no difficulty in producing an excellent article. If we were to carry out the suggestion of the free-trade -section of the Tariff Commission, we should impose a duty of no more than 5s. a ton, which would be. about 25 per cent, on the value of the class of salt I am now speaking about. . That duty will be. quite sufficient for the industry. .The quantity of labour employed is not . considerable, though there is sufficient salt produced to supply the demands of Australia. </para>

                            <para>-  The output is considerable, and it would be still larger if we had a greater population to supply. If we increase the duty the chances are that the price of salt will be increased in the same ratio. I trust that the Committee will adhere to the understanding arrived at amongst honorable members in the last Parliament, namely, that we should adjust anomalies in the Tariff, but not increase duties upon those articles the producers of which are doing very -well. We should rather give a helping hand to those industries that are languishing. This is an industry that is thriving, and could do without any protection whatever. As, however-, we are expected to adhere to the old Tariff as far as possible, I shall vote for a duty of 12s. 6d. per ton. </para>

                        <para>.- I -am glad that in this case no attack has been made on the quality of the Australian article concerned. The honorable member&#39; for Perth has testified to the fact that the quality of the Australian salt produced is excellent. The only criticism that I  have to meet, therefore, is that of the honorable member for Corangamite, who naturally wishes to do his best for the pastoral and dairying industries, and who has argued that an increase in the duty will have the effect of raising- prices owing to the probable establishment of a ring. But if that were likely to be the effect, it would have resulted when the Victorian Parliament imposed a duty of &#163;1 per ton. At that time, although the Moolap Company, which carries on business near Geelong, had the benefit of that duty they sold their salt at 22s. per ton. The honorable member for Corangamite will see. that if the company had sold at the price of imported salt, the Moolap salt would have fetched <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 5s. per ton. We are facing a great danger if we do riot protect the industry sufficiently. There is no doubt that salt is the subject of a worldwide trust.

                        <para>There have been specific denials of the accuracy of cables on the part of the Salt Union of England.; but a New York  correspondent  informs us that the formation of a trust to control almost the entire salt output of the world has been definitely announced at the offices of the National Salt Company, located in the Standard Oil Buildings, No. 26 Broadway. The new company (he says) will embrace the Salt Union of England, the Canadian Salt Company, and the National Salt Company, under the title of the International Salt Company. The concern will also! include the  Saleina  Espanola Spanish salt mines, which were recently acquired by the Union Salt Company, and incorporated under the laws of New Jersey. Standard Oil Company interests, which own the majority of the stock of the National Salt Company, are behind the deal. This will be the first international combine ever formed. The consolidated company will control the salt output of every civilized country on the globe, with the exception of the salt, mines in Russia. The capital will exceed 50,000,000 &#39;dollars. Prominent banking interests have agreed to take charge of the underwriting. </para>

Was quoted at&#163;3per ton. &#39; In November,1904, the price was &#163;2. 15s.; in December, 1904, &#163;2 10s. ; and in April, 1906, &#163;2. Between March, 1904, and October, 1906, the&#39; price of imported salt dropped from&#163;4 5s. to&#163;35s. The same reduction in prices is noted in the case of dairy salt. In July, 1905, imported dairy salt was quoted at &#163;5 5s.; in October, 1906, it was &#163;4 . 2s. 6d. ; and in August, 1907, &#163;4 12s. 6d. &#39; &#34; Mermaid &#34; dairy, the local product, ruled at&#163;4 to &#163;45s.Through the competition of the local article, users of the imported salt have, therefore,, been able to make great savings. </para>

                        <para class="block">The-.point as to whether an increased duty on salt would prejudicially affect any of the. primary industries of the Commonwealth came under the notice of your Commissioners. Having in view the relatively small quantity of it which was used in either meat curing or dairying processes, the extra cost,-which &#39;a higher duty would entail to such industries would be infinitesimal in &#34;amount. This fact is brought out by the Secretary of the&#39; Castle Co-operative Salt, Company, South Australia, who says, &#34;The absurdity of12s.6d. per ton, for duty falling heavily upon the dairy industry is shown by the fact &#34;that only 3. per cent. of salt&#34; is used in -butter-making. The averageprice&#34; of a ton of butter would Be about&#163;100. The salt it contains, at 12s.6d. per ton&#34;, equals 4d.,. or, in other words, there is 1d. worth of salt, at60s. &#39;per ton (price paid by dairies) in 1 cwt. of- butter, valued at &#163;5. </para>

Such salt can be obtained in several of the States&#34;; it is of excellent quality,&#34; bearing favorable comparison with the best imported article. The development of the salt industry in Australia, and the consequent competition resulting therefrom, has had the effect of reducing in a very marked degree the selling price of. salt; to consumers in this country. </para>

                            <para>- If the duty on salt is increased from12s.6d. to&#163;1per &#39;ton; it will not have the effect, Which some honorable members anticipate, of keeping out imported salt. - The colonial salt has had a thorough &#39; trial&#34; throughout - the Commonwealth, and I am pleased to say that it lias given general satisfaction both to butchers and butter makers. I have used it for the last twelve to fourteen years, and prefer it to English salt for butter making, as it is more soluble in butter, and-. Jess liable to crystallize after it is used. But that is not the experience of some of the bacon curers. The imported salt is,. at present principally used by bacon curers and a few butter makers, who still prefer it to the colonial, whether - through Want of giving thelatter&#39; a proper . trial, or through prejudice; I do not know. I have recently received a communication from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Reid, Queensland manager for Messrs.&#39; J. C. Hutton and Company. I need not say anything about the&#39; quality of the Pineapple brand of bacon-&#39; and&#34; -hams, wliich have commended themselves to. the whole of Australia, and to many other parts of the world. </para>

                        <para>We have given the. colonial salts from Adelaide a full and exhaustive experiment,&#39; and the invariable result is that the bacon is dark in colour, very hard and dry, . and altogether a depreciated cure as compared with that which results from the use &#39;of English salt, so that&#39;, if we are forced to use colonial salt,, it means that the reputation which we have got for the cure of our hams and bacons in Australian &#34;and Eastern markets will be largely discounted- to the manifest detriment : of the &#62; curing industry. The; writer is. protectionist enough -to at once support, a colonial industry, if the products f rom that industry are as good as can be got from other countries ;  but we see at once that the colonial salts are not &#34;fitted for the high-class cures at our&#39; various&#39; baconwork&#39;s. They &#39;willsuit beef-curing, but. are altogether unsuitable for bacon. </para>
                        <para>In addition to this, we have pointed put to the Federal Government that the cost of landing salt, without any dutyatall,is 320 percent. on English cost - a - large natural protection, which surely does not require fiscal protection in addition. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Corio said today. that the Victorian Salt Factory were selling their salt sortie time ago at22s. 6d. per ton. A duty of 12s.6d.at that ,  price -is over 50 per cent. protection. Before Federation, when there was a fairly heavy duty on salt in Victoria and South Australia, the South Australian salt was sold in New South Wales and -Queensland at 45s. &#39;per ton. &#39; I believe there was no duty in New&#39; South Wales at that time, but the South Australian companies paid the freight to Queensland, and the duty under the  Queensland Tariff, and still sold their salt in Queensland at the same price as it was&#34; sold at in South Australia. </para>

Before that they paid the dividends away indutyin&#39; order to try to compete&#39;&#39; in the&#34; outside&#39; markets. Since they have had the whole of Australia to themselves,: they have been able to pay a dividend,&#34; as. they have done for the&#34;:last four, years, of about 7&#189; per cent. on the capital invested. They have also written down their capital considerably, and reduced their overdraft by about one-half the amount it was some four years ago. </para>

SINCLAIR.-</inline> I do not. - I want to give them the same opportunity in- the future as they have had in the past. If they have been able to write down their capital considerably, and pay something like ^&#163;4,000 off their overdraft during the past four years, with a protection of 12s. 6d. per ton, I think that they have been doing fairly well. If we wish them to do any better in the future, they are going -to do it at the expense of the consumers of salt. </para>

                            <para>- I obtained my information from the report of the Tariff Commission. If that report is not correct, then my statement is wrong. Prior to Federation we were able to purchase Australian salt for 45s. a ton. Its price has now advanced to 65s. per ton. The price of imported salt usually ranges from 75s.- to 85s. per ton, so that the Australian article appears to enjoy a very good natural protection. It has deservedly earned a name for itself amongst the consumers, and consequently it has nothing to fear from outside competition. To my mind, 12s. 6d. per. ton represents a very heavy impost. </para>

                        <para>. - Various statements have been made in connexion with the salt industry, some of which will scarcely withstand analysis. The honorable member for Hindmarsh has said that if the present duty is not increased from 12s. 6d. to 20s. per ton, the industry in South Australia will probably be destroyed. I am aware that this Committee has displayed great liberality by granting to many industries a protection which, according to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, they do not require. I disagree with the Honorable member in the view which he entertains, because the whole of the testimony presented to that body shows that since the imposition of the first Commonwealth Tariff, under which a duty of 12s. <inline font-style="italic">66.</inline> per- ton was collected, the salt companies both in South Australia and Victoria have been doing remarkably well. </para>

                            <para>- I, shall show the dividends which have been paid in that State. It has been said that one South Australian company has gone to the wall. I am quite aware of that fact, because I happened to be a shareholder in it. But that company did not go to the wall in consequence of competition from beyond Australia. It failed purely owing to internal reasons. That this is so is shown by the fact that a number of those who were interested in the venture formed a new company, which was perfectly satisfied that it could profitably conduct its operations under the old rate of duty. From the report of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission I find that - </para>

                        <para>The Castle Salt Co-operative Company of South Australia, according to the evidence of its secretary, did not pay any dividends prior to Federation ; the first dividend paid was is. per share in one half-year of 1902. In the years 1903 and 1904 the dividends were is. 6d. per share, and 9a. per share had been declared for the first half of the year 190.5, equal to <inline font-style="italic">l\</inline> per cent. There had been, however, considerable writing down of plant and purchase of new machinery out of proceeds, whilst the company&#39;s indebtedness to its bankers of &#163;8,297 in the 1904 account, had been reduced to ^4,400 in the 1905 statement. The actual net profits earned, without special provisions for repairs, &#38;c, appear to have been a shade over 10 per cent, per annum in those two years. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is testimony that the company in question progressed more under the operation of a duty of 12s. 6d. per ton than it did under the old South Australian rate of 20s. per&#39; ton. The reason for this is obvious ; the market for its product had been enlarged. The honorable member for Corio has stated that the Australian companies were entirely dissociated from combines. I understood him to say that if they were not, he would not support the increased duty .proposed. Here is a statement from the report of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission in reference to the Castle Salt Company - </para>

                        <para>The average annual shipments of this company, according to that witness, were 5,000 to 6,000 tons. The salt was consigned to agents in New Zealand, and sold on the company&#39;s account at prices about the same as* in Victoria, although the freight was less to that State, but they did as well out of the business in New Zealand as out of that in Victoria, there being a difference in the qualities of the salt. It was admitted, in reply to further questions, that there was an arrangement with the&#39; English Salt Union as to the- partition of the trade of New Zealand, regulating the quantities each should sell, and the prices, which were made uniform. This arrangement gave the English salt a little better result than it obtained in Australia.  lt will be seen, therefore, that this company forms part of a large combine which is operating in New Zealand. But there is nothing to prevent it adopting similar tactics in the Commonwealth. Apart from that fact, the progress of the .salt industry, under the operation of the old rate of duty, has been very gratifying. Since 1899 the imports of salt have declined from 28,000 tons to 8,700 tons. Our manufacturers have captured nearly the whole of the trade of the Commonwealth, the consumption of which is estimated at from 40,000 to 50,000 tons per annum. Under these circumstances, what reason can be advanced for departing from the old rate of duty of 12s. 6d. per ton? </para>

                        <para>.- I intend to propose a reduction of this duty. The old duty on perfumed, toilet, and medicated soap was 3d. per lb., and on soap n.e.i., including polishing, Jd. per lb. The duty now proposed is an all-round duty of 25 per cent. I am at a loss tb understand why the Minister has not proposed a , preference in connexion with this item, seeing that the great bulk of our importations of soap come from the Old Country. Of perfumed toilet and other similar soaps, we imported from the United Kingdom 583,918 lbs. Importations were received also from Canada, Hong Kong, India, New Zealand, Straits Settlements, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States. As compared with the importation from the United Kingdom, our next largest importation was from the United States, from which we received 235&#62;243 lbs and the third largest importation was from Germany, from which country we received only 55,026 lbs. of the perfumed and fancy soaps. Of the soaps n.e.i. which are imported, by far the largest quantity! comes from Great Britain. The total importation of soaps n.e.i. is 1,147,486 lbs., of which 1,125,656 lbs. come from Great Britain, and only n.,830 lbs. from other places- Cape Colony, New Zealand, the Straits Settlements, Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, and the United States. Therefore the duty falls mainly on British manufactures. The old duty on perfumed toilet and medicated soaps was equivalent to from 20 to 40 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> according to quality, while the expenses of importation amounted to 20 per cent. Of polishing soap, Brook&#39;s Monkey brand is practically the only kind imported. It is invoiced at  17s  . 3d. per  50  lbs., arid the old duty was equivalent to  12  per cent&#34;.&#39; <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> the importing expenses coming to  20  per cent. On household soaps invoiced at from21s. 3d. to  24s.  3d., the old duty was equivalent to about  22 percent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> while the expenses of importation were about&#34; 35 per cent. Therefore it will be seen that, with the exception of the cheaper toilet soaps, the substitution of the proposed <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> ratesfor the old fixed rates means really a substantial increase&#39; of duty. In  1900,  prior to Federation and the imposition of the first Commonwealth Tariff, the importation of toilet soaps&#39; Was  820, 774  lbs., and in  1966 65,840  lbs., an enormous falling  off.  Of household soaps there were imported in  1900 1,572,592  lbs., and in  1906 1,147,486 &#39; lbs.  - During recent years the Commonwealth has commenced to export soaps largely to other countries. </para>

                            <para>-As we can now compete in the markets of the world with the manufactures of other countries, the soap industry of the Commonwealth certainly does hot need higher duties; I believe that it could do without any protection. In 1900 we exported  9,280  lbs. of toilet soaps&#39;, and in  1906  the exportation had increased to52,  986  lbs. Of household soaps we exported in  1900 1,687,504  lbs., and in 1906- no &#39; less than  &#39;4, 652,816  lbs. </para>

                            <para>-I dp .not know whether the object of the amendment is to increase the importation of. soap. It cannot be -said that  a duty on soap will affect the breakfast, &#39; or the dinner, or&#39; the tea table of the much-talked-about poor working man. We know that Australian common soap does not come into competition with imported soap. -The imports consist chiefly of perfumed  and fancy soap, which someperson&#39;s like to use in their baths and which, I think, can very well afford to paya&#39; duty. In view of the fact that most labour is used in the production of fancy soap, I think that the Government might very well have considered the matter from a. different standpoint. The duty on perfumed soap used to be 3d. a lb,,&#39; but, in spite of that, we must have imported&#163;70,000 worth per annum. We might encourage the local production  of that soap, and &#39;therefore I suggest to the Government that they should seriously consider  the question of raising the duty on imported soap to 6d. a lb. In making that suggestion I am not advocating &#34;uncleanliness, because those who buy perfumed soap and shaving sticks can afford to pay the price charged. I do not believe that the extra amount which they would have to pay if my suggestion were adopted would be a great consideration to them. It is certainly of great commercial &#39;interest to Australia that the higher class of soap should be manufactured here, because its. manufacture would employ a large quantity of labour, and would not injure one person in the community. I feel satisfied that even the electors&#39; who returned , the members of the Opposition would not object to pay a little more for their perfumed soap. </para>

                        <para>.- I - was hoping to hear on this occasion that the Treasurer intended to stick to his guns, because, with an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, the higher the price the higher will the impost be. For that reason, high-class soaps will pay a higher duty than they used to pay. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who was pleading for the imposition of a high duty on high-priced soaps,  will achieve his object in that way, I think. </para>

If we enter the lavatory, where my honorable friends wash their protectionist hands, we find there  a cake of Rimmel&#39;s soap fresh from Paris. We do not see about the House a colonial article except a- suit of clothes which a gentleman wears on exhibition. I do not know who has authority over the arrangements of this building, but I think that in this Parliament we ought to set the fashion in regard to the use of colonial articles. Whatever our fiscal views may be, we ought to give  a  preference to all colonial articles that are not absolutely injurious. I understand that my honorable friends draw the line at colonial beer. </para>

To-day we have seen a foreign horse, which on entering our closely-protected country from New Zealand was not subjected to a duty of even 10s., carrying away one of the richest sporting prizes in the Commonwealth. We have a grand horse-breeding industry struggling against untold difficulties, and yet we have allowed this foreign horse, bred in a foreign country, fed on foreign oats and corn, and groomed by foreign hands, to come into the Commonwealth, and to annex the richest stake known in the sporting arena. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but I was going to suggest that  possibly  there is a reason for the importation of the cheaper class of soaps. I have yet to learn that there is manufactured in Australia .a toilet soap which has for its alkaline basis anything other than ordinary caustic soda, which is undoubtedly injurious to the human skin. Many of the toilet soaps imported and. sold at a&#39; reasonable rate are in that respect of superior quality, since they contain a harmless alkaline which, so far as I am aware, has not yet been introduced into any Australian soap. I do not wish to name them, but it is unreasonable to impose upon soaps of that class a prohibitive duty. I bare riot how high a duty may be imposed on soaps sold for their paper wrappings and delicate perfumes, but I think that an&#34; all-round duty of 25 per cent, would be a fair impost, and would meet the case even from a protectionist stand-point.  Amendment agreed to. </para>

                        <para>.- This seems to be a fair opportunity to offer a very moderate preference in favour of the Mother Country. A very large quantity of imported soap comes from the United Kingdom, and with a duty of 25 per cent, against foreign countries, 5 per cent., which is only one-fifth, is a very moderate preference to offer. After the magnificent oration of the Prime Minister a fortnight ago his supporters might surely be capable of giving preference to the tune of 5 per cent, to the Mother Country. We have now come to the practical aspect of thi-, preference policy. The duty proposed amounts to about 4d. per lb., and surely a preference of one halfpenny might Le tolerated. This is one of those practical little ways in which we can show our loyal attachment to the Mother Country, and which will be much more valuable than a brilliant speech. </para>

                        <para>Your statement of the case for what has been called the &#34;new protection&#34; is timely. I wish to present a side of this question which has hitherto been unduly negated. The cost of the rice from which the starch is made is about &#163;8 a ton; the yield of starch varies, but may not unfairly be put down at 72 per cent., so that to produce1 ton of starch, raw material worth about &#163;11 is necessary. The Excise duty -1d. a lb. - costs &#163;9 6s.8d. per ton ; the cost of producing a ton of starch is &#163;2 12s. 6d., a fact which I have from one of the three manufacturers. Accordingly,&#163;23 represents the prime cost of the starch per ton. Even at a selling price of&#163;34 per ton - which seems to have been the bedrock price - there is left &#163;11 per ton for cost of distribution, advertising, travellers&#39; expenses, and profits. If, as the manufacturers assert, there is a heavy loss, then with what sense of fairness can they lay it to the account of cost of production, viz., &#163;2 12s. 6d. per ton, an amount of which the wages paid to the workmen is, after all, only a portion? Why not set it down, as every one who knows all the facts, to the exorbitant expenses incurred in advertising, travellers&#39; expenses, rebates to customers, as well as to the cost of distribution ? </para>
                        <para>The amount set down as the cost of production, &#163;2 12s. 6d. per ton, is not entirely spent on wages. It includes machinery charges, fuel, water, repairs, cost of packages, boxes, &#38;c., and therefore the wages paid do not absorb the whole of this. An increase - say of 20 per cent. - on &#163;2 10s. would bring the cost of production up to &#163;3 per ton, but even then this would be comparatively small as compared with the&#163;11 per ton which the manufacturers assert is spent in other ways. The Judge was therefore correct in practically saying that in this unhealthy and unnecessary competition the workmen suffered. Competition may be the life of trade, but it need not mean death to humane feeling. </para>

                        <para>- 1 observe that both sections of the Tariff Commission recommend a duty of Jd. per lb. on this item, that duty being in accordance with the old Tariff. In face of that recommendation, the Government propose to place starch flours on the same plane as starch; and I&#34; think that that must have been done under a misapprehension. Although, in a chemical sense, starch flours are starch, still they are not starch in a commercial sense. Starch flours are not used for laundry purposes, but are largely used for food purposes, and for &#39;confectionery dressings, and so forth ; and it is absurd to place- the duty on this commodity at the ridiculous figure proposed. I should like to move that after the word &#34; flours &#34; the words &#34; for making laundry starch &#34;&#39; be inserted. </para>

                        <para>. - Ever since the last Tariff was passed the Department has had a good deal of trouble in deciding the difference between starch and starch flours. The items have been separated in this Tariff, because it was found to be almost impossible to tell which was which. No doubt a good deal of advantage has been taken of the Department on that account. It was impossible to tell exactly what the article was without constantly referring to the- chemists in every State. Cornflour is a starch flour, and the duty on that has already been fixed at 2d. &#39;  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson.</inline> - Cornflour is only starch in a chemical sense. Tt is not  what is known commercially as starch for laundry purposes. </para>

                            <para>- I am advised that cornflour is in the same category as starch flour. It was found almost impossible to collect the duty under the conditions that existed before this Tariff was introduced. Although it is a small matter in itself, it has caused constant, trouble to the Department, and there have been disputes almost every few days as to whether an article was starch flour or not.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sinclair.</inline> - Could it not be got in as arrowroot? </para>

                        <para>.- I had intended to move the same amendment as that moved by the honorable member for Moreton. I am. however, prepared to rely upon the Minister&#39;s word if he assures the Committee that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> will cover it. &#39; I wish the Minister to make it perfectly clear that if any manufacturer is engaged in making starch from such materials a? potatoes or maize, he will be also allowed to carry on in the same factory the operation of making starch from rice. I have no doubt that the Customs Department can look after itself, except perhaps, in the . matter of the harvester &#39; Excise, in which apparently they have not moved: I hope that they will  see that the small manufacturer is not penalized by compelling him to have one factory for making starch from rice and another factory for ma&#39;king starch from other materials. That would Le giving the large manufacturer too great an advantage. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Yarra is quite right in saying that the Tariff ought to be framed so that it shall not be. equivocal. Although rice is not being grown in the Commonwealth now, a bounty is to be offered for its growth, and before Parliament deals with the Tariff again it is quite possible that rice grown in the Commonwealth will be used for the manufacture of starch. If the word &#34;imported &#34; be inserted, it will have the effect that the Minister desires, and at the same time will obviate the possibility of rice produced within the Commonwealth and used for starch-making purposes having the Excise imposed on it. It is quite possible that by-and-by rice grown in Australia will be used for the purposes indicated, in which case it would come under  paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> whilst at the same time, being made from rice, it would also fall equally under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> This apparent contradiction would be overcome by the amendment of the honorable member for Moreton. </para>

                        <para>.- This item opens up a much bigger question than that mentioned by the honorable member for Parkes. Under it rice grown within the Commonwealth might be&#39; utilized for starch-making purposes, and it would foe very difficult for the Customs authorities to decide, in a factory, whether the rice so used had been grown locally or had been imported. Of course, it would not matter very much, because rice for the purpose of starch-making is admitted free. But I would point out that what is known as &#34; laundry &#34; starch is made from rice, which is the superior article for- the purpose, for many reasons which I&#39; need not enumerate. But laundry starch can also foe made from wheat and maize. The proposal of the Government, if agreed to, will have the effect of making starch made from locally-grown maize  and wheat free, while an Excise of id. per lb. will be levied upon  starch made from rice, which is the favorite starch. </para>

                            <para>- At the present stage 1 do. Rice is about to be grown in Australia. We have already authorized the payment of a bounty upon its production. Why, then, should we exempt from Excise starch made from wheat and maize, and levy a duty of id. per lb. upon starch made from rice? The manufacturers of rice starch will be handicapped under this provision to the extent of id. per lb. That is a very serious proposal, and I do not think it is one to which the Committee will agree. As the law stands at present, if laundry starch is made from any material it is dutiable at id. per lb. I say that the proposed change ought not to be made. </para>

                            <para>- No one is more competent to pass an opinion on the subject than is the honorable member for Mernda, and if, as he says, a large quantity of starch is made in Australia from maize and wheat,- the present proposal means that maize starch is, by omission, to be given an advantage of id. per lb. as against rice starch, whilst it already has an advantage under the duty. The manufacturers appear to have discovered that starch made from rice is preferred by the public, since most of the starch manufactured is made from that article, and the Committee is therefore being asked to handicap the particular starch which the public require to the extent of at least id. in the shape of Excise duty. </para>

                            <para>- It is a peculiar state of things that an article which is on the free list as an import should when it has been imported be subject to an Excise duty. That, I should think, is a novelty. We are told that starch can be made from maize, and we know that maize can be imported at a duty of is. 6d. per cental, which is a great deal less than |*d. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly that is so. I think it is a serious question whether  we should encumber this industry with an Excise duty at all. In the whole range of Commonwealth manufactures I think there are only ten or twelve which pay Excise duties. I presume that the new protection would apply to the starch industry;, whether an Excise duty is imposed or not. </para>

                        (Macquarie)  &#39;&#91;9.32J.-  The Ministry have a laudable object in view, as they desire to promote the manufacture of starch from materials grown in the Commonwealth, but it seems to me that their object would be best accomplished by providing that starch made from imported materials should be subject to -an Excise duty of id. per lb., and if made from materials grown in the Commonwealth should be free from Excise duty. The fact that our manufacturers must use rice imported from abroad justifies its free admission for the manufacture of starch; but it does not excuse the Government from taking some steps to encourage the use of materials grown in the Commonwealth in this industry. The honorable member for Parkes spoke of the advantage which maize has at the present time, and his remarks would convey the idea common amongst honorable members of the Opposition, that because there  is a duty on imported maize, the price of locally-grown maize must be increased 1 We have combated that argument all along by showing that in the case of primary products a duty is not likely to make the commodity &#39;dear, whatever may be the effect of a duty imposed in connexion with secondary products. ;

                        <para>. - Before giving a vote on the amendment, I wish to know how the Committee stand with regard to it. In the early part of the year, some very strong evidence was given in the Victorian Appeal Court about the conditions of the starch industry here, and the rate of wages was fixed at 36s.&#39; a week. One girl then gave evidence that she was getting 9s. a week for wrapping up electioneering circulars for the honorable member for Mernda. If those are the rates of wages which the industry is going to pay, I am in favour of wiping it out altogether, and will certainly vote for an increase in the Excise. I am sorry that I was out of the chamber when the duty on starch was being discussed, because I intended to give the honorable member for Mernda a roasting in connexion with the evidence to which I have referred, which disclosed a scandalous state of things. Furthermore, the manager of Robert Harper and Company, in a letter to the newspapers, said that the free-trade members of this House had visited the factory, unknown to the management, to get evidence to use in connexion with the consideration of these duties. I asked in this </para>

                    <para class="block">Chamber whether the members of the Opposition had done so, and they all denied it, and the free-traders of the Labour Party also denied having done so. It was not necessary to go to the factory to get evidence; all that had to be done was to take the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> report of the proceedings in the Appeal Court. I wish to know from the Minister whether this industry will come under his new protection proposals. If it will not, I shall be ready to wipe it out, even if I have to stay here for a week. </para>

These words were adopted to give an inducement to manufacturers to use local materials, and I did not think that objection would be taken to them, even by the manufacturers of starch. I do not know the details of that industry, but I thought that Australian materials could be used by manufacturers. </para>

If starch can be manufactured from materials grown in Australia, whether rice, maize, wheat, potatoes or anything else, and such starch is free of Excise, the adoption of these words must confer a benefit on the local manufacturers of starch. </para>

                        (Mernda) &#91;9.44}- I am glad that, the Minister is open to argument upon this, point, and has admitted that he has not much knowledge of the manufacture of starch. Starch may be produced from rice, maize, or wheat; but the processes of production differ, and it would handicap the industry to impose a tax of id. per lb. on starch produced from rice. To produce starch from other material will require altogether new machinery. To require persons engaged in an industry which has been built up with the. encouragement of a duty of id. per lb. to purchase new machinery, and to engage in another process of manufacture, would be an extraordinary proceeding. I can only assume that in making this proposal the Minister did not understand the minutiae of the business. I think that paragraph

                            <para>- You, sir, will now observe that two or three honorable members thought that my amendment was carried. There was so much conversation going on that what really took place was not understood. You, sir, put the question as to whether the word &#34;rice&#34; should be omitted, with a view to inserting certain words, and I, and several other honorable members, understood that it was  omitted,  but it appears that you took it that the Committee decided that it should remain. I now propose the insertion after the word &#34;rice&#34; of the words &#34;or other materials, imported.&#34; </para>

                        <para>.- There was no distinction made between different starches in the last Tariff, and I do not think that a distinction should be made in this Tariff. How can the Commonwealth superintend the work in the various factories without incurring a lot of expense: If it is -desirable to prevent rice being imported for the manufacture of starch, let us impose a duty for that purpose, but do not let us have inspectors going into every factory, large or small, to see whether starch is being made from imported rice or materials grown in the Commonwealth. If we have done wrong in the past,&#39; do not let us do wrong in the future. Let us try to save expense if possible. I believe that it would be very difficult for ah officer to enter a factory and distinguish between starch made from imported rice and starch made from local products. When an Excise duty is levied upon the products of a factory the position is quite different. I intend to support the omission of the word &#34; free.&#34;- , . </para>

                            <para>- I admit that. Probably if there had not been an Excise duty the import duty would not have been fixed as it was. This afternoon I asked that there should be no differentiation in connexion with the factories. I suggested that if a factory were engaged in making starch from various materials it should be allowed to do so, and that a manufacturer should not be allowed to make starch from one material in one factory and from rice in another factory. I hope that the Minister will agree to adopt practically one line and so let us get on with items which are more important. I am informed by a firm of manufacturers in my electorate - Lewis and Whitty - that if the two lines are allowed to stand, their machinery which was made for the production of rice starch will become obsolete. The manufacturers say that locally-grown materials, if used, would produce an inferior starch. If they desire to make the best quality they should be commended, and Parliament should not place any obstacle in their way. I hope that the Minister will agree to an amendment if moved or move an amendment to leave the Excise on starch precisely as it was in the old Tariff, namely, rd. per lb. all round. </para>

                        <para>.- If we had needed an argument for carrying the amendment of the honorable member for Parkes it has been supplied by the honorable member for Yarra, because he has urged that if the manufacturers of starch used any material other than rice their machinery would become obsolete. He considers that, he is a strong protectionist, but what has he to say about the interests of primary producers who grow potatoes, maize, wheat, and other starch-producing articles? He has no primary producers of that kind in his constituency, and therefore they do not concern him one iota. Nor does the primary producer concern the honorable member for Mernda so long as he can get his own purse well filled, and can take what he can out of the pockets of the people, and out of the pockets of his employes too. The primary producer does not concern that honorable member a bit. That is the&#39; principal argument why in my estimation the amendment of the honorable member for Parkes should be agreed to. </para>

                        <para>.- It is very unfortunate that the honorable member for Mernda is rich, and therefore has these envious attacks made upon him. I am sorry that the personal element has been introduced. On the other hand, I think that the main attitude which the honorable member for Maranoa has taken up is quite right. If the manufacturers are not ready when the occasion arises to give a preference to Australian articles they are taking a very selfish view, which is not satisfactory to those of us who want to encourage all forms of Australian production. </para>

                            <para>- There are other articles which can be grown here. The Minister has mentioned three or four articles which may be used in the manufacture of starch.&#39; If by means of a preference we can induce the manufacturers to use an Australian product, it is only right that we should do so. The amendment moved by the honorable member for Maranoa will be the means of causing Australian products to be used by manufacturers who are heavily protected, and I shall therefore support it. If manufacturers alone were to be protected by this Tariff, many honorable members would not be prepared to support it. Our desire in encouraging our manufactories is that they should also improve the position of those engaged in primary industries by causing an increased demand for the raw material which they produce. </para>

                        <para>.- I am in sympathy with the object which the Treasurer has in view in separating these items. It should be our desire to see Australian products used, as far as possible, in Australian manufactures ; but, since both sections of the Tariff Commission are agreed as to the position we should take up, I cannot see why ,we should depart from the proposal previously made. It would be far better to have one consistent Excise duty. We are now face to face with one of the complications&#39; that arise where an Excise duty is not imposed for purely revenue purposes, and where the object in view could better be met by a proper adjustment of the Customs duty. &#91; should have preferred the imposition of a lower Customs duty without any Excise. </para>

                        <para>.- I  am unable to follow the reasoning of protectionists who ask for a uniform Excise duty upon this article. One of the objects of a protectionist Tariff is to assist the primary producers as well as the manufacturers of Australia. We have given more than reasonable consideration to the starch manufacturers by the admission of rice free from the imposition of Customs duty. We have now a proposal that starch made from rice shall pay an Excise duty of id. per lb., and that starch made from materials grown within the Commonwealth shall be free of Excise. The adoption of that proposal will offer a reasonable inducement to the local starch manufacturers to seek for raw material other than rice that can be produced in Australia. That is certainly desirable. The argument advanced against this proposal, primarily by the honorable member for Yarra, and supported by the honorable member for Mernda, that certain machinery would be put out of use by its adoption, offers no sufficient reason for failing to avail ourselves of an opportunity to encourage the primary producers of Australia to supply the raw material for this industry, instead of our having to import rice for the purpose. The best means of securing the object that I have in view is that of standing by the proposal in the form submitted in the printed schedule. </para>

                    <para>Amendment negatived.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. PAGE</inline> (Maranoa)  &#91;10.7&#93;.-  After the last division, I am quite satisfied as to the attitude of the Government towards the primary producers of this country. It appears to me that the man on the land is to have no consideration whatever. In Melbourne, where the Treasurer is surrounded  by  wealthy manufacturers, they can get his ear and the ear of his officers. But the farmers and producers, who are not present to give him the tip, cannot get any protection. All that the amendment of the honorable member for. Parkes meant was to give the starch manufacturers their rice free and to limit the Excise to any other material. We know from the evidence given before the Appeal Board in Melbourne how badly the starch manufacturers want protection ! If I had my way with them, they would get very little of it. I would shut every one of them up to-morrow, considering the wages they are paying. What do they care about the miserable hovels in which the employes live, as shown in the <inline font-style="italic">Lone Hani,</inline> so long as they can maintain their own palatial establishments? If the Government will not yield to the extent of giving the primary producer some protection, they will receive very little support from me in the future. </para>

                        <para>. - Many honorable members have expressed a desire to see this Excise duty of id. put upon starch of all kinds made in the Commonwealth, whether from materials imported or from materials grown in Australia. I propose to test the feeling of the Committee upon that point by an amendment, the effect of which will be to put starch upon the same footing as it occupied under the last Tariff, where there was no differentiation at all. I propose to impose an Excise duty of id. per lb. upon starch, no matter from what it is made. An honorable member, prior to the last division, asked me why we should have an Excise duty at all. I point out that when we were discussing the Customs duty, the Committee was told that the manufacturers had to pay id. Excise under a subsequent part of the Tariff, and that, therefore, the duty under consideration could not be dealt with without taking the Excise into consideration. A number of other honorable members- have shown a desire to impose an Excise of id. indiscriminately. I am prepared to join in that direction. We must remember that we are now considering the revenue of the country. We have given a high duty to the manufacturers of starch upon the supposition that they were going to pay an Excise of id. per lb. upon all that they manufactured. I propose that we should look after the revenue by making this Excise duty operate irrespective of the material. I therefore propose to move - </para>

                        <para>. - I should have preferred to impose a duty of id. per lb., and to have no Excise. In mv opinion, we made a mistake five years ago in adopting an Excise as against the original proposal for a simple import&#39; duty. However, as we have adopted an Excise, it seems that the differentiation between starch made from rice and starch made from other agricultural products gives an opportunity to assist our local primary producer, as suggested by the honorable member for Maranoa. The amendment just disposed of did not appeal to me as. likely to achieve anything, because an import duty of is. 9d. a cental is imposed on cereals, and also on potatoes from abroad, so that it is not probable that these materials would be used by any local starch- makers in view of the additional Excise duty. But the proposal which the Government have now placed before us does give a preference to the local grower of cereals or potatoes as against imported rice. I do not pretend to know anything of technical details, but I think we ought to give some encouragement, by means of a differentiation, of duty, to the manufacturers of starch from our own raw material. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member was voting to exactly the opposite effect ; and I shall test the honorable member when we come to deal with paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b.</inline> What. I am concerned with is the protection of the primary producer, and not the insignificant point raised by -the honorable member. Does the honorable member suppose that those who manufacture starch will import anything else but rice, in view of the fact that there is a duty on maize and all other similar material ? It was blank cartridge which was fired by the honorable member for Parkes. My desire is to see the primary producer protected. The question is not whether the industry of starch making can be carried on with the machinery that is here ; the question is whether we ought to encourage the production of raw material of some kind from which starch may be produced. The proposal I submit is consistent with the principle I have always advocated, but if the Committee do not choose to accept it, well, the matter is not of supreme importance. The revenue cannot amount to much, because there is not much starch made &#39;from any material grown in Australia. But the duty is proposed with a view to induce persons to grow rice for the purposes of the industry. This is not a revenue duty, but. absolutely the reverse, and must be regarded as a means of developing the production of our own ra,w materials. </para>

I am still of opinion that that amendment would, if carried, have protected the primary producer, so far as importations were concerned, because the words &#34; or other material imported &#34; covers the whole range of anything from which starch could be made. </para>

                        <para>. - The Government &#39;propose to levy almost a prohibitive duty upon this item. Saccharine, when used for medicinal purposes, is admitted free. Whilst I do not wish to see anything imported which is of an injurious nature I do not think that we ought to&#39; prohibit the importation of saccharine simply because it is used as a substitute for sugar. The individual who uses it medicinally upon every occasion that he drinks tea or coffee consumes more than does the individual who drinks it in aerated waters ; but we are allowing the one- and preventing the&#39; other. I am not prepared to say whether or not the use of saccharine is injurious. I know that doctors frequently recommend it. If its use is injurious the Government should prevent its local production, and an Excise duty of ^5 per lb., although it is a very heavy impost may not be&#39; absolutely prohibitive in an article of this kind. </para>

                            <para>- The most direct way would be to prohibit the manufacture. I should like to know whether the Minister is satisfied that the article is so injurious to health that its importation and manufacture ought to be prohibited, or whether this duty is proposed because its manufacture would be an interference with sugar. If it were only interference with sugar, I should be prepared to move that it should not be prohibited, but if the officers of the .Customs Department have come to the conclusion that the article is absolutely injurious to health, I would not raise the question. </para>

                        <para>.- In the case of every other item in connexion with which an Excise duty is imposed, the Committee has dealt with the import duty first. I know that the honorable members for Grey and Boothby, and, I think, the honorable member for Angas also, were waiting for this item when we were dealing with the item sugar. I believe that the Minister, at the time, said that he would take it in connexion with item  278.  I think he would do well to postpone this item until we have dealt with - the import duty under item  278. </para>

                        <para>. - What the honorable member has said is quite correct. I was not aware that honorable members who desired to discuss this item were absent. If the honorable member for North Sydney will look at item  278,  he will find that saccharine is included under &#34; Drugs and Chemicals,&#34; and is dutiable at  30s.  per lb. The importation of the article is not desirable, except for medicinal purposes. This is the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, who were very strongly against the use of the article except for medicinal purposes. This Excise duty of <inline font-style="italic">-?5</inline> is really a prohibitive duty. As I remember that some honorable members referred to it previously, and I said I would have it discussed in connexion with item  278,  I now move - </para>

                            <para>- I do not know what the law really provides, but Parliament should be informed of the legal position. We should be told whether the Minister can or cannot carry out the provisions of the Act. If he cannot,, he is not to be blamed because nothing so far has been done, and Parliament will be to blame if it does not pass an amending law. But the present condition of affairs is unjust to both employes and those manufacturers who are paying reasonable wages. I hope that the Minister will tell us why he is not collecting Excise from manufacturers who are not paying reasonable rates. The irritation and dissatisfaction which have existed for so many months should not be allowed to continue. </para>

                            <para>- The Act provided that manufacturers could obtain exemption on satisfying the Court that they were paying certain wages. They have done that, and have obtained, exemption, which they consider equivalent to a receipt for the Excise. The honorable member complains, probably with reason, that they are now evading the Act, and we are trying, to ascertain if that is so. We must satisfy ourselves on the point, but there has been no loss of time in endeavouring to do so. If it can be proved to the Department that the Act is being evaded,, every possible means will be taken to enforce its observance. </para>

He is unsympathetic, and would like to cause trouble; The manufacturers - whether of harvesters or of other things - who obtained concessions from Parliament on condition that they would pay reasonable wages, will get fair play from us, but no more. If some of them- are not paying proper wages, we shall do our level best to make them. </para>
