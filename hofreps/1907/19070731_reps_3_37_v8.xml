                        <para>- If I were to answer that question, it would cause more withdrawals. Some of those who are now withdrawing are "barking up the wrong tree," their action being altogether a speculative one. I cannot give any indication as to when I intend to bring forward the new Tariff ; I do not think that ray colleagues know when it will be brought forward. </para>

                <para class="block">That statement is absolutely incorrect. The words attributed to me are foreign to my political thought, contradicting my whole political life, and I have never used them: I hope that this great organ of public usefulness will take an early opportunity to admit its mistake. In Western Australia I supported protection to local productions and industries for many years, in opposition to tens of thousands of persons who, coming from Victoria and the other States, were in many cases protectionists, but changed their views, and became freetraders, when they found the changed conditions existing on the gold-fields. If I were to leave this statement unchallenged, it might convey a wrong impression to the people in the other States of the Commonwealth as to my way of thinking on fiscal matters. The statement is absolutely without foundation, and is not based upon any utterance, recent or otherwise, of mine. </para>

                        <para>- The question is not, I think, of a kind which is usually answered by Ministers. It is a question of my personal opinion on a matter of constitutional law, and not as to any official knowledge or official intentions which it is desired to have communicated to the House. Under the circumstances, therefore, I think it would be opposed to well-established parliamentary practice to offer my personal views on the question submitted by the honorable member. I would refer the honorable member to May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice,</inline> 10th edition, page 237 ; and to Bourinot's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Procedure,</inline> 3rd edition, page 435, where it is said, " Nor are questions usually put on matters which are at the time the subject of proceedings in the Courts or which involve a question of law."

Only one case has been found in Victoria where a messenger had been employed inadvertently to relieve a letter-carrier, but, in some instances, both in Victoria and throughout the Commonwealth, messengers deliver a few letters and other articles at places where the employment of letter-carriers for this purpose would not be warranted, and, as far as possible, this duty is confined to senior messengers, who are thus trained for promotion to letter-carriers. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the honorable member will not press his amendment. Palm oil is another of those commodities which can be produced with advantage in the northern parts of Australia, and in a scheme of bounties of this description, our desire is to encourage as much as possible the cultivation of products which will tend to the closer settlement of the northern portions of our continent with a white population. It has been pointed out by the honorable member for Parramatta, amongst others, that if we are justified in authorizing the payment of a bounty upon any products, it is upon those products that will tend to the development of the Northern Territory. </para>

                        <para>- They seem to be good. If the honorable member will look at the report of the State agricultural experts, he will see that palm oil is a valuable commodity. The palm itself will flourish in the Northern Territory, as well as in Queensland and the northern parts of Western Australia. It would be valuable, not only in our own markets, but for export purposes. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened very attentively to the Attorney -General in the hope that I might hear some justification for the retention of this item. But he has said practically nothing. He has merely expressed the hope that the Committee will agree to it upon the off-chance that the money so voted may be expended upon the encouragement of other commodities. Personally, I hope that the item will be eliminated in the interests of the Bill itself. Any honorable member who wishes well to an earnest effort to establish our tropical industries, whether for the purpose of peopling the far north  or  for the sake of the industries themselves, will promptly assist in deleting from the schedule all such items as this. We know absolutely nothing about palm oil. Even the State agricultural experts tell us nothing about it. The experts whom we have called in to guide us in these matters do not even know what is the price of the article. I will undertake to say that if a stranger were to enter this Chamber with- out knowing the antecedents of this measure, and listen to the reasons advanced by honorable members for voting away the taxpayers' money in this wholesale fashion, he would think that we were madmen. No reason has been adduced for the retention of the item, either by the Attorney-General or the experts. They merely express the pious hope that we shall afford palm oil the encouragement proposed for fifteen years. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose the Government argue that the amount is not large, and 'that it is not our money. "Why," they ask, "should we not throw a little of it away ?" Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been thrown away by this Parliament. Why not get rid of a little more? That seems to be the argument which is applied to many of these proposals. I trust that the Committee will eliminate the item under consideration. </para>

                    <para>.- I ask the Attorney -General to agree to postpone the consideration of this item till after the Tariff has been disposed of. Upon looking at the existing Tariff, I find that palm oil is already protected to an enormous extent. From the report of the State agricultural experts, I learn that the value of Lagos oil, which is, I understand, the best palm oil, at Marseilles, is 2s. per gallon. Under the existing Tariff a duty of1s. 4d. per gallon is levied upon that commodity, so that it is already protected to the extent of 66 per cent. If a protective duty of 66 per cent. will not start the industry in Australia, how can the paltry expenditure of £3,000 per annum be expected to establish it? </para>

                        <para>- If it is expended at all it will be in the manufacture of margarine. In these days, when we pay so much attention to pure foods, why should we offer a bounty for the production of an article which will afterwards be used in the manufacture of margarine? I find that the State agricultural experts advise that a bounty of 15 per cent. be granted to encourage the production of palm oil for a period of ten years. But the Government proposal is that the bounty shall be operative for fifteen years. </para>

Surely there are plenty of more profitable productions to which we can direct our attention.

In my opinion, the proposal which we discussed yesterday was preferable to this one. Certainly we should derive better returns from the breeding of Angora goats than we should from the production of palm oil. I merely wish to draw the Attorney-General's attention to the character of the industry which it is proposed to establish. </para>

                    <para>.- Upon this item I take up the attitude which I indicated in my second-reading speech upon the Bill. Speaking as one who wishes well to the principle to which the measure is intended to give effect, I say that it would be entirely in the interests of the Bill itself to eliminate not only this item, but several others specified in the schedule, and to devote the money which it is proposed to expend upon them to the encouragement of industries which have a reasonable chance of succeeding. We ought to offer a bounty only upon commodities the production of which will eventually have some chance of attaining the dimensions of a great industry. I need scarcely point out that the land, the cultivation of which the bounty upon palm oil is intended to stimulate, could be far more profitably put under a crop of some other kind. In my opinion, it would be better to eliminate this item, and to utilize in developing the cotton industry the money proposed to be expended in respect of it. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not think that the Ministry should complain if honorable members refuse to support this bounty, since the information submitted with regard to it is exceedingly scanty. The report of the experts does not indicate whether there isa reasonable prospect of a profitable industry being established as the result of the bounty. Assuming that the high prices now ruling continue, the return will be only £3 per acre, and an industry that will yield so poor a return is an insignificant one. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. It is improbable that anything like an expenditure of £3,000 per annum for a period of fifteen years is necessary in connexion with such an industry. If there were any possibility of a profitable industry being established as the result of the passing of the item, I should be prepared to support it, but we have no satisfactory information to guide us. A bounty for the encouragement of wattle-growing would be a more reasonable proposal. If wattle seed be scattered broadcast, and the areas so treated fenced off from sheep, at the end of five years an annual return far greater than could be obtained from this industry is secured. . The prospects of success in this case are too remote to justify the passing of the item. </para>

Palm oil, if produced in Australia, would be exported, but under the Pure Foods Act recently passed by the Imperial Parliament it could not be used as heretofore in the production of margarine, and consequently the prices obtainable would be seriously reduced. In these circumstances the oil would be shipped to the Continent, where it would be used in the manufacture of margarine to poison the poorest classes of the community. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope that the Minister will allow this item to share the fate of that relating to palm fruit. I am inclined to think that its inclusion in the schedule was due to a desire on the part of the Minister of Defence that peanuts should be used as bullets in connexion with the future defence of Australia. All the evidence we. have as to the growth of peanuts shows that the industry is of very little value, arid that their cultivation is somewhat of a nuisance. Peanuts were grown some years ago in New South Wales. </para>

The remarks made by the Attorney-General in support of the retention of the item remind me of the story of a great American humorist who, yielding to a request that he should conduct an agricultural newspaper, published as one of the chief items in his first issue the statement that those who planted pumpkins should be careful not to put more than one in each hole, and also advised that when gathering turnips care should be taken not to shake the trees. It seems to me that we are being called upon to submit to a lot of advice which comes within this category. I would ask honorable members not to agree to the granting of a bounty for the encouragement of such a trivial industry as the production of peanuts. </para>

But, one after another, he is surrendering the items to an. opposition which seems to strike him with astonishment. He asked, in effect, " Where are the protectionists of Australia"? Here are magnificent industries which, it is said, can be planted by the expenditure of a few thousands a year, and which would give employment to thousands and hundreds of thousands of settlers in the Northern Territory, where we. particularly desire to organize for the purposes of defence. What does the surrender by the Attorney-General mean? The only virile element of the Cabinet has left it. When we had the late Treasurer in office we had a gentleman who could put up a fight when occasion required ; but now that he has resigned we find, on the very next day, that in spite of extraordinary provocation, there is not the least suspicion of complaint in the vertebrate organization of the Government.

The sunflower does not require twenty years to mature, but can be grown easily, and yields an enormous and almost immediate return, with a profit of £12 13s. per ton. There is an element of great disappointment in this proposal. There are people now engaged in cultivating the sunflower; at any rate, in various gardens I have seen beautiful plots of the flowers. In my opinion, there is danger here, because I understand that the sunflowers have to be sent to a factory before the bounty can be earned. What will the grower of the sunflower do if he raises his crop and there is no factory to which to send it? </para>

                        <para>- People might clear all the forests of Australia and plant sunflowers ; but what would be the good if there were no factories? I hope that the leader of the Labour Party will come to the rescue of the Government. Is the honorable member going to allow this sort of thing to go on? He is generally the chief insurance of the Government; and is he going to allow Ministers to be trampled on in this way ? Is he going to allow this great industry .of the sunflower to be trampled upon by a number of gentlemen who have forgotten their protectionist creed, and by a Minister who has not the pluck to stand up for a flower which might shed beauty over the whole surface of .the Australian desert, and make even the transcontinental railway an assured success. Why should we allow this spineless conduct on the part of the Ministry ? I shall insist on a division. </para>

                    <para>.- When speaking oh the second reading I prophesied that when we reached the schedule, industries which had friends would be defended while industries which had no friends would be allowed to " go by the board " ; and apparently the latter is to be the fate of many of the items. When the leader of the Opposition expressed the hope that the Attorney-General would make a stand on this item, that, of course, was an invitation to him not to make a stand ; and although the honorable gentleman called upon, his protectionist friends rr&gt; assist him, he is now prepared to abandon the item. Of course, I am glad that by the action, of the Attorney-General a sum of £10,000 will be saved; but I am surprised that such an aesthetic young, gentleman as he is, and so much  resembling,  as he does,  Bunthorne,  of <inline font-style="italic">Patience</inline> celebrity, should have deserted the sunflower. It is remarkable that the Government should endeavour to whip up their protectionist supporters on an item of this character. Only the colour of the sunflower might furnish a reason for my voting for the item, but even that colour is not sufficiently attractive to earn my support. There is not a single industry represented in the schedule which could be advocated very strongly on the public platform ; and I am glad that the Ministry are awakening to some sense of responsibility, and are prepared to surrender this 'and other items. At the same time, I am sorry for the protectionist supporters of the Government who have had such a whipping from the Attorney-General in connexion with the sunflower. </para>

                    <para>.- Protectionist members -are placed in somewhat of a difficulty by the presence of two or three of what I cannot but call ludicrous items in the schedule. On the other hand, there are one or two items which protectionists would desire to see passed ; but if the Ministry do not abandon the sunflower gracefully and quickly, I am afraid it may be thought that the whole of the items are " going by the board." For  instance, the item of wool tops is a most valuable one, and I hope that it will not be swept away. I fancy some aesthetic member of the Ministry must have inserted this item, which is well-known to be the emblem of the aesthetic cult. I feel sure that attention has only to be called to the item to cause the Attorney-General to withdraw it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not deny it, but I understand that the object of these bounties is the encouragement of industries which will give employment to white labour. The need of providing work for white persons has been specially emphasized, and that point has been relied on more than any other to secure support for these bounty proposals. The last paragraph of the report states that it is open to doubt if the industry can be successfully exploited under Australian conditions - that is to say, under white labour conditions. If that be so, why waste money in the way proposed? If we must give bounties, let us give them for the encouragement of industries which have a chance of succeeding under Australian conditions, with the employment of white labour. </para>

                    <para>. - I was pleased to learn, when the right honorable member for East Sydney was in Queensland, that he was an advocate of the bounty system. While canvassing that State for protectionist support, and announcing his readiness to lead in Australian politics, he said that he was in favour of bounties. Therefore, I rely upon his support in connexion with this item, because I know that when he makes a promise he tries to fulfil it. A careful study of the report shows that rice can be grown successfully in Queensland and in the Northern Territory. </para>

Special reference is made in the report to the land available in the Queensland coastal districts, not only in the Southern district, at Pimpama, but also in the Northern district, near Cairns. The industry can be carried on by white labour, and will yield a profit. It is therefore worthy of encouragement, and I ask the Committee to negative the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - There is no doubt about the importance of the rice industry. I am not prepared to make a suggestion in regard to the rate of bounty per ton, as I do not know much about the industry, but it would be wise to give consideration to the suggestion of the right honorable member for East Sydney, and not only increase the aggregate amount payable, but spread the expenditure over a longer period. It seems to me that more than five years should be allowed for the establishment of this industry, and that a greater sum should be given for its encouragement. Of course, we must remember, as the right honorable member admitted, that it already is protected by a duty, and while that fact might well be allowed to govern the rate of bounty per ton, it should not affect the total grant, or the period during which the bounty would be payable. </para>

                    <para>Rice is also grown largely in the swamps of Southern United States - Carolina in particular - and is partially worked with white labour. A good quantity of rice is also produced by white labour in Northern Italy. </para>

                <para>The States of America in which rice is grown are: - North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, all within the black belt. The rice produced in Texas is grown in districts wholly within that portion of the country which is largely settled by negroes. Anybody who will take the trouble to study the question will find that the production of rice in the United States is almost exclusively confined to black labour. It is true that a certain quantity is cultivated there by the small farmers, but where its production has attained the dimensions of an industry it is almost entirely a black labour industry. Further, this commodity is grown there under the most unhealthy conditions. It is cultivated under similar conditions in Manchuria. The upland rice in Manchuria is grown by the cheapest labour in the world. The State agricultural experts have themselves condemned the proposal to grant a bounty to encourage the production of rice. At the present time a duty of 3s. 4d. per cental is levied upon that commodity, and will any honorable member seriously contend that the conditions surrounding Australian labour to-day are such as to induce the people of the Commonwealth to embark upon the production of rice as a national industry ? Of course there may be isolated cases in which it may be profitably grown. But what is the return which may be expected from its cultivation? I find that the average yield per acre from the whole of the rice-growing country of the United States is 20 dols., . or approximately £4.

That yield indicates what we might hope to obtain in Australia. The swamp country of Louisiana is eminently adapted to the production of rice. It is regarded as the best rice-producing tract in the world. There the average yield per acre is only 20 dols. </para>

                        <para>- Will the honorable member venture to say that the conditions governing the production of rice are the same as those surrounding the production of wheat? We know that where we have to employ labour to any extent we cannot produce wheat for anything like that return. Wheat can be profitably grown for such a return only in large open plains and with the aid of the most up-to-date machinery. Taking the yields obtained from rice in the United States, I say that there is not the slightest chance of the industry becoming successful under Australian conditions. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Franklin has said that the rice industry is entirely a black man's industry. I should like to ask him if the cultivation of maize, in India and other countries, is not, on the same showing, entirely a black man's industry.. Similarly, the market-gardening industry in this country is supposed to be a Chinaman's industry. But we know very well that a white man can produce vegetables profitably without resort to the methods which are adopted by the Chinese. As a matter of fact, anybody who has seen what are called the "paddy, fields " of Ceylon must have noticed the primitive methods of irrigation employed there - methods upon which the white man can improve. Ceylon is undoubtedly a rice country. The honorable member for Franklin has said that in America this commodity will yield a return of only £4 per acre, and he affirmed that while it might pay to produce wheat for that price, it would not pay to grow rice. I fail to see why it would not'. To my mind, there is no reason why the production of rice should not be encouraged in Australia. We have heard a good deal recently in connexion with the starch trade and the importation of rice. To encourage the manufacture of starch, after providing for the payment of a decent wage to the employes, we should certainly foster the production of the raw material. Much has been said about an inferior quality of rice, but I would point out that such rice might very well be used in the starch trade. It seems to me that all industries which a progressive people desire to encourage are alleged to have some drawback associated with them by those who are opposed to their establishment. If a commodity is produced by black labour under certain conditions they refuse to believe that it can be successfully produced by white labour, as was the case in the sugar industry. But, just as sugar has been produced by white labour in Australia, so will rice be similarly produced. I intend to support the item, because I believe that the industry can be made a profitable one, even if it returns only £4 per acre. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable . member for Franklin has emphasized certain facts which no doubt will induce honorable members to vote against this item. I do not intend to repeat the arguments which he has advanced. It is admitted that it would be only the poorest  class of labour which would be employed in the production of rice. It has been said by some of the supporters of the Government proposal that its adoption would lead to the employment of the aborigines. That in itself is an admission that the industry would not be carried on under standard conditions. With regard to the production of rice, I would point out that that commodity is consumed by all classes. It is, perhaps, the most healthy article of diet that we can obtain. If I thought that the operation of the bounty proposed would result in the production of a better quality of rice, or in a cheaper article, I would be inclined to support it. But nobody can seriously contend that the sum of £1,000 annually - which will cover an output of only 1,000 tons of rice - is likely to stimulate the production of that commodity. What is a thousand tons compared with the total consumption of rice in Australia? It is infinitesimal. I ask the Attorney-General whether the sum of £1,000 is not a scanty allowance in this case? Both the leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Labour Party have admitted that it is. That being the case, it will be only five years before those who have been induced by the promise of a bounty to embark upon the industry will be pleading for an extension of the term during which it shall operate. Then, others who have engaged in other enterprises will also come forward and urge Parliament to grant them a similar extension. That is an evil which we have to guard against. Consequently, I ask whether the operation of the bounty is positively to be limited to five years. The Attorney-General was very cute in appealing to the leader of the Opposition to support the item. He spoke of that honorable gentleman's work in Queensland. There is no doubt that the right honorable member for East Sydney accomplished good work there. Only one representative of that State occupied a seat upon this side of the Chamber during the last Parliament, whereas four of its representatives now sit in opposition to the Government. I can understand that the rice industry, if established in Australia, would particularly benefit Queensland. </para>

Industries that have no friends in the House can secure no encouragement. Every representative of Queensland is prepared to support a bounty on rice, and it is evident that whoever was responsible for the framing of this Bill considered the production of sunflower seed of more importance than rice cultivation, since he proposed a much larger bounty in respect of the first-named item. </para>

                    <para>.- In reply to the honorable member for Dalley, who has just stated that every representative of Queensland will support this item, I desire to say that, although I am a representative of that State, and rice has been grown in my electorate, I do not see my way to support this bounty. Like the honorable member for Bland and the leader of the Opposition, I think that the amount proposed to be appropriated for this purpose is so paltry as to be unworthy of consideration. It is. ridiculous to suggest that so small a bounty would encourage the production of thousands of tons of rice. The honorable member for Lang has referred to the statement in the report that 8 tons of uncleaned rice were produced in the Northern Territory some years ago. Although I have not the statistics at hand, I am able to say that prior to Federation we produced a fairly large quantity of. rice in Queensland. Shortly before the establishment- of the Commonwealth, however, the production of rice there fell away considerably. This was due, not to the Federal Tariff, but to other causes. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that it was found in the first place that it was not a profitable crop, and that some of the land that had been devoted to its cultivation could be used to greater advantage in the production of other crops. Although some rice was grown in swampy land, some, I believe, was produced on hill country, and at a place called Strathford, 5 miles from Cairns, a mill for the hulling and cleaning of rice was established. The rice treated there met with a good reception on the market, and realized satisfactory prices, but, nevertheless, as I have stated, its production fell away considerably. </para>

The proposal is so paltry that I do not think it would induce any one to devote to rice cultivation land that is capable of growing more profitable products.

                    <para>. - The proposal to encourage the local production of rice is a good one, but the Minister should be prepared to agree to at least £5,000 per annum being devoted to this object for a period of ten years. It is absurd to suggest that a bounty of £1,000 per annum for five years is sufficient. The proposals in regard to bounties on the production of palm fruit, sunflower seed, and other materials used for the production of oil, were ridiculous, and when the Minister said that he expected the protectionists in the Opposition corner to support him in his efforts to establish these industries, he seemed to lose sight of the fact that our primary duty is to protect the public purse. In moving that the Bill be read a second time, the Attorney-General practically said that we should have to agree to the Bill as it stood, or reject it. </para>

                        <para>- The remarks of the honorable member led me to believe that, like members of the Conference of experts, he was an expert only in theory. I have had the pleasure of coming in contact with two or three gentlemen who are thoroughly familiar with rice cultivation, and I have also seen rice growing in northern Italy, as well as in America. Whilst I do not pretend to be an expert, I know something of what I am talking, and have no hesitation in saying that the industry is one that, under existing conditions, and carried on by white labour, would yield returns twice as large as those obtained from the cultivation of wheat. We find that in Queensland they have had yields of rice equal to 60 bushels per acre, and that two crops instead of one can be obtained every year. That being so, honorable members ought to recognise that the industry is worthy of special consideration. We should not lose sight of the fact that it would give employment to a large number of persons. The proposals made by the Government in regard to a bounty on peanuts, &amp;c, and several other items in the schedule are a disgrace to Ministers, and should not have been introduced. We are here not to waste public money, but to protect the taxpayers, and it cannot be denied that some of the items in this schedule would involve an absolute waste of public money. While the Government might well give special attention to the growth of fibrous plants, bounties on the production of oils are unnecessary, for in nearly every case the oils mentioned in this schedule are simply by-products, and protective duties already apply to them. If we cannot grow the fibre we cannot produce the oil. and if we cannot give a bounty sufficient to encourage the production of rice on a commercial scale we should not give any at all. Experts have told me that one of the most important considerations in connexion with rice cultivation is the temperature of the soil in which it is produced. The temperature of the soil in Riverina, Victoria, on the Murray, and Queensland has been declared by experts to be suited for the cultivation of rice, and they have even gone so far as to urge me, with others, to support the establishment of rice farms on the Murray, the Darling, or the Murrumbidgee, where the conditions are admirably suited to rice production. I should like to know whether the Minister can see his way to amend this item by proposing that the bounty shall be increased from £1,000 to £5,000 per annum, and spread over ten, instead of five, years? We need an increased population, but we cannot hope to secure it by granting such a small bounty as that now under consideration. The amount proposed to be set apart for this purpose would be swallowed up in administrative expenses, and nothing would be left for those engaging in the industry. I would ask the Minister to consider my suggestion and submit such a proposal as would be calculated to lead to the establishment of a great industry. The imports of rice into Australia are valued at something like £250,000 per annum, and the industry is therefore worthy of our special attention. It is evident that this matter has never been considered by the Government from a commercial point of view. We are supposed as commercial men to see that public money is wisely expended, and not frittered away as it would be under this proposal. I ask the Attorney-General to reconsider the item, and to give the Committee an assurance that he will prolong the period and increase the bounty. This is an industry worthy of the support of this Parliament and of the people, because it can be established with white labour, as in America and in Northern Italy, and will prove of great benefit to the country generally. </para>

                    <para>. - In my opinion this item ought not to be supported, because it does not conform to either of the two requirements which are essential before the State expends money in the way proposed. It does not appear that rice is more profitable than any other crop; on the other hand, there are many crops now grown in Australia which are much more profitable, such as wheat barley, and oats. All these latter are produced under normal conditions without a bounty or aid of any kind, and are fast becoming, if they are not already, the staple products or the country. We cannot start a new industry like that of rice-growing under a bounty without deflecting capital from other industries already established. There may be industries, which, in their early stages, present enormous initial difficulties; but there does not appear any reason to believe that when the difficulties were overcome in the case of rice, any advantage would be gained. There is a great deal to be said in support of the argument that this is an industry which, though not always, is, generally speaking, carried on by black labour; and this is a fact which it is of no use our blinking. A bounty on the production of that kind of wheat which can be grown with a jo-inch or a  12-inch  rainfall would be infinitely more beneficial to the country than a bounty on the production of rice. There is no doubt that it is most desirable to encourage the growth of a species of wheat which would partially defy drought, and wholly defy smut and rust. Rice does not appear to offer any particular advantage to the grower ; and while I do not deny that it can be grown in fairly temperate climates, yet, if any argument may be adduced in its favour, it must be that it would tend to utilize the waste lands in the northern and north-western parts of Australia. I shall vote against the item, because it represents, in my opinion, an industry' not particularly desirable in this country. It would be much more profitable to send our wheat to China and Japan and receive rice in return, than to grow rice in Australia. There is reason to believe that the Chinese and Japanese may be induced to become wheat eaters instead of rice eaters ; and, to an extent, our wheat is making headway in their markets. </para>

                    (Brisbane) [4.20].- There is one patent fact which differentiates this item from those which the Committee, in their wisdom, have seen, fit to eliminate from the schedule. In the items which have been deleted, the amounts involved were trifling, and might easily be called paltry from an Australian point of view. It was shown in regard to those items that even when the whole of the Australian consumption had been overtaken, only comparatively small industries would be encouraged and brought into existence. In the case of rice, however, we have to face the fact that the product, to the value of nearly  £[250,000,  is annually imported into Australia; so that there is a huge margin of production which the most sanguine of us, probably, would scarcely expect to be overtaken in the next generation. I do, not agree with the honorable and learned member for West Sydney in the comparison he has drawn between the production of wheat and the production of rice. The Commonwealth, in its wisdom, has properly decided that the northern portions of this great country shall, if possible, be peopled by white men. On my recent visit to the Northern Territory I became aware of the fact that, although there are enormous areas which, from my point of view, are waste, barren lands, and the poorest description of pastoral country one could imagine, there are along the flats of the Adelaide River and other rivers, which flow north and north-west, large swamps extending back from one to five miles, which could only be utilized, apart from an enormous expenditure on draining and irrigation, in the production of rice. It is said that those black soil swamps are eminently suited for the cultivation of rice. The swamps are inundated to a considerable extent every year, and the rivers on which they abut are, for the most part, in the upper reaches' of fresh water very suitable for the purposes of irrigation. It is extremely desirable that we should do a.11 we can to induce white settlement in those parts of Australia; and for the reasons I have indicated I shall support the item. Reference has been made to the fact that rice was grown in Queensland ; but the cultivation was carried on under peculiar circumstances. At that time a duty of
                    <inline font-style="italic">£9</inline>
                    per ton was imposed on rice, not for the purpose of protecting the industry, but for the purpose of causing the Chinese population on the Palmer gold-field, who at that time numbered something like  20,000,  and who contributed very little towards the revenue, to pay their fair proportion of taxation. This was deemed the simplest way to reach them in this connexion, seeing that they were the largest rice consumers in the community. The duty, however, had the effect of largely encouraging the production of rice in the northern coastal districts, but, so far as my knowledge goes, the rice there cultivated was invariably in the hands of the Chinese. It is worth a trial to ascertain whether the river flats in the Northern Territory - which, so far as I could see, were the only agricultural lands in the coastal districts - can be utilized by white men for the cultivation of rice? I join the honorable member for Grampians in the regret that the bounty is not considerably in excess of the sum named, because if the industry is to be a success, it is1 worthy of much greater encouragement.

                    <para>. - I shall not occupy much time, because I take it for granted that honorable members have made up their minds how they intend to vote. This item of rice is not to be compared with the items of sunflower, peanut, palm, olive, and linseed oil, which have been deleted from the schedule. It is very difficult to understand why the Government, if they are . in earnest in their desire to establish the rice industry on a sound footing, should recommend or propose such a small amount as £5,000, or £1,000 per annum. As the honorable member for Grampians said, the bounty ought to be something like £50,000, because this is an industry which nearly every honorable member will admit is possible of being established on a prosperous basis. Last year the rice imported into Australia was worth £250,000 ; and we all know that rice is used as food by every man, woman and child in the community, lt has been said that this is a black man's industry, and that may be so; but the same might have been said of the sugar industry until recently. There is no doubt that the rice industry could be established throughout the Commonwealth - not only in Queensland, but in all the States. The honorable member for Grampians has told us that rice can be grown on the Murray and the Mumimbidgee, and doubtless there are many parts of Australia in which, with slight encouragement, it could be cultivated successfully. Another advantage of this industry is that there are two crops annually. The report of the experts states that the period before there is any return is six months at the outside, and, in favorable districts, five months ; and this in itself would be a great inducement to those inclined to engage in the industry. I shall be only too pleased to support the item, but I urge that the amount is not sufficiently large to achieve the object in view. </para>

                    <para>. - I view this as an ideal item in the schedule, because it presents those conditions which make it one of the most justifiable of the proposals before us. In the first place, the value of the imported rice approximates to £250,000 per annum, and, in the second place, this is a new industry which has not been exploited, and of which we may have reasonable anticipations that,  if  encouraged, it will be entered into with profit to the Commonwealth. The item of rice possesses possibilities which suggest themselves to my mind, and which are likely to commend this bounty to the whole of the Commonwealth. It has been pointed out that the experts have contradicted themselves to some extent by expressing a doubt as to whether the growing of rice is an industry which can lie successfully exploited under Australian conditions. Before committing themselves to a recommendation, they should have tried to satisfy themselves on this point. Their report is unsatisfactory for another reason. The success of the rice industry in Australia must depend largely on the extent to which machinery can be brought into use in connexion with its cultivation and harvesting, and the experts suggest that both varieties of rice may be harvested by the stripper as wheat and oats are harvested. They should have ascertained conclusively whether such harvesting is possible. If strippers could be used, there is very little doubt that the industry would prove a profitable one. </para>

                        <para>- In the Goulburn Valley irrigation is possible now. It has been urged that the amount set down for the proposed bounty is too small to allow of the accomplishment of satisfactory results. I agree with that view. We have been told that, in dealing with the schedule, we cannot increase it ; but we must recollect that we have a strong Government in power, and if the Committee is in favour of making a larger grant - say  .£5,000  a year instead of £[1,000 - no doubt Ministers will provide means for carrying its views into effect. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened carefully to the debate, and have been appalled by the ignorance of many honorable members on both sides of the Chamber in _ regard to the cultivation of rice. It is lamentable that proposals should be based upon a report like that before us, which contains so little information. I really wonder if the Minister is in earnest in regard to these proposals. The leader of the Opposition, who is known as the arch-priest of free-trade in Australia, has said that he will support the item, his only reason for doing so apparently being that in Queensland he promised certain protectionists that he would support the giving of bounties. I cannot follow him in this matter, because I do not believe at all in the bounty system, and I think that the proposed bounty would altogether fail. According to the report - </para>

                        <para>- I do not know of any place where there is a rainfall so regular that periodical inundations of rice-fields would be possible. Furthermore, rice is now produced almost solely in countries where labour is cheap. In Japan, the husbandman is ground down by his overlord, who takes every penny that he can pay, and even in Carolina black labour is employed, so that I think that Australia cannot compete with other parts of the world in the production of rice, because, though we may have the soil, we have neither the regular rainfall nor the cheap labour which are needed. I have seen rice growing in China in little terraces ascending the hills, which are irrigated very cheaply ; but in Australia any system of irrigation must be very expensive. It is to be remembered that rice is used, not only as an article of food, but also for tha manufacture of alcohol and starch, for which it must be available at a very cheap rate to make the process profitable. Even the experts admit that it is open to doubt if the rice industry can be successfully exploited under Australian conditions, and I think that I have shown that it is ridiculous to expect success. I hope, therefore, that the Committee, with the exception of the leader of the Opposition and the Minister, will vote against the proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to be in a position to support this proposal, because rice is such an important article of commerce, being used not only as a food, but for the manufacture of starch and other productions which employ a considerable amount of labour. But no words can adequately express the foolishness of setting apart only  .£5,000  for the encouragement of rice growing. If the industry is to be fostered, we must offer a sum from which we may expect good results. Some rice is being grown at the present time; but to offer  £[5,000,  to be given during a period of five years, to encourage more people to embark on the industry is, in view of the magnitude of our territory, simply ludicrous. I should like to know whether we cannot increase the amount set down by adding to it some part of the £[122,000 which we have saved by our amendments in the schedule. If so, I shall be glad to vote for the bounty, but if we cannot, I must vote against it, because I consider the granting of so small a sum as  .£5,000  merely farcical. In view of the importance of this matter, I think we should have an authoritative opinion from the Minister, or from you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> as to whether any part of the sum saved by our amendments in the schedule can be devoted to increasing the bounty for the production of rice. </para>

                        <para>- Only the  Chairman  can give an authoritative ruling upon that point. My own view is that when an Appropriation Bill has been approved, embodying specific appropriations, we cannot devote those appropriations to another purpose. At the same time, I feel sure that the honorable member for Kooyong will not vote against this item merely because he regards the sum as insufficient to encourage the rice industry. I would point out that under the Bill the Government have power by regulation to vary the amounts appropriated in connexion with the different items, either by increasing or decreasing them. In pleading specially for one or two commodities - when it was urged that they could not be grown in the Commonwealth - I said, *' Let the item stand, because if the money as not required for this specific purpose there are other items in the schedule, and by means of regulations which have to be laid upon the table of the House, we can increase the amounts appropriated." Increases can be made in that way. </para>

                        <para>- I speak subject to the ruling of the  Chairman.  Let me take the case of rice as .an example. If the proposal of the Government in that connexion be agreed to, it is quite possible that the £1,000 appropriated for the payment of the bounty will not be required during the first year of its operation. As a matter of fact, if ^£50,000 were appropriated, I do not think that £1,000 would be absorbed during the first year. In the second year, if only £500 were claimed, it would show that the industry was beginning to obtain a footing. But the Bill has been so framed that the amounts unexpended in any one year will be carried forward to the next year. Of course, we realize that some of our proposals are purely of an experimental character. When the scheme has been launched, if the experiments prove successful, the House will probably be afforded an opportunity to revise it. If it can then be shown that an industry has been started with _ fair prospects of success, but that it requires further assistance to establish it upon a permanent basis, I believe that Parliament will gladly grant that assistance. But I maintain" that the £5,000 which we propose to spend in an attempt to foster the production of. rice is sufficient to permit of experimental work being carried out, and to enable us to determine whether we shall be justified in granting further assistance to make the industry a success. I ask the honorable member for Kooyong not to attempt to make further reductions in this or any other item, because by so doing he will be limiting our power to vary the amounts specified in the schedule. When we have dealt with the schedule I will recommit clause 2 and ask the House to make a proportionate reduction in it so as to keep faith with honorable members in that respect. </para>

                        <para>- I stated previously that it would be necessary to recommit clause 2, because I know that a number of honorable  members would be strongly opposed to some of these items. That prediction has been fulfilled. The Attorney-General has alluded to the power which is vested in the Executive to vary the amounts appropriated in the schedule of the Bill. I have already expressed the opinion that that is a most dangerous power. I think that this Committee ought to know definitely what amount is to be allocated to each of these items. If the whole of the money voted for any particular purpose be not absorbed during the first or second year that the Bill is operative, I have no objection to it being expended in the third or fourth year, so long as the total sum appropriated is not exceeded. </para>

                        <para>- But I do not believe in the Executive having power to take money appropriated in connexion with one item and to disburse it in connexion with another. I repeat that the Committee should definitely know the obligations to which it is committed. The expenditure of £1,000 annually would, I believe, be regarded as a very trivial matter by any of the States. But it is folly for us to commit ourselves to any such expenditure in the hope that we shall assist in the establishment of a large national industry. I cannot avoid thinking that we are dealing with this matter in a retail, paltry,  huxtering  fashion. Let us endeavour to establish industries which will be worthy of support by the Commonwealth and which are likely to prove of benefit to the people as a whole. Do I understand, sir, that no amount appropriated in the schedule for a specific purpose can Be used for the purpose of increasing other sums which have been agreed to by this Committee ? We have already reduced the total expenditure proposed by the Government by £[122,000, and I understand that whatever may be the amount of the expenditure agreed to in the schedule that sum must not be exceeded. Is that so? </para>

It is not in the power of the Government to appropriate the amounts proposed in respect of those items to any other item.

                    <para>.- In my opinion this is one of the items most deserving of the support of honorable members. 1 complain, however, that the amount: which it is proposed to appropriate for the purpose of assisting the rice industry is altogether inadequate. No sound arguments have been adduced in opposition to the bounty. The fact that the commodity is chiefly grown by black labour proves nothing, because we know that in India a very large quantity of wheat is grown by black labour. Yet in Australia we compete against that production with very satisfactory results. The honorable member for Hunter has stated that rice will not grow unless rain falls at regular intervals soon after it has been planted. If that be so, why is it that so much rice is cultivated upon the Nile, where very frequently rain does not fall for two or three years ? As a matter of fact, that rice is produced by means of irrigation, and I would point out that in South Australia there are huge areas of swampy land adjacent to the Murray - tens of thousands of acres - which should be eminently suited to the production of commodities of this kind. I have seen these swampy lands, and I believe that if we could only establish the rice industry in Australia, we should be conferring a great benefit upon our people. But when we come to consider that a sum of ,£5,000 has been proposed to foster the production of peanuts, it does seem that the amount which it is proposed to spend upon the encouragement of rice production is ridiculously small. I should like to see that amount increased to .£[10,000  annually.  An expenditure of £1,000 per annum is a very small bait with which to catch an industry which is worth £[250,000 annually. </para>

It should be impossible for the Government to vary any bounty except by way of a reduction. If the Minister responsible for the administration of this measure be empowered to increase the maximum, payable as bounty on any goods, we may have a very large bounty granted in respect of some of these items. The fact that the regulations under which this would be possible must be laid upon the table of the House affords some protection, but such a method of procedure is sometimes abused. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not like to allow this item to pass without entering my protest against it. The Attorney-General has put before us a report by gentlemen whom he described as experts. When that report agrees with any of the proposals of the Government, he tells us that it is worthy of consideration; but when it does not, I presume that he asks us to ignore it. I find in the report of the experts the statement that - </para>

                <para class="block">We know that coffee production in Ceylon has almost disappeared as an industry, and that those engaging in the industry in countries where the cheapest labour is available find it almost impossible to make a living. In South America, whence the bulk of coffee comes, a market cannot be found for all the berries at present being produced, and in the East Indies planters have had a similar experience. If the Commonwealth desires to undertake experiments in the production of coffee a start should be made in Papua, where the conditions essential to its successful cultivation prevail, and an abundance of cheap labour is obtainable. I am sure that the industry could not be conducted on the mainland under ordinary Australian labour conditions. I hope that the item will be rejected, and that honorable members will not consent to such proposals being carried on the voices. Such an appropriation as this would be absolutely useless. </para>

                    <para>.- In connexion with this, and nearly every other item with which we have dealt this afternoon, we have evidence that the Government have been seeking to attain too much. A fatal objection to the Bill is that, according to the report of the experts, many of the industries sought to be encouraged under it are not likely to be successfully established. That being so, we are simply asked to agree to a wasteful expenditure. The consumption; of coffee is declining, and the report of the experts by no means encourages us to support this item. The reason why the Government propose to appropriate only £5,000 for this purpose is apparently that the experts discovered that the prospects of success were so remote that it would be unreasonable to recommend a larger appropriation. I trust that this item, as well as others in the schedule, will not be allowed to pass without a division being taken. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Committee will agree to this item. It has long since been demonstrated that the finest coffee can be produced by white labour in Norfolk Island, which, until recently, was under the administration of New South Wales. In Lord Howe Island, excellent coffee can also be produced by white labour. One of these islands is already under the control of the Commonwealth, while the other may possibly be transferred to us at no distant date, and the fact that coffee of excellent quality can be produced by white labour on both  of them should be sufficient to induce honorable members to agree to this bounty. </para>

                    <para>.- It is all very well for the honorable member for Riverina to assert that coffee can be produced on Norfolk Island, but the fact remains that in Brazil and other countries where coffee is extensively cultivated the supply is more than equal to the demand. The report of the experts shows that large quantities of coffee berries have been destroyed by the planters in Brazil because of the low prices prevailing, and that the yields there have been almost sufficient to supply the world's demand. It would be of some interest to inquire into the history of coffee. I do not know whether Ministers appreciate the danger that might possibly attend the cultivation of coffee on a large scale in Australia. It is  really  a serious matter. </para>

                        <para>- The question is one of concern, not only to medical men, but to the public generally. In the dark days long antecedent to those of which we have authentic records, coffee was grown in Abyssinia, and its cultivation spread gradually to Arabia, where it was used by the Mohammedans in connexion with their religious exercises. The Mohammedans found that its effects enabled them to sustain their prolonged religious exercises without falling asleep; but even in those days the sectarian issue was raised, and some of the more orthodox of the Mohammedans objected very strongly to the drinking of coffee in connexion with religious devotions. Its use, however, became more and more popular. Coffee was brought to England in 1641, and we are told that in 1652  Pasqua Rosee,  the Greek, servant of an English merchant,  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwards,</inline> prepared it so palatably that many friends visited his master on Sunday afternoons to partake of the beverage ; so much so that Rosee was at* last advised to establish a coffeehouse of his own. He did so, and coffee-drinking became' so popular that many other coffee-houses were established in London. These coffee-houses were largely patronized by people who were opposed to the Government, and, so serious did the position become that Charles II., in 1652, issued a proclamation, in which it was stated that the houses were the resort of " disaffected persons, who devised and spread abroad divers false, malicious, and scandalous reports to the defamation of  His </para>

                        <para>- In Brazil, coffee plants are being uprooted because there is practically no market for a large portion of the coffee produced, and coffee bushes are giving way to other forms of cultivation. In Ceylon, the coffee plants were, I believe, rooted up because of serious pests, which may be introduced into Australia unless we very quickly pass the Quarantine Bill. Efforts are being made to encourage retired Indian officials to settle in Australia with their wives and families ; and it is highly probable that some of the ladies may bring out as pets specimens of that rodent known as the  golunda  rat. This is an animal which plays great havoc with the coffee plants, living chiefly on the roots, but also climbing up and devouring the berry ; and I believe it was the presence of this pest which caused a good many of the plants to be rooted up. In Ceylon there is also a pest known as the coffee bug, and there are certain fungoid pests, together with the coffee leaf disease, and coffee rot. In the report of the experts it is distinctly stated that four years must elapse before the coffee plant becomes productive. As a matter of fact, the plant is actually productive in the second year, and in the third year there is a profitable crop. Furthermore, the cultivation of coffee requires a large amount of cheap labour, which is employed in the countries where the industry is profitably carried on. There is no such cheap labour in Australia, nor, I am glad to say, is it very likely that there will be for a very long time to come. The cheap labour is required because there is a lot of weeding and pruning in connexion with the cultivation ; unless the plant is constantly attended to, It cannot possibly be successfully grown. I doubt whether there are many localities in Australia where the industry could be undertaken with any hope of profit. Coffee is said to grow well in well-drained, loamy soil,' at an elevation of about 2,000 feet, but there are very few such areas in Australia convenient to market. Most of the cultivated lands are in the coastal regions, because further back there is difficulty in reaching market. I hope honorable members realize that this is not an industry which ought to be encouraged at the present time with a bounty. In addition to the other reasons which I have given, I may point out that coffee is not so popular in England as it used to be. </para>

                    <para>.- This item is somewhat in the same category as the item of rice. The experts, who, I think, are responsible in a large measure for the item now submitted to us, tell us that the coffee plant does not reach the bearing state for four years. As the bounty extends for only eight years, there will be only four years in which it will operate. However, the honorable member for Hunter says that the coffee plant bears profitably in three years, and if that be so, the operation of the bounty is extended. Parliament owes some consideration to the coffee-growers, because of the manner in which their product was treated when the Tariff was before Parliament a few years ago. The duty under the Queensland Tariff was 4d. per lb., but that was reduced to 3d. by the Commonwealth Parliament under the uniform Tariff . In 1895 there was practically no coffee grown in Australia, beyond that produced by a few farmers for their own use. Five years later, in 1900, under a duty of 4d. per lb., in Queensland, some 200,000 lbs. was placed on the market, and it proved of such quality as to meet with the approval of all who used it. Then there came the uniform Tariff, which so affected the industry that in 1903 the production had fallen to 83,000 lbs. If the item be passed, it will mean that only a very small amount will be paid until the new crops are gathered, because I doubt very much whether at the present time 83,000 lbs. is produced, seeing that the production has been diminishing ever since the decrease in the duty. I should like to refer honorable members to a letter written to the <inline font-style="italic">Geraldton Sentinel</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Leonard</inline> M. Cutten, of Bicton, Clump Point, in reference to the coffee industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutten</inline> was the owner of the largest coffee plantation in Australia at the inception of Federation, and occupied that position, at any rate, for a year or two later. In the course of his letter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutten</inline> says -  . . It was largely due to the representations I made to the senators, and through the press, that the present inadequate duty was retained. That it did not suffice to save the coffee industry from extinction was not my fault. Without entering into wearisome figures it should suffice when I state that the Bicton coffee plantation, at that time the largest in Queensland <inline font-style="italic">(vide</inline> report <inline font-style="italic">Agricultural Journal)</inline> is at present being used as a horse paddock. De Moleyn's plantation (Cairns), the most complete, was, after ruining two proprietors, sold for one-fourth cost of machinery and sheds. These facts speak more strongly than words. </para>

                        <para>- That only strengthens my argument. Owing to the action of this Parliament in reducing the duty from 4d. to 3d. per lb., the industry has been almost completely extinguished. Notwithstanding what has been said by the honorable member for Hunter, this industry has always been carried on in Queensland exclusively by white labour, and it has proved a paying industry under that condition. The industry was prospering very well until the imposition of the lower duty. I hope that the item will be carried, although I think that the sum set down, like that set down for the encouragement of rice-growing, is inadequate, and the time allowed too limited for the revival of the industry, which flourished so greatly a few years ago. </para>

                    (Boothby) [532JFrom the remarks of the honorable member for Herbert, I think that the best way to encourage the production of raw coffee is to make the duty 4d. per lb., which he says was the Queensland rate. The only information we have in regard to the prospects of coffee-growing in Australia is that with which he has supplied us, and a report of agricultural experts which has been furnished to us, than which nothing could be more condemnatory of the proposal we are considering.

                    <para>It is undeniable that coffee of a good quality can be produced over large areas of the tropical and sub-tropical portions of the' Continent.  The returns, however, from the plantations, are not at all alluring, while the consumption of coffee by the people of the Commonwealth is on a very slender scale. The experience of the chief coffee producing countries of the world, and these are countries where an abundant supply of cheap labour is obtainable - does not afford much hope for the extensive and successful exploitation of the industry under Australian conditions. </para>

                    <para>It is also an ominous fact that according to the <inline font-style="italic">Tropenpflanser</inline> - a recognised authority on all tropical matters - the planters of Brazil have not only destroyed large quantities of coffee berry because of the low prices prevailing, but have also pulled up the bushes growing on large areas of coffee plantations, and are using the land for other purposes. </para>
                    <para>The records available of Australian experience in coffee growing are by no means encouraging. In the year 1903 there were 318 acres under coffee in Queensland, the total yield being 83,632 lbs. Valuing this at gd. per lb. - which is allowed to be a fair average price - the return would not be more than <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> per acre. Considering the labour involved in clearing and preparing the land, in picking and cleaning for market, and bearing in mind the fact that the plantation does not become productive until it is four years old, this return appears totally inadequate. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry that the honorable member for Boothby, who, I know, keenly desires to encourage agricultural industries, has made the remarks which have fallen from him. The fact that the coffee industry has flourished in Brazil is not a reason why we should not try to establish it here. Would he contend that because industries are prospering in, France, Germany, or England, we should take no steps to establish them here ? The test to be applied to this proposal is contained in the question, " Is there in Australia a market for coffee? " Undoubtedly there is, our importations being valued at £58,000, and it is well known that we do not get genuine coffee, because adulterants are largely used- It being granted that there is a market, we should ask ourselves, " Can we grow coffee in Australia?" It is not to be denied' that coffee can be grown successfully here. The reports show that it grows well in Queensland, from' Cairns right down to Maroochy, near Brisbane. Speaking from' memory, I believe that a sample of coffee produced in the Brisbane  district obtained a gold medal at one of the continental exhibitions. The industry is one which pays white men's wages. </para>

                        <para>- Coffee has been grown under commercial conditions not far from Bi  Brisbane,  and the picking of berries is work that cannot injure women or children. There is in Australia a large market for coffee, and we have1 a big area of country on which it can be successfully cultivated under conditions which make the cultivation a white man's industry. </para>

                    <para>.- When I was previously addressing the Committee I forgot to refer to the report of the Queensland expert with which the Attorney-General has so kindly presented us. The honorable and learned gentleman said just now - and his speech struck me as being a most feeble attempt to bolster up a preposterous claim - that the fact that the coffee industry was flourishing in Brazil was no reason why we should not seek to establish it in Australia. As I understood the remarks of the honorable member for Hunter, the point which he made was not that the industry was flourishing in Brazil, but that the demand of the whole world was already supplied, and that Brazil alone produced sufficient coffee to supply that demand. If there be no market for our produce, what is the use of endeavouring to bolster up this industry either by an expenditure of £1,000 or £12,000? The honorable member for Herbert has referred to the condition of the industry in Queens-' land. But I would point out that the report of the Queensland expert states - </para>

Here we are asked to vote a sum of money, not to enable our male adults to secure a livelihood, but to encourage the employment of women and children. My vote will not be given to encourage a policy of that kind. Seeing that the honorable member for Herbert is so anxious that women and children should be employed in this industry, I would specially direct his attention to the report of the experts. They say that it is essentially a tropical industry. Would the honorable member like to see his wife and daughter engaged in an industry of this character under a tropical sun for eight hours a day ? If he would, I certainly would not. It is bad enough when men of strong constitutions are forced to engage in occupations which require them to be exposed all day to the vertical rays of a tropical sun.

                    <para>The records available of Australian experience in coffee growing are by no means encouraging. In the year 1903 there were 318 acres under coffee in Queensland, the total yield being 83,632 lbs. Valuing this at 9d. per lb. - which is allowed to be a fair average price - the return would not be more than <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> per acre. Considering the labour involved in clearing and preparing the land, in picking and cleaning for market, and bearing in mind the fact that the plantation does not become productive until it is four years old, this return appears totally inadequate. With, all these disadvantages, the fact remains that coffee of a good type can be produced over large portions of northern Australia, and accordingly a bonus of id. per lb. for eight years is recommended. </para>

                    <para>.- I have heard many speeches from the honorable member for Lang similar to that which he has just delivered. One of the arguments which he has advanced against the proposal of the Government is that coffee is grown in a tropical climate, and that the employment of women and children in coffee plantations, when the sun was directly overhead, would be attended with more danger than if the sun were at another angle,  As  a matter of fact, we all know that most clanger is to be apprehended when the sun is low down. But some excuse is bound to be urged by those who know nothing about this subject, but who are consumed by an ignorant prejudice- against the employment of white labour. in sub-tropical industries. They have a stupid, ignorant conceit that certain things cannot be done, simply because they are not done. What is the statement made by the honorable member for Lang? That Brazil produces sufficient coffee to meet the world's consumption of that commodity. Could it not be said, with equal force, that the world's supply of iron is produced outside Australia, and that we should not, therefore, expect the Commonwealth to produce it in competition with other countries? I could cite dozens of industries that are in exactly the same position. </para>

The reason why coffee is not more largely grown in the temperate parts cf Australia is that the public have a prejudice against the local article. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Compared with the work that has co be performed by young people in various factories, the gathering of coffee berries during the time ot the year when their collection takes place is mere child's play. I trust that we shall approach the consideration of this item with unprejudiced minds. The industry in the Commonwealth can be expanded, but I do not know whether a bounty of id. per lb. will be sufficient to cause its expansion. </para>

I am not here to say that women are incompetent to perform light outdoor work. I have seen women engage in such work with profit to themselves and to their country, and I hope that honorable members will not be led away by the statement of the honorable member for Lang. The honorable member for Hindmarsh has said that since the industry is already established in Queensland, we should not grant this bounty. If the industry is established, the argument is a good one. </para>

                        <para>- That is true. I have seen small coffee plantations at various points between Cairns and Brisbane, and I repeat that their non-success has been due to the prejudice of the people against the local production, a prejudice due to the fact that a taste for the imported article has been acquired. In a small district to which I have already referred, a man is growing coffee, turning it into the manufactured article, and supplying two-thirds of the people in that district. </para>

                        <para>- The slightest difference in flavour is noticeable. Local manufacturers can produce something tasting very like the imported article, but cannot send out anything so near to it as to be able to capture the market. The fact that in the district to which I have referred two-thirds of the people are using locally-produced coffee is, however, an evidence that the product can be successfully raised in Australia, and I trust that it will receive the proposed slight modicum of assistance, in the shape of a bounty. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to reply to a statement made by the Attorney-General as to the employment of women and children in out-door occupations. I certainly think it is very sad that we should be asked to legislate to encourage an industry which will lead to the out-door employment of the mothers of future Australians, and to that of the children themselves. The question of whether those engaging in the gathering of coffee berries will  have to work under the vertical rays of a tropical sun is immaterial ; the point is that a mother's place is in her own home. Will any one say that her place is beside the plough in the field with her husband? It may be said that the work of picking berries is mere child's play. It is nothing of the sort. No task that must be performed is play. Time spent in this way by children could be better devoted by them to- </para>

                        <para>- It would be better for Australia if all the wives knew how to cook. Fortunately, many of them do, but the time of our womenfolk would be much better spent in making themselves proficient in such occupations than in working in the fields. The other day I saw a number of lads who ought to have been playing in the cricket or football field, or, at all events, going to school, working at what was nothing more nor less than the hardest' labour that could be devised for them. They were doing their eight hours a day at this. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. As a matter of fact, the Labour Party have always upheld the view that, if possible, we ought to encourage the production of goods by men rather than by women and children, but that, if women and children have to be employed, they should, at least, enjoy decent conditions. For honorable members who refused to extend to working women and children the only possible protection, to now object to their engaging in such occupations as that under discussion, is little short of hypocrisy - pure humbug. When I previously addressed myself to this item, I spoke on the authority of the evidence placed before us in the report of the Conference of experts; and on that evidence we are not justified in voting for this item. It has been contended that it is no argument against the establishment of this industry in Australia to say that there is over-production in Brazil. That, of course, is quite true ; but, according to the report, the experience of other countries is not encouraging, and, as to Australia, the report points to the impossibility of a payable industry being established here. I am anxious to support this item if a case can be made out for it, but no convincing case has as yet been placed before us, though the remarks of the honorable member for Herbert certainly showed some ground for an increase of the duty. All the work set forth in the conditions of the bounty has to be undertaken for a return, at the outside, of £10 an acre. In order to meet the fact that the industry does not now pay, it is proposed to grant a bounty of1d. per lb. for, practically, four years, seeing that it takes that time for the plant to come into bearing. The bounty might result, possibly, in more coffee being planted ; but eight years from now, when the bounty would cease, there is no doubt that the industry would sink to its present level. </para>

                    <para>". - I agree very largely with both what the honorable member for Boothby and what the honorable member for Hunter have said, and the good sense of the Committee should be against this item. The report of the Conference of experts is distinctly against the probable success of the industry in Australia; and the bounty would be a waste of public money. Twenty-five or thirty years ago Ceylon produced coffee, but the plantations were swept away by disease. Coffee-growing had to give place to tea cultivation; and Ceylon is now one of the largest tea-producing countries in the world. Whatever may be the fact as to this being a black man's industry, we do not desire to encourage any calling in which women and children are to be employed. However, I agree with the honorable member for Boothby that if women and children have to be employed in any industry, the conditions ought to be the best possible. It is evident to me that this item has not been carefully thought out by the Government. Certain conditions should have been imposed regarding planting, and so forth, because, otherwise, the planting would be carried on only for a few years in order to obtain the bounty. Iri Queensland, in 1903, there were 318 acres held under coffee cultivation, whereas in 1905 there were 167 acres; and, yet, in spite of the fair chance offered by the duty, the industry, instead of flourishing, has declined. This industry is similar to the rubber industry ; and I am sorry to know that the item in connexion with the latter has been adopted, because that is really a black man's work. I hope the Government will reconsider many items in the schedule, and that they will not persist in the proposal before us. If the item is not withdrawn, I suppose the Committee must divide, and, if so, I shall vote against it. There ought to be an agricultural bureau capable of giving the best expert advice, in order that success may be achieved in the various industries. </para>

                    <para>. - I 'understand the purpose of the Bill is to grant bounties in order that it may be ascertained whether certain industries can be established on a paying basis in Australia. If I am right in that assumption, the coffee industry does not comply with the condition, because the report of the Conference of experts shows that coffee can be grown in this country. In 1903 there were 318 acres under coffee cultivation, yielding 83,630 lbs. per annum. Doubtless coffee can be grown in Australia, but, in the absence of a bounty, there is not sufficient encouragement, owing to the fact that Australian coffee, apparently, cannot compete with the cheap labour coffee of other countries. I am totally opposed to establishing any industry which depends on the labour of women and children. </para>

I desire to see industries established that will afford employment to so many men that women will not be dependent on laundry or similar work, and will, in any case, engage only in occupations in which they will be fairly remunerated. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but under entirely different conditions from those which prevail in domestic service to-day. I should be very sorry to see any daughter of mine engaged in domestic service where she would be compelled to work at all hours for inadequate remuneration. The production of coffee is a cheap-labour industry, which experience has shown to be confined practically to women and children at what is anything but a proper wage. What has been shown is that coffee may be grown under conditions of which I do not approve. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Committee will not agree to the item. Like the honorable member for Boothby, I fail to see that we have been given any good reason for supporting this proposal. Indeed, if anything were needed to condemn it, it is furnished in the report of the Conference of experts. We should consider very carefully any proposal to encourage, at the expense of the taxpayer, industries in which chiefly women and children will find employment. The honorable member for Boothby accused the Opposition of showing a new-born anxiety for the welfare of the women and children of the Commonwealth; but surely that is better than anxiety to bring about their employment in tropical industries like coffee-growing? He was hardly just when he inferred from our action in preventing certain agricultural industries from being brought within the scope of the Arbitration Act that we had no sympathy with the women and children employed in them. Our action was taken for specific reasons, which were given at the time, and of which the House, in its wisdom, approved, and it was disingenuous for him to try to make political capital out of it. The Minister tried to lure the honorable member for Hunter into a trap. </para>

But on this occasion he hardly treated my honorable friend fairly. There is a great difference between field labour in the temperate parts of Australia and field labour in the tropical and sub-tropical regions, where alone coffee can be successfully grown. The growing of coffee for commercial purposes has been tried, and has failed. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but we should try in a direction in which success is a reasonable expectation. Why should we grow coffee at a loss, when more than the world's requirements is already produced in other tropical countries ? Surely there are better outlets for the energies of our people than an industry which, if successful, would lure women from their proper occupations into field labour in tropical Australia. The debate on this item furnishes a good argument for the establishment of a Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau. We have been informed that coffee failed in Ceylon because of the appearance of a disease which the growers were unable to check. </para>

                    <para>. - I did not intend to prolong the debate, but I feel compelled to do so, because of the many erroneous statements which have been made concerning the possibilities of coffee-growing in Australia. Some honorable members have doubted whether the industry is established, others whether it can be established, and others whether it is worth establishing. The House decided, without a division, that the giving of bounties for the encouragement of certain forms of production is advisable. But certain honorable members contend that coffee-growing is not an industry which should be encouraged in this way. It has been stated that coffee has been grown successfully only in the tropical parts of Queensland ; but, as a matter of fact, it has been grown very successfully in the  electorate which I represent. No doubt many honorable members have had the pleasure of visiting the Clarence River district, and know its soil and climatic conditions. Its climate is as healthy as that of any part of New South Wales, and we can be proud of the manner in which the farmers there live, and bring up their children. But the most successful men on our northern rivers do not carry all their eggs in one basket. They do not think it well to grow maize, or sugar-cane, or make butter only, because mixed farming is found to pay better. Coffee is sometimes grown as an auxiliary to a staple crop, and, as an instance of what is being done, I propose to quote from an article entitled, "Coffee Growing on the Clarence," which appears on page 283 of the March number of the <inline font-style="italic">New South Wales Agricultural Gazette</inline> for 1903. There is no higher agricultural authority in Australia than that publication. </para>

                    <para>From accounts to hand, it would appear that coffee growing on the Clarence River has passed the experimental stage, and that the industry is on a fair road to commercial success. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Dale some eight or ten years ago secured certain rights from the Government to found an experimental station at Wolbin Island. There he planted out several acres of young trees, which are now in full bearing. Already he has harvested 30,000 lbs. of berries, and has still another 10,000 to gather. This means that each tree's yield is from 50 lbs. to 60 lbs., or fifteen 1-lb. tins of the prepared article. Retailed at 1s. per tin, the revenue represents a handsome income, as the trees are planted in rows about 20 feet apart. At this rate, and providing that a market can be secured for the product, the industry, on the same basis of success, ought to give returns much more handsome than any of the sub-tropical crops raised on the north coast. The drawback to farmers used to returns ranging from monthly to yearly, is that there is no yield from the coffee trees till they are four years old, and then they are not in full bearing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bale</inline> has for many years devoted much of his time to crop experimenting. He has demonstrated that many crops, other than those now raised, can be profitably cultivated on the fertile Clarence as commercial ventures. Besides raising the coffee in its raw state, he has also roasting appliances and modern grinding machines, and turns out the coffee in labelled tins ready for the market. In the latter end of 1896, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bale</inline> submitted samples of his locally-grown coffee to the Department of Agriculture. The samples were brought under the notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> Skelton, who had been engaged for seventeen years as a coffee planter in Ceylon. He was greatly impressed with the quality of the berries, and some months afterwards, under arrangement, visited the Clarence and other northern river districts," with the object of reporting on. the suitability of the soil and conditions generally for extension of the industry which was proving so successful in the admirably adapted site selected by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bale.</inline> In the <inline font-style="italic">Agricultural Gazette</inline> for October, 1897, page 744, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Skelton</inline> published his opinions concerning the capabilities of the districts mentioned. As many present readers of the <inline font-style="italic">Agricultural Gazette</inline> have, perhaps, not seen the report, some extracts from it are now reproduced :  - " In all three districts - Clarence, Richmond, and Tweed - I saw large tracts of land, cleared and uncleared, well suited for coffee culture; soil and climate are all that could be wished for. I saw growing in the different districts, strong, healthy, well-grown trees, in many instances laden with fruit. With the wonderful fertility of the soil, and the general suitability of those parts of the Colony for the purpose, it is surprising that the industry has not progressed beyond the experimental stage." </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I need not discuss the matter at any further length. The industry has merely reached an experimental stage, and honorable members naturally desire to know why it has not progressed further. There are a number of reasons for that. One of them is that considerable difficulty is invariably experienced' in placing a new commodity upon the market. Initial obstacles in the shape of prejudice on the part of those engaged in the distributing trade, and of popular predilection for particular brands have to be surmounted. While these difficulties are being overcome the man who has embarked upon the industry has probably expended all his capital, and consequently has to close down. Unfortunately there is a prejudice against new goods, and a strong prejudice against colonial goods. We must recollect that almost every brand of coffee has a distinctive flavour. The same remark is applicable to tea, which I might well take to illustrate my contention. There was a time in New South Wales when its people used nothing but China teas. When an effort was made to place Indian and Ceylon teas upon the market it was unsuccessful for a considerable time. A good deal of money was expended before the attempt was successful, but to-day nearly all the tea used in Australia comes from Ceylon. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that in placing new products upon the market prejudices have to be overcome, and the popular taste has to be educated. That is one of the reasons why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bale</inline> has not been so successful with his coffee plantation upon the Clarence River as he would wish to be. As one who has been handling and selling coffee for the past thirty years, I claim to know as much about this article as a good many people. The sample of coffee which I had from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bale's</inline> plantation was as good as any I have ever used. Where an industry of this description can be started under favorable conditions, and by employing white labour, I say that it richly deserves a bounty. </para>

                        <para>- I have already endeavoured to show that unless a man is possessed of a very large capital it is impossible for him to successfully overcome the prejudices of the market, and to compete against vested interests. I think that we should come to the rescue of the coffee industry. It has been said that it would employ only women and children. I was reared in a farming district, and I have never met a woman who was any the worse for assisting her husband in the open field under proper conditions of Labour. When women did more of that class of work they were quite as good as they are to-day. </para>

During the course of the debate upon this Bill we have heard a good deal regarding the desirableness of establishing a Federal Agricultural Bureau for the dissemination of knowledge amongst our producers. I do not think that practical farmers are prepared to accept as gospel, information which is derived from books.

I repeat that farmers are not prepared to accept instruction at the hands of gentlemen who have merely the kudos belonging to an agricultural bureau. I admit that the Hawkesbury College has assisted the farmers of New South Wales very considerably. But such institutions can only inform the producers how a certain thing ought to be done. We now know how to cultivate the coffee-bush. But we want something more than that. Where is the justification for honorable members advising the Government to spend money in giving the farmers information upon subjects about which they know more than their would-be tutors? I hope that honorable members will not urge the establishment of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture, with the effect of duplicating the work which is already being done by the States. I ask them to favorably consider the proposal of the Government to grant a bounty upon the production of coffee, because I am satisfied that on the northern rivers of New South Wales there is a splendid opportunity for establishing the industry if it only receives the necessary stimulus. </para>

                    <para>. -  I intend to support the proposed bounty for the encouragement of the coffee industry in Queensland. At the same time I think that the representatives of that State and the supporters of the bounty have every reason to complain of the inadequate and imperfect information which has so far been placed before the Committee by the Government. Had they waited for the report of the Tariff Commission in reference to this and other matters I believe that a much stronger and more satisfactory case would have been made out. Certainly honorable members would not have been left in the dark to the extent that they have been, through the imperfect and incomplete manner in which the proposal has been presented. I 'wish to point out that the coffee requirements of the Commonwealth at the present time amount to about 1,000 tons per annum. Of that quantity, in 1903. about 50 tons were produced in Queensland - a very small contribution towards the vast possibilities of the industry. At the present time there are only 342 acres under coffee cultivation in that State. The information which influences me in coming to a conclusion upon this subject is fully set out in the evidence given before the Tariff Commission at Brisbane by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scriven,</inline></para>

                    <para>Cairns, Mackay, and Buderim Mountain are the three chief coffee centres in the State. All the coffee men at the Conference contended strongly that any lowering of the duty would be absolutely fatal to the industry, in view of the competition experienced with other countries, as instanced by the 6s. 8d. per day paid for labour in Queensland, against the 4d. per day paid in other coffee countries. After a full discussion upon the above three propositions, it was finally unanimously resolved that the Conference was of opinion that the coffee industry required a penny per pound further protection to cause its development. Although there was a falling off in the amount of coffee produced in 1903, as compared with 1902, this was caused by a frost at the end of the 1902 season, which played such havoc with the trees as to seriously reduce the 1903 returns. In spite of this decrease in yield, the area under coffee in 1903 shows an increase on the 1902 figures. Expert evidence quoted at the Conference showed that Queensland coffee is at present better in point of flavour, aroma, and liquoring quality than the average coffees of Central America, Brazil, &amp;c, which are the kinds mostly imported into Australia, and equal to the finest coffees of the East Indies, Ceylon, and Java in everything except liquoring quality. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the present high duty of 3d. per lb. upon coffee, I think that it is preferable to offer a bounty to encourage the production of that article, especially as tea, which is at present upon the free list, is a strong competitor with coffee, and has to a large extent assisted to diminish its consumption. Therefore, I regard the payment of the bounty as the most reasonable proposition, and I think that honorable members ought to give fair consideration to proposals of this kind, which have been placed before the Federal authorities in a business-like way, and which have been backed up by the Government and the Agricultural Department of Queensland, and by evidence which entitles them to favorable attention. </para>

The cultivation of coffee has been carried on in Australia for some years, and I fail to see what further claim for consideration the industry has upon us. A point worthy of special consideration is that coffee planters in Australia would have to compete with an enormous over-supply in the world's markets.

The reason is that the enormous production of coffee in Brazil has rendered its cultivation elsewhere almost unprofitable. </para>

                    <para>A few well managed estates in good soil in the coastal districts can still make coffee pay its way, but practically all the older and the native coffee plantations are now represented by lalang wastes, while the younger ones, and most of the European plantations, are planted up with Para rubber, or at times with cocoanuts. It seems a pity to see such magnificent coffee bushes as may be found on many estates in the Klang district choked out by rubber, but of course it is inevitable under the circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is wrong. There are honorable members of the Opposition who have had to light hostile constituencies on this very question of white labour. The position taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline> Smith is that the growth of these products in Australia would not be profitable, having regard to the rates of wages which the Federal Parliament, desire, and in some cases, require to be paid. Miners in Papua are indenting their black labour - I was going to say black slaves - and paying the magnificent sum of 10s. per month per man. From that amount fines are deducted from time  to time, and, in passing, I may say that I hope that during this session that question will be thoroughly inquired into. Evidence given before the Commission which recently inquired into the administration of Papua shows that one of the chief reasons why the cultivation of coffee there is advocated is that native labour is obtainable at£3 per annum per man. If the desire is merely to create an industry that will be able to supply local requirements, this item is unworthy of consideration. If, on the other hand, we are to build up a great national industry, we must be prepared to face competition in the markets of the world. Is it possible for us to employ men at 6s. or 7s. per day in an industry of this kind, when in the Malay Archipelago the rates of pay are only 6d. per day ? How can we. hope to compete in such circumstances in the open markets of the world? These are facts which honorable members should inquire into for themselves. I am satisfied that no honorable member would be prepared to put any of his own money into a business in connexion with which such a report as that of the experts how before us was issued as a prospectus. I have as much interest in the agricultural industry of Australia as has any honorable member, but I do not believe that we shall be able to establish industries of this kind. I do not consider that this system of spoon-feeding is calculated to create great national industries. </para>

                        <para>- That is a mere assertion. I am sure the honorable member would not be prepared to put a shilling of his own into the industry. Very few of those who support this item are prepared to back up their opinion with their own dollars. I quite agree with the honorable member who immediately preceded me that, generally speaking, the farmer can be allowed to proceed as he thinks best. He knows what pays him best. Coffee-raising has been tried for many years in Queensland, and I am sure we are all pleased to hear that the coffee produced there is excellent. Do honorable members believe that if there was a reasonable prospect of a profitable industry being established there, people would not be ready to embark upon it when we have a protective duty equal to 50 per cent. to encourage them ? I claim that the Federal Parliament has already given substantial assistance to the industry. In Brazil the price of raw coffee is not more than 6d. per lb. I think that the price of the ordinary coffee of commerce is about 4¾d. per lb. There is a duty of 3d. per lb. on raw coffee beans, and of5d. per lb. on roasted or ground coffee. The great argument in favour of duties such as these is not that they give revenue, but that they assist the producer, and give him an advantage as against the imported article, until the industry becomes established, and commands at least the local market. We are told that Australia is admirably suited for the cultivation of coffee, and I believe that the coffee produced here is exceedingly good. That being the case, surely duties ranging from 50 per cent. to 65 per cent. ought to be sufficient inducement to people to engage in the industry. But if we impose high protective duties on an article, which, if not a necessary of life, is, at least, an ordinary article of diet, we have a right to expect that the industry will be able to win its way without the assistance of a bounty. Are we to carry on a double-barrelled system of first levying what is considered to be a sufficient duty, and then adding a bounty? In a few weeks hence, when the Tariff is before us, we may be asked to increase the duty. If a majority of honorable members are in favour of protection, let them impose what they regard as a fair and reasonable duty, so that we may know exactly where we stand. </para>

                        <para>- The price of coffee in Brazil is certainly not more than5d. per lb., and, as the freight is not excessive, I think I am quite safe in calculating the duty as I have done. No doubt Arabian coffee is sold at a higher price, but the Brazilian coffee represents 75 per cent. of the world's production. Under all the circumstances, the industry ought to be able to exist without a bonus. Only some eight months ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline> Smith, then a member of the Senate, who had just re- turned from the Islands, stated in his place in Parliament that, from his own personal observation, he knew that thousands of acres of coffee plantations were going to decay, and that the cultivation of more profitable products was being undertaken, though the current rate of labour was 6d. per day. Under the circumstances, I see no hope of establishing a national industry able to compete in the markets of the world against the product of cheap labour. </para>

                    <para>.- I differ greatly from some honorable members who have spoken, in that I think we have a right to find employment for women exactly as we have for men. While I hold that the best place for women is the home, that is not the only place for them. A woman has as much right, if she chooses, to earn her living away from home, as a man has ; and I should not refuse to grant a bounty merely because it found employment for women. If it is possible to produce coffee in Australia, it would doubtless be a good thing for the country ; but I understand that, at the present time, there is a duty of 3d. per lb. I. do not know whether that duty was imposed for revenue or for protective purposes; but if merely for protective purposes, it would not appear to have done much good, 'because the overwhelming bulk of the coffee we use is still imported. That fact shows either that it is impossible to grow coffee in Australia, or that the duty is not sufficiently high. I am prepared to vote for a bounty of id. per lb. on coffee, or to go further, and give a bounty of 6d. per lb., if the Government, when it introduces the Tariff, will remove the duty of 3d. per lb. </para>

I am not in favour of any taxation which is merely revenue-producing through the Customs. If it is possible to produce coffee in Australia, it would be unfair to make the burden fall only on the people who drink coffee; all the people of Australia ought to pay equally towards the cost of establishing this industry. I take it that protectionists think that the duty will create a great national asset, find employment for the people by creating a great and mighty industry - and a lot of other things. _ If that be the end in view, then all Australia should contribute, and, with that view, I make the offer I have to the </para>

I think it is very hard, not only for the honorable and learned member, but for every other member of the Tariff Commission, to have to practically keep quiet whilst this Bounties Bill is being discussed, in case they may say anything which would' reveal the contents of their report. We may take it for granted that if the high-protectionist  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission takes that stand, the free-trade members will not be in favour of any increased duty. I do not say that that conclusion necessarily follows, but it is a fair and legitimate inference; and it seems tome that any one who deals in coffee ina wholesale way is in a position to conclude that the Tariff Commission will report against any increase in the duty. There is scarcely any one in the House better qualified to speak on Customs questions than the Chairman. of the Tariff Commission. </para>

                        <para>- Why, indeed? But the honorable and learned member's mouth must, in honour, be shut until the Tariff is submitted. That remark applies, not only to the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, but also to the honorable and' learned member for Illawarra, and' the honorable member for Perth, whom honorable members would be very glad' to hear, especially on questions which they considered as members of the Tariff Commission. The Committee is always glad to listen to men who have made certain subjects their special study, and the- members of the Tariff Commission devoted nearly three years of hard and laborious work to ascertaining the effect of the Tariff upon our industries. But now that the Bounties Bill is before us, they are practically forced to be silent for fear of making public information in regard to suggested Tariff changes. I think that the Bill should not be further proceeded with until the Tariff has been introduced; but the responsibility for what is being done lies with the- Government. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall vote for the proposed bounty on one condition, and that is that the Government will undertake to propose the removal of the duty of 3d. per lb. on imported coffee. Ministers have put the cart before the horse in bringing forward this Bill before they are ready to introduce their Tariff proposals. The coffee industry is certainly one which should receive attention. According to the report of the conference of agricultural experts, the cultivation of coffee gives a profit of <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> an acre, which, as those who know anything about agriculture are aware, is a good return. The man who grows vines does not make more than that. But the industry should be encouraged only on the terms referred to by the honorable member for Barrier, that is to say, in lieu of duty. The cultivation of coffee entails work similar to that entailed by the cultivation of tobacco. The tedious planting, transplanting, and weeding, which is necessary, is really Chinamen's work. Men cannot be paid to do' it. and therefore it will be necessary to employ women and children, such as in the cities are employed in factories, where their sweating conditions create sympathy in the hearts of honorable members. This is one of the few industries which might well be encouraged by means of a bounty ; but if a bounty is given there should not be a duty on imported coffee. </para>

                    (Illawarra.) [8.50J.- The honorable and learned member for Bendigo unintentionally misled the Committee by the quotations which he made from the evidence given by the, Queensland UnderSec.retary for Agriculture and Stock when examined by the Tariff Commission in Brisbane in June, 1905. I feel sure that his quotations created in the minds of honorable members the opinion that the Under-Secretary -favoured the giving of a bounty for the production of coffee. That he did- not do so is shown by his answer to question 29711. Ex-Senator Higgs asked him -

I shall not give away the position of the free-trade members of the Commission in regard to coffee. The honorable member for Cowper says that there are already so many State Departments of Agriculture that a Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau is not needed. I differ from him, because I firmly believe thai such an institution would greatly assist our primary producers. The Under-Secretary whose evidence I have quoted shows that the Queensland Government has already done a good deal for the coffee industry.

                <para>This is an answer to those who say that departmental experts merely sit in their offices, and are incapable of giving practical advice to the farmers. Good work has been done by the State Departments of Agriculture, and the Commonwealth would still further assist our primary producers if it gave them expert instruction and information. It would be better to do that than to grant bounties. A strong objection to the present proposal is that any coffee we might produce would have to compete with the product of cheap labour in other parts of the world. The experts who considered this proposal in conference have pointed out that in Brazil the coffee-plantations have been torn up. Similar evidence was tendered to the Tariff Commission by the agricultural expert of Queensland. When we consider that the industry is one which lends itself chiefly to the employment of women and children, surely it is evident that we ought not to go out of our way to establish it in our midst. It has been further pointed out by the State experts that the prospects of coffee cultivation in Queensland are not encouraging. It is perfectly true that some farmers who are engaged in the industry there have been fairly successful. A few are doing fairly well, more particularly those who are settled upon small holdings. But there is nothing in the report of the State experts to warrant me in supporting the Government proposal. In any circumstances, the amount which it is proposed to appropriate for the development of the industry is altogether inadequate, and a similar remark is applicable to most of the items contained in the schedule. I trust that the item will be eliminated. </para>

He has been consistent in his opposition, both to the imposition of protective duties, and to the payment of bounties for the encouragement of new industries. He certainly dwelt more fairly upon the conditions which obtain in regard to coffee culture than did any other honorable member who has debated the question from that stand-point. While the coffee industry has been described as one in which women and children will be chiefly employed, it must not be forgotten that their employment will be limited to the picking of the coffee when it has matured. </para>

                    <para>.- From the division which has just taken place it is evident that we cannot place too much reliance upon the declaration made by certain honorable members that when the schedule of the Bill was under consideration, they would assist in excising several of the items, and confining the schedule to two or three special lines of production likely to become permanent. Therefore, it seems that in endeavouring to save the taxpayers' money, we are simply beating the air. Nevertheless, it is the duty of honorable members on this side of the House to endeavour to safeguard the interests of the people, and to see that this money is not expended without justification or without an equivalent being obtained for it. None of the items already dealt with comply with either of these requirements. All involve an expenditure of public money amounting to an absolute gift, that will add only to the private gains of the individuals concerned in these various lines of production. Notwithstanding the discouraging results of the last division, I intend to persist in my efforts to secure the omission of some of these indefensible items, and perhaps one of the least justifiable in the schedule is that relating to tobacco. As honorable members are aware, we already have a heavy duty on imported tobacco leaf as well as on manufactured tobacco. We have an import duty of 3s. 3d. per lb. on the manufactured leaf entering Australia, with an Excise duty of1s. per lb., whilst on imported leaf entered to be locally manufactured into tobacco there is an import duty of1s. 6d. per lb. These should have had the effect - if any encouragement of the kind would be effective - of inducing the production of the highest grade tobacco leaf in Australia. But notwithstanding the inducements offered by these heavy duties, we find that the production of tobacco, instead of progressing, has receded. Whereas in 1888 there was a production of 7,868,112 lbs., in 1906 - after heavy protective duties had prevailed for eighteen years - the production had fallen to 1,387,500 lbs., a decrease of 6,480,612 lbs. I do not know the reason for this falling off, but we have the significant fact that, notwithstanding the existence of heavy duties, the industry, instead of being encouraged, has been unable to thrive. There were fluctuations during two or three intervening years, but generally the tendency since 1888 has been a declining one. In view of these figures, and the fact that these heavy duties should have given a great impetus to local production, I fail to see why we should be asked now to still further bolster up this industry by means of a bounty. It is well known that Australian tobacco is a low-grade production. Notwithstanding the heavy duties we are unable to grow a leaf anything like equal to the imported Cuban leaf. If the duties were double their present rate, I am perfectly satisfied that the Cuban leaf would still have to be imported. I was speaking the other day to a leading manufacturer of cigars, who told me that if he could secure an Australian-grown leaf of proper quality he would naturally prefer, as a protectionist, to use it. He explained that, as a matter of fact, we could not grow the best class of tobacco in Australia. </para>

He informed me that the Australian public demanded the imported leaf. It is evident that the Australian production must be inferior, since Cuban tobacco realizes1s. 9d. per lb. in the open markets of the world, whereas the Australian-grown article is worth only from 4d. to 6d. per lb. </para>

                <para class="block">In the absence of any explanation, honorable members will be puzzled to know why, if tobacco grown in the Northern Territory twenty years ago sold at 2s. nd. per lb. on the continental markets, no attempt has been made to persevere in the production. Surely it would pay' far better to cultivate a leaf that would realize 2's. nd. per lb. than to produce that for which only from 4d. to 6d. per lb. can be obtained. It seems, however, that for some unexplained reason the production of the higher grade tobacco was not proceeded with. This could not have been due to the need for a bounty, because the price obtained was much higher than that now ruling. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so, having regard to the fact that it realized 2s. 1 id. per lb. in the open market. Notwithstanding that there is a duty of 3s. 3d. per lb. on manufactured tobacco entering the Commonwealth, the imports of manufactured tobacco for 1905 were of the value of ^175,000, whilst the imports of unmanufactured tobacco during the same year were of the value of ^203,000. I am perfectly sure that prejudice against the local article is not the explanation for these large importations. They must be due to the fact that the imported tobacco is of better quality, and a far more 'marketable commodity with the Australian public than is the locally-grown tobacco.

                <para class="block">Why is this grade of tobacco not produced at the present time? If we have the soil and climate necessary for the production of a high-grade tobacco, it is strange that after many years of State coddling by means of heavy Customs imposts, we do not produce such an article at the present time. The answer apparently is that it cannot be produced, and I do not believe that it could be produced if the bounty were made ten times larger. From what I can gather from scientific experts, it is the absence of certain natural properties in the soil of Australia that is the cause of the trouble; but for this we should have had the highest grade tobacco produced here long before now.

                        <para>- I am adhering to the recommendations of the Conference of experts, who, I think, are right in desiring to encourage the cultivation of higher grade tobaccos. I do not know what other recommendations <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> made in regard to the higher grade tobaccos or cigar leaf, but I have the statement made by him that in Australia higher grade tobaccos can be produced. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> says - « </para>

                <para>Cigar Leaf. - There is now a demand for a limited amount of cigar tobacco at satisfactory prices, and farmers in the coastal districts are inclined to go in for growing this character of tobacco, and some thirty or forty acres will probably be planted the coming year, divided between the Coomera and the Cardwell districts, with a small lot at Bowen. For the small experimental lots grown this year very satisfactory prices were obtained. The samples have elicited most favorable comments from the purchaser, with the opinion that an' export demand can be created. Should this be so, the demand for these tobaccos will become a large one. I believe it is true that some of the samples show considerable merit, which will be greatly improved as the growers become more expert in the growing and handling. These tobaccos should prove very profitable, as in the country north of Bowen two crops per year can be grown, and should yield a ton to the acre - say, 12 cwt. for the first crop and S cwt. for the second one. At 7id. per lb. this would yield ^70 per acre. </para>
                <para class="block">This crop can thus be n.ade a very profitable one to small farmers with growing families, as children of either sex, from 12 to 16 years of age, can be employed to great advantage. I consider the outlook for the future of the tobacco industry in this State as most promising, and if farmers can be induced to take the necessary care both in cultivation and handling, we will gradually displace much of the imported article. Thorough cultivation is very necessary in this crop. </para>
                <para class="block">We have thus undoubted evidence that the higher grade tobaccos can be grown in Australia. And then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Howard</inline> Newport, Queensland Instructor in Tropical Agriculture, is thus reported in the Queensland official records - </para>

                    <para>Tobacco. - The culture of tobacco is beginning to receive some, though spasmodic, attention. The seasons in the north have been favorable, and it has been shown beyond doubt that a good and valuable quality of cigar leaf can be grown. The experiments at the Kamerunga State Nursery would indicate that with due care the trouble that decimated the crops when an effort was made to grow tobacco some fifteen years ago blue mould - may be avoided, and that there are certain varieties of cigar-leaf tobaccos that would seem especially suited to this district. </para>

                <para class="block">I think that the honorable member for Lang, after hearing these extracts, will admit that the very highest quality of cigar leaf can be produced in Queensland. I know that tobacco is grown in parts of Victoria and parts of New South Wales ; what is the extent of the cultivation of the higher grades, I am not prepared to state. </para>

It is with a view of encouraging the cultivation of cigar leaf that the bounty is offered; it is not for tobacco generally, which may or may not be sufficiently protected by the existing duty ; that is another question. </para>

                    <para>.- When the information before the Committee is analyzed, honorable members will not be so ready to take the step which the Attorney-General asks them to take. In the first place, this is a proposal to encourage the cultivation of tobacco " of a quality to be prescribed." I am ready to accept the Ministerial assurance that the prescription of the Customs Department will mean something like 10¼d. per lb. for a high-grade tobacco. </para>

                <para class="block">On  that particular point. Now in the evidence before us from the Conference of experts we find that the production of tobacco in Australia in 1904 was nearly 1,500,000 lbs. ; that in 1905 it was over 2,000,000 lbs., while in 1906 it was again nearly 1,500,000 lbs. The average production of the last three years has been  Something  over 1,500,000 lbs. per annum, though the slight falling  off  in the last year may be owing to the seasons or some other cause of the kind. Bearing in view the production, and the fact that the proposed bounty is 2d. per lb., we find that no less than £12,500 per annum would be absorbed, while we propose to grant only <inline font-style="italic">£4,000</inline> a year, or less than one-third required for the annual production, if all were of high grade. It is only for what the Attorney-General is pleased to call high-grade tobacco that we are asked to provide a bounty; but when I asked the Minister what was the proportion of the high-grade tobacco to the whole production of Australia, he could not tell me. The figures I have put before honorable members clearly show that if even only one-third of the tobacco annually grown in Australia at the present time were of high quality, every penny we are now providing as a bounty to encourage new industries, would be paid to people who are already established and conducting their business without any anticipation of Government assistance. That is a point the Minister must answer before he asks the Committee to pass the item. I take it that this is really a bounty to the Tobacco Trust - neither more nor less. There is a duty of is. 6d. per lb. on al! tobacco entered to be manufactured in the Commonwealth, and the imports for 1905 of unmanufactured tobacco were, according to the report, of the value of ,£203,000. Is it not to be supposed that the Tobacco Trust will encourage the local production of leaf of the quality it requires, in order to avoid the payment of duty on imported leaf? </para>

I am not here to defend the Trust, but I know that of late years it has imported two high-salaried experts from America to teach our farmers to grow high-grade tobacco. Hitherto they have grown a heavyweight tobacco instead of the stalkless kind that is in demand. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that the measure should be in charge of a Minister such as the Minister of Trade and Customs, who might be supposed to have the necessary technical knowledge and the close acquaintance with Customs rates which is required for the guidance of the Committee. The Bill, however, is in the hands of the Attorney-General, who seems to depend chiefly upon his ability as a special pleader to induce the Committee to accept the proposals of the Government. To my mind, he knows as little about tobacco-growing as I do, and, although a votary of " My Lady Nicotine," I am absolutely ignorant in regard to the cultivation of the plant. The honorable member for Wentworth has pointed out that an import duty of is. 6d. per lb. has not hitherto proved effective to encourage the local production of tobacco, and therefore it is not to be expected that a bounty of 2d. per lb. will do what is aimed at. During the elections the candidates belonging to a very important party announced themselves to be opposed to the establishment of monopolies, and prepared to nationalize those that already exist. But these bounties, if successful, will breed monopolies, which, according to the members of the Labour Party, must be put down by legislation. Thus they are assisting to create what they decry. But the Tobacco Trust is too powerful to need assistance from any Legislature. The growing of tobacco has been spoken of as a tropical industry ; but four of the proposals which were before the Committee this afternoon which were called tropical might now well be called "dropical," because the Attorney-General was soon forced to drop them. Then in a bland, quiet, and courteous manner he deplored the fact that the protectionists were not coming to his assistance, with the result that ever since he has had a 'most robust following, and has carried every item. It is useless to try to show the weakness of these proposals when the Government can whip up its supporters in this way. The Attorney-General is not armed with any technical information to support his special pleading on behalf of this proposal. Hitherto in Australia tobacco has been grown on soil which is too rich for the production of good leaf, and the saltpetre in the leaf has made it unmarketable. I deplore the fact that the Bill has been introduced before the bringing down of the Tariff proposals. This action on the part of the Government has had the effect of disfranchising the constituents of those members of the Committee who  aTe  members of the Tariff Commission, because they are unable to speak on the proposals now before us, lest they should make public the conclusions arrived at by the Commission. Under the circumstances it would be the right thing to move, as a protest against the action of the Government, that progress be reported ; but as&gt; Ministers have the numbers behind them, that course would be useless. The proposal before us, if agreed to, will result in the paying away, within a period of five years, of £20,000 of the taxpayers' money. I would like to see that amount added to the amount which has already been saved upon other items. We should then have  a  total sum of ,£137,000 which might profitably be expended in granting  a  bounty to the iron and ship-building industries. </para>

                    <para>. - I scarcely know whether or not I ought to vote for this item. I am anxious to encourage the tobacco industry, but I hardly think that that object will be achieved by the adoption of the Government proposal. If honorable members will look at the schedule they will see that the bounty is to be payable only upon leaf of high grade, and of a quality to be prescribed. According to the report of the experts, standard tobacco would be worth rod. per lb. I "do not wish to encourage persons to embark upon this enterprise, to incur a huge expenditure, and to produce a leaf which may be worth only 9d. per lb. I have seen splendid tobacco grown in South Australia and at Tumut. The very finest article has been produced in both places, but because the growers are not acquainted with the proper method of curing the leaf, possibly it might not come up to the prescribed standard. As a result, they would have wasted both their time and their capital. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Upon the other hand, if we fix too low a standard we shall simply be making a present of the bounty to the Tobacco Combine. If honorable members will turn to the report they will see - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Some of the best qualities of leaf have a value as high as 5s. per lb., while over twenty years ago some Northern Territory tobacco sold by auction at Hamburg at the rate of 2s.11d. per lb. Against this we have the fact that the tobacco at present being produced in the Commonwealth has a merchantable value of only about 4d. to 6d. per lb. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Surely some of the tobacco produced in the Commonwealth must have been worth more than from 4d. to 6d. per lb., but if we fix the standard at 9d. or10d. per lb., there is no hope of our growers reaping any benefit whatever from the proposed bounty. I understand that the idea underlying the proposal to restrict the payment of the bounty to high-grade tobacco, is the encouragement of the cigar trade in Australia, and I do recognise that outside the Combine there are many cigarmakers. At the same time, I want to be sure that we are going to afford the growers an opportunity to earn this bounty. Unless the Attorney-General can show that they will have that opportunity, if tobacco be grown in suitable localities, I shall vote against the Government proposal, and shall favour the imposition of a higher duty upon that commodity. </para>

                        <para>- No. As the schedule is. drawn, the bounty will not benefit the tobacco-grower. The Government proposal, if adopted, may result in the production of about 1 cwt. of picked leaf of the quality necessary to earn the bounty, but that is all. In exactly the same way we frequently read in the news- papers that a particular individual has obtained from  2s.  to 3s. per lb. for lamb's wool. But when we look at the list of sales we find that only one or two specially selected bales have realized those high prices. What we want to insure is the production of a tobacco leaf of good quality, which will command a ready sale. If the present duty of1s. 6d. per lb. upon that article is not high enough, let us increase it, but do not let us offer a bounty for its production. One honorable member has said that our soil is unsuitable for tobacco culture because of the saltpetre which it contains. I would point out that in Manilla it is impossible to grow tobacco upon land which does not contain saltpetre. That is the difference between Manilla and Havanna tobaccos. There is no saltpetre in Havanna soils and consequently a purer leaf can be obtained there for cigar-making. But cigars can be produced in Manilla which are equal in quality to 75 per cent. of those imported from Havanna. I visited Manilla some two and a half years ago when the present Secretary for War in the United States was the Governor there. He assured me that the cigars produced in Manilla were better than 75 per cent. of those obtainable in America. The mere presence of saltpetre in the soil does not prevent tobacco of a good marketable value being produced. But if the bounty is to be of any use to growers, we shall require to fix the standard price at 8d. per lb. Some honorable members have said that if we fix the standard too low we shall be making a present of the bounty to the combine. I need scarcely point out that, hitherto the combine has chiefly devoted its attention to imported tobaccos. I claim that we can grow tobacco in Australia equal to any that is imported. It is fit for smoking purposes, although I do not think it is suitable for cigar making. </para>

                    <para>. - The Attorney-General has stated that there is an Agricultural Bureau in Queensland which imparts special information to the producers in regard to the planting of tobacco. May I remind him that in several of the States similar bureaux are in existence. Years ago it was the custom in </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">New South Wales to distribute tobacco seed for experimental planting, to all those who chose to apply for it. No difficulty whatever is experienced in producing this commodity in several States. One honorable member has stated that the presence of saltpetre in our soil is not the cause of the failure of the industry. Whilst I entertain the greatest respect for his opinion, I may mention that that was the reason assigned for the great check which the industry sustained in New South Wales. The saltpetre affects the curing process, and causes the leaf to become damp, with the result that it commences to sweat. Consequently its market value is reduced. Some years ago in Tarcutta and Tumut, immense quantities of tobacco were produced, but the industry experienced a severe check, because of the difficulty encountered in curing the leaf. Under the Government proposal the bounty will be payable only upon leaf which will command 10d. per lb. No grower can depend upon realizing that price for his product, even though he may grow the very best leaf. Up till the very last day of baling the tobacco, he cannot be sure that the leaf will not be sweated, and consequently depreciate in value. Under such circumstances, no bounty would reach him as the result of his enterprise. If we are to grant a bounty, let us take care that it shall be given for the growth of the leaf itself. If a crop does not realize more than 6d. per lb., it is the misfortune of the grower, who has to contend with many difficulties. I am not prepared to say that the tobacco plant is a purely tropical one. As a matter of fact, it is grown all over Australia, and I have seen experimental plots of it in some of the cities of the Commonwealth. The industry is a very profitable one, provided that the growers are able to cure the leaf successfully. Reference has been made to a proposal to bring to Australia experts in the curing of tobacco, who would be able to impart technical instruction to the growers, and if we could grant some encouragement in that direction, much good would be done. The difficulty that the saltpetre in the leaf may cause the tobacco to sweat, and so depreciate its value, is a very serious one, and I think that we should not make any stipulation as to the quality of leaf in respect of which the bounty shall be paid. If a man takes all the steps essential to the successful production of a high-grade leaf, he should not be denied the bounty merely be cause he has the misfortune, owing to circumstances over which he has no control, to produce an inferior article. Let us give the grower every encouragement, so that if at the finish he is unable, owing to no fault of his own, to produce an article of first-class quality, he may be induced to make still greater efforts to achieve success. At the present time, the Combine determines what shall be the price paid for the local leaf, and it is said that in the past the members of this Combine have been largely responsible for the non-success of the industry. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to support the proposal. The discussion which has taken place upon it must have shown the Minister that the question is a complicated one. and that in dealing with it, we are entitled to have the assistance of those who, as members of the Tariff Commission, have given much time and attention to it. Those who desire to have the fullest information before them feel that it is unfair that we should be called upon to deal with this item at a. time when the mouths of the honorable and learned member for Illawarra, the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, and the honorable member for Perth, are closed. </para>

It stands entirely upon its own merits, and is designed to encourage the production of a high-grade tobacco leaf of a quality to be prescribed. I propose to deal with one or two points that have been raised by the honorable and learned member for Balaclava, and the honorable member for Hindmarsh, as to the quality of the tobacco in respect of which the bounty is to be paid. Although the Conference of experts recommended that the bounty should be paid only on tobacco leaf realizing not less than a certain price, named in the report, the Government recognised that prices frequently fluctuate ; that they depend largely upon varying conditions, and may be affected by manipulations of the market. In these circumstances, we considered it advisable to simply provide that the bounty "should be paid on high-grade tobacco leaf of a quality to be prescribed. This will insure the production of a better class of tobacco leaf than is now being grown. The class of leaf that we wish to encourage is that which is at present bringing about 9d. or 10d per lb. It would be impossible, however, to provide- in the Bill that the bounty shall be paid only in respect of such tobacco as is now bringing 9d. or rod. per lb. As was pointed out bv the honorable and' learned member for Balaclava, as the result of operations on the market, tobacco leaf now bringing 10d per lb. might later on realize only 8d. </para>

It is a highly desirable form in which to give a bounty ; that is to say, to give it for the production of high-grade tobacco. The difficulties connected with the production of a fine quality of leaf ave infinitely greater than those which apply to the growing of the common or garden varieties, of which we have plenty in Australia. The production of high-class tobacco is largely a matter of experiment  and suitability of soil. . Such experiments are exceedingly costly. I have in my possession certain figures, which are not at the moment available, but which I should like to bring before the Committee. I do not know whether the Minister will consent to an adjournment. If not, I will simply state that I trust the item will be passed in its present form, as being likely to encourage the production of a desirable quality of leaf. </para>

                        <para>- If the question of paying the bounty is to be determined while the plant is standing, it will simply be a matter of ascertaining the quality of the leaf. But the commercial value referred to in the report before us is determined after curing. I should like the Minister to make it clear what practice is to be pursued. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that it is fair for Ministers to refuse an adjournment. The Committee has done good work to-day, and honorable members are entitled to consideration. I should have liked to speak at some length with regard to tobacco cultivation, but, unfortunately, I have nearly always spoken late in the evening since I have been a member of this Parliament, and my electorate is so closely concerned with tobacco cultivation that I should like to have a better opportunity of expressing my views. There is not a man sitting in the Ministerial corner who does not advocate an eight-hours' day. We have been sitting for eight hours, and have done a fair day's work. The Acting Prime Minister will not, in view of my thirty years' acquaintance with him, suspect that I am not prepared to act in accordance with his wishes. </para>

                    <para>.- I am quite prepared to assist the Government by remaining here as long as they deem it necessary ; but I am not prepared to vote for this item until I am shown that the proposed bounty will not get into the hands of the Combine. It has been stated on both sides of the House that under the terms of the bounty it will necessarily prove a present to the Combine, who are the only purchasers of tobacco, and can, therefore, fix the price as they choose in the absence of any competition. I will not vote public money to one of the wealthiest trusts in Australia, when the intention is that the assistance shall be given to the growers. It is due to the Committee that we should be told how the Government propose to prevent the bounty taking the form of a present to the Combine. </para>

                        <para>- There is no standard rate of pay in regard to the cultivation of tobacco in the Commonwealth. I do not desire to encourage people to grow tobacco unless I am sure they will get the bounty, because it is an industry which requires a good deal of capital. I find that it is now determined not to fix a price, but the quality as the standard; and I desire to know what that quality is to be. Is the bounty to be paid only on leaf which is used for cigars of the better class, or is it to be on leaf such as is used by the Combine? If the latter be the case, the bounty will be a present to the Combine. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. If the "better classes" of leaf spoken of by the Minister are to include the leaf used by the Combine, then the latter will get the bounty - a result of which no one can approve. When I look at the difficulty which workers in the tobacco trade have at the present time to obtain anything like a decent wage and steady employment, I object te; the Combine receiving .£20,000 for nothing in return. The growers will be entirely in the hands of the Combine, and that is what I wish to avoid. If the Minister can show me that he can fix the grade so that the leaf grown up to the standard required will be used principally by the manufacturers of cigars, many of whom are outside the Combine, I shall be willing to vote for the item. But if the bounty is to be given to the growers of leaf for the Combine, I shall vote against it. </para>

                    <para>.- It is amusing to hear some honorable members on the other side cheer when it is stated by any one in this corner that the proposed bounty will go to the Combine. I have not the slightest doubt that they know more about the Combine than does any one on this side. Hitherto they have always been ready to denounce any honorable member for stating that there was a combine. </para>

But in their anxiety to-night to omit an item, they are willing to cheer any honorable member who states that the bounty will go to the Combine. I am as much against this Combine as I am against any other trust or monopoly. I am not anxious to put £20,000, or any -less sum, into the pockets of the Tobacco Combine; but if the Ministry can give me an assurance that they will so frame the regulations that the tobacco leaf will be graded, and that the bounty will be paid to the growers, and not to the Combine, I shall be prepared to vote for the item. </para>

In reply to the honorable member for Yarra, I may say that the Bill provides that the bounty shall be paid to the growers, and the regulation will be so framed that it will be paid to them, just as the -sugar bounty is paid to the grower. </para>

                    <para>.- I certainly am not satisfied with the proposal as it stands. A few years ago, I moved a motion in favour of the nationalization of the tobacco industry ; and, on looking over the data which I then gave to the House, I find that there is no reason to believe other than that in Australia there is almost a complete monopoly in regard to tobacco. I do not think that my honorable friends opposite will deny that statement. We have to face this position, that, no matter what bounty we may pay on the production of leaf here, it is very likely that the effort of Parliament to encourage the bringing of a substantial acreage under tobacco crop will be frustrated for the simple reason that there is only one buyer in the Commonwealth, and that that buyer is part of a combine which is world wide. There have been times when the production of tobacco was a very considerable industry in the Commonwealth, particularly in Victoria. In 1880, 1,941,296 lbs. of leaf were grown in Australia, but about sixteen years later, the production had fallen to 802,000 lbs. The reduction resulted from the. concentrated energies of those who were buying tobacco from Australian producers and the consequent reduction of the price which was ' offered for Australian leaf. The reason for that state of things was very exhaustively explained by me when I submitted my motion. The combination which is interested in the Combine in Australia has its' interest in plantations in other parts of  the world, chiefly in America, where they can produce tobacco leaf at a very much less cost than can be done in Australia, pay the border duties, and still place the article on our market at a lower cost than. that at which it could be produced here. If I thought that the granting of a bounty would encourage to any extent the production of tobacco leaf in Australia, I should be prepared to give this item very serious consideration. But because I believe that if we placed a percentage per lb. on the tobacco it would lead to the Combine offering a lower price, and leave the grower in the same position as he now occupies, I think - especially in view of the very limited data which the Minister has submitted - that it is advisable to give the item more serious consideration before we come to a decision. The Ministry have been very successful with- the items in the schedule. They have. not been met with any factious opposition. In fact, no very serious opposition has been offered to any proposal when it has been shown that there was a reasonable prospect that the bounty would lead to the establishment of an industry which would be for the good of the Commonwealth. When, however, there is a consensus of opinion from all quarters of the Chamber that the proposed bounty will be a gift to a powerful financial institution in Australia, and that it will not be of any use to those for whom it is primarily designed, I think that the Attorney-General should not take too serious a view of the' suggestion to delete the item at the present time. On the information which has been presented, I am prepared to vote in favour of its omission. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister, because while he has led us to understand that the high-grade leaf will be used in the manufacture of cigars, he has merely said that the cigar-leaf will be included, and consequently it will still be used in the manufacture of tobacco, and the bounty will go to the Combine. I believe that honorable members generally are of opinion that we should encourage the growing of high-class tobacco for cigar-making ; but we* should certainly state our object plainly, and so frame the provision that there will be no fear of the bounty going into the hands of the Combine. I am not ready to leave this to the Minister, and consequently I wish to move an amendment, striking out the words "of a quality to be prescribed" in order to substitute the words " for use in the manufacture of cigars." </para>

                        <para>- That is a danger which. I, as well as the honorable member, wish to avert. I should regard this proposal much more favorably if I were  s,ire  that the bounty would be paid to the growers themselves. The honorable  member  has, apparently, made a close study of the trust, and if, as he states, the tobacco trade is wholly in the hands of this organization, it will be able to take the whole benefit of the bounty.' The Committee naturally asks that the class of tobacco for which the bounty is to be given shall be defined in the schedule. It is spoken  of  vaguely as "high-grade." The Minister has told us that a regulation will prescribe what is meant by those words. But, notwithstanding his repeated assurances in regard to this and many other matters which have been before us during the debate, the impression on my mind is that he knows' as little about this subject as I do, which is practically nothing at all. I' ask honorable members whether they are prepared to hand over their legislative powers to the Minister, instead of insisting upon having a definition embodied in the schedule. Some intelligent amendment such as the honorable member for Hindmarsh wishes to move is required. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to ask the honorable member for Hindmarsh whether it is not a fact that certain cigarette tobaccos are also of a high grade, and that enormous quantities of these tobaccos are annually imported by the Trust. I have seen some of these tobaccos, and it has been pointed out to me why they excel the local product. I think that the amendment scarcely meets the situation, inasmuch as it deals with only half the product. </para>

                        <para>.- It is singular that the responsibility for the advertisements appearing in newspapers published in most of the coal-mining centres of England cannot be fixed. If my memory serves me rightly, some of these advertisements state that intending immigrants must be approved by the Agent-General of New South Wales, and that  £6  will be given towards the passage money of each man selected. . We have an Immigration League seeking, by its own methods, to encourage immigration, yet no one appears to accept the responsibility for these advertisements. I trust that the vote passed for advertising Australia will be used in a legitimate way, and will not he handed over to any irresponsible body for distribution. </para>

                        <para>.- Complaints have been made on several occasions as to misleading advertisements appearing in the English newspapers, and a number of attempts have been made to ascertain their' origin. We ought to have some means of learning who is responsible for these misrepresentations. The Ministry might well take the matter in hand and invite the Agents-General to endeavour to discover who is inserting these advertisements. We shall then be able to properly apportion the blame, and know what steps to take to prevent the Commonwealth being misrepresented by advertisements published without the sanction of responsible bodies in Australia. The Acting Prime Minister might very well, in the interests of all parties, prosecute this inquiry, in order that we may ascertain who is responsible for advertisements ' not only misrepresenting Australia, but inviting coal miners and other labourers to come here to compete in an already overcrowded labour market. It would be most unsatisfactory to leave the matter at its present stage, and I hope that the Government will take steps to have the question definitely settled. </para>

                    <para>SirWILLIAM . LYNE (Hume - Treasurer) [11.29]. - Like the honorable member for Cook, I feel that we ought to know who is responsible for these advertisements. I have seen one or two which, to my mind, are highly improper; but I do not know yet whether I can take any further step in the matter. </para>

                            <para>- All I can say is that I have seen in English newspapers one or two advertisements that ought never to have been published. I arn anxious to find out who is responsible for them, but I' cannot make any definite promise to the honorable member for Cook as to what action will be taken. I shall, however, cause further inquiries to be made. </para>
