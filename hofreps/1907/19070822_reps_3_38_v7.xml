                        <para>. - I think that the Acting Prime Minister should ascertain from the Minister of Home Affairs if it is not possible to have the statistics which are issued to members from time to time printed in the smaller size in which they will appear in the annual volumes instead of in the size of our business papers. It seems to me a waste of energy and of money to print these statistics on paper of a large size, and then to re-set them to print them on paper of an octavo size. Why is not the same course followed in regard to the Commonwealth statistics that is adopted by the Victorian Government Statistician&#39;s Department, which prints the information which is circulated from time to time on paper of the same size as is used for the annual volumes? Then, the copies of Bills which are put before us are printed on sheets much larger than the pages of the sessional volumes of Statutes, and probably considerable expense could be saved by printing them on paper of the same size. No doubt if more thought were given to the printing of documents much expense could be avoided. </para>

                        <para>- The chief papers with which the House deals are Bills and notices of amendments, and although they are printed on a large-sized sheet, the printed matter itself occupies only the same amount of space on the sheet as it sub se- sequently occupies on the pages of the bound volumes of Statutes, so that no reprinting is necessary when the bound volumes come to be prepared. The difference between the size of the sheets used in this Chamber, and the pages of the bound volumes, is accounted for by the wideness of the margins which are allowed in the first instance, but these margins are found by honorable members to be convenient for the making of notes and memoranda. An attempt is made to follow one pattern in all our printing, so that there may be no re-setting of matter. The statement of the  honorable  member for Robertson, that the size of the paper used in some cases is that of the pages of the Blue Books issued at the end of our sessions is correct. A return relating to Customs has been circulated amongst honorable members which will have to be overrun to reduce its size, but the fact that it does not conform to the ordinary rule is, I imagine, due to the haste with which it was prepared. A constant endeavour is made to save expense by printing documents in such a way as will suit all kinds of publication. </para>

                        <para>.- There are many directions in which savings could be effected, so far as the printing office is concerned, and among these might be mentioned the saving which could be made in connexion with the publication of Commonwealth statistics. At the present time monthly bulletins are issued which are got up in a very expensive manner, and are printed on the best paper. The information contained in them is, I think, of no practical utility to honorable members,  the  press, or the public generally, and if they were issued quarterly instead of monthly the convenience of Parliament would be amply met. To issue these bulletins monthly is a pure waste of time and of money. I had intended to call the attention of the Minister to the matter previously. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no hesitation in saying that to print statistics and other information in forms of different  sizes  is exceedingly  costly.  It should be a standing rule that only one size shall be used  for  all printing. This would prevent over-running,  and  would allow matter which  had  to be kept standing to be stereotyped. The reprinting of tabulated matter is especially costly if  it  has to be reset. The subject is  one  to which  the  Printing Committee might  well  give attention. There should be a standard size, especially for tabulated matter, and it should be strictly adhered to. </para>

If it is possible to reduce expense by requiring that all printing shall be done in the same form as regards size, I shall not hesitate to bring about that reform where possible. With regard to the question asked by the leader of the Opposition, I know that there is a sum on the Estimates, but I am not sure what it is for.

                            <para>- There is no further difficulty, so far as I am aware. I have not been advised to-day that any fresh action has been taken by the Premier of New South Wales, but, so far as this Government is concerned, a demand has been made upon the State for the return of the goods, and instructions have been sent to Sydney for the immediate issue to-day of a writ for the recovery of the property wrongfully taken from the control of the Customs authorities, and for an injunction to restrain the State authorities from disposing of the property.; Instructions are also being issued with reference to the recovery of penalties in connexion with the removal of the goods. I expected that I should have been able to inform the House when it met, that the writs had been issued and legal proceedings commenced. </para>

                                <para>- It was a lawyer who commenced the trouble, and I venture to say commenced it in a way that will not be supported by the people of Australia. I desire to take this opportunity - because the matter relates to the question which has been asked - to make a statement regarding the history of this case from the beginning. I have a long statement here in reference to it, some portions of which, perhaps, it would not be judicious to publish, in view of the fact that legal proceedings have already been instituted. But I should like to read to the House &#39;a summary of that history. </para>

                                <para>- The whole history of the negotiations between the Commonwealth and the Government of New South Wales is in type. The understanding arrived at was that the Government of New South Wales and not the Commonwealth authority, should bring the matter before a higher Court. I have just read a summary of the history of the case which has been prepared by the Crown Law officers, and it shows that the facts are as I have stated. The reason why trouble has been experienced in this connexion is that, at the time the case was tried <inline font-style="italic">bv</inline> the Supreme Court of New South Wales&#39;, the High Court was not in existence. The history of the case shows that the New South Wales Government have been endeavouring to get the matter before the Privy Council, instead of before the High Court. The Commonwealth Government have declined to accede to that proposal, and have urged that the matter should be brought before the High Court. </para>

                            <para>- In regard to the seizure of wire netting, I should like to know from the Acting Prime Minister whether any legal difficulty has arisen in applying the provisions of section  35  of the Judiciary Act, which was specially passed to meet this and other cases? The section, which is a very long one, provides that the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court is to apply to, amongst other judgments, the judgments of the Supreme Court of a State, including &#34;every and amy such judgment given or made before the commencement of the Act.&#34; That section was inserted in order to cover this amongst other cases held over. </para>

If further proceedings are taken it may be necessary to apply for- an injunction to restrain the State Premier from disposing of the goods, and to prevent him from touching any further goods io charge of the Customs. </para>

                            <para>- It appears that dutv is charged on cases at the same rate as that imposed on the contents of- cases. A specific instance was mentioned to me in which  a  case, which had cost <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2,</inline> arrived containing goods which were subject to duty at 30 per cent, and on that case the Customs charged 12s., although its actual value was only about 2s. in Australia. I ask the Acting . Prime Minister whether it is possible for him to direct that only the actual value of cases shall be considered in charging the duty. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the honorable member to give notice of that long question. I should like to say that the sale of opium by chemists has been brought under my notice. Chemists sell opium by virtue of the licence they hold ; and when I find that, in sparsely populated places, they sell as much as 2 lb. weight in one month, it is time we inquired more closely as to the purpose for which they sell it. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to ask the Postmaster-General whether it is within his personal knowledge that, in view of the intention to establish a new exchange in Melbourne, firms, which for the last thirty years, in some cases, have had certain numbers attached to their telephones, have been dispossessed of those numbers in order that they may be given to new subscribers? One firm, with which I am acquainted, has for the past twenty-four years had the city number of 378; but during the. last few days that number has been transferred to the Electoral Office in the Department of Home Affairs. . These changes cause a great deal of inconvenience to firms; and I ask whether something cannot be done in the matter? </para>

                        <para>- No; the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> never needs a reply. I propose briefly to put before the House what, in my opinion, are the real facts in regard to the question of defence, and. what action I think should be taken. Honorable members recognise that this motion has been submitted by a private member, and is neither a party nor a Government question. I trust that it will&#39; never become a party matter, but that in the near future it will be made a Government question. I make this statement in order that it may be perfectly clear that although my colleagues are anxious - and I am sure  every honorable member of the House is - with regard to the future of Australia, and feel that the future depends upon the measures taken for the defence of the Commonwealth, they will not be compromised in any way by the views I shall express to-day. They fully appreciate the vast importance of the issue, but it is their due that I should first submit to them in detail an expression of my views before they are asked to commit themselves in any way. </para>

                    <para>- So many conversations are taking place in the Chamber that it is almost impossible for the Minister to make his speech. I wish to ask, in the first place, that the conversations taking place be carried on in much lower tones, and, in the second, that the honorable member may be allowed to make his speech in his own way. He has doubtless mapped out what he proposes to say, and should be allowed to adhere to his ownplan. </para>

The question of defence is of vast importance, and I am sure that every honorable member recognises the difficulties which must necessarily confront the Minister for the time being, whoever he may be, in endeavouring to grapple with it. My statement today must be regarded as  an  individual expression of opinion, dependent to some extent upon the experience I have gained during the last few months. Whether or not the Government will eventually accept my views on this question is a matter yet to be determined. </para>

                        <para>- I am not here to compromise my colleagues; that is no part of my responsibility. I do not desire to labour the consideration of this question from the view point of its importance to Australia, for every one fully recognises its significance in that regard, but I will endeavour to deal with the principles which the motion involves. The history of Australia is so well known that it is sufficient to state that a hundred years ago it possessed no wealth, whilst to-day its wealth amounts to 000,000,000. Australia to-day is one of the richest plums that, metaphorically speaking, could fall into the mouth of a nation&#39; capable of taking it, and, unless we were part of the Empire, there are many nations which could to-day become possessed of that plum. If a public man in Australia today has occasion, when addressing a public meeting, to refer to the wealth of Australia, he is greeted with rounds of applause, and when he speaks of the defence of Australia, his remarks are likewise greeted by the plaudits of his audience. This indicates that the public is apprehensive of our position, and desires that 0 change for the better should be made. That being so, it is not necessary for me to do more to-day than to state what the Government has done, and the end T have in &#39;view. I again desire to remind honorable members that I am not speaking in my Ministerial capacity. Honorable members ask what the Government have done. We have done a great deal towards improving the defences of Australia, and every step we have taken will be regarded by the House generally as being in the right direction. </para>

                        <para>- When I refer to what we have already accomplished, I am speaking Ministerially. We have increased the strength of our Cadet Corps from 18,000 to nearly 40,000 members. I have seen in the press the statement that we are not going to defend Australia by means of our Cadet Forces. That is perfectly true, but every one recognises that the minds of our boys are receptive, and that they are capable of obtaining a better idea of their national responsibilities and more readily assimilate ideas and training in their youth than they are likely to do if their training be left until later in life. If Australians knew the game of war as well as they understand the games of football and cricket, we should not be troubled very much about our de-  fences. I should like to make cadet work and rifle shooting the great national pastimes of Australia. That is one object we have in view, and every one will agree that it is a step in the right direction. A further forward movement &#39;is the formation! of new rifle clubs. The strength of our rifle clubs has increased to between 40,000 and 50,000 men. No doubt the members of our rifle clubs are excellent marksmen - as good probably as any in the world ; but they are undisciplined, and need to be taught the kind of work which they should be required to perform as part of a defence force. A scheme has, therefore, been perfected for the drilling of the rifle clubs, and probably of the 40,000 to 50,000 men who belong to these clubs not less than 25,000 will prove themselves able to render good service in time of need in the defence of the country. We have not yet made any changes in regard to the militia, and a little later reference will be made to the difficulties which have to be met in considering such changes. But provision has been made on-the Estimates for the filling up of a few units, and the manning of batteries which, hitherto, have been undermanned, and arrangements have been made for some increase in the light horse. The inquiries which it was necessary to undertake before these changes could be made showed me the seriousness of our present position. The Government has submitted to Parliament a proposal for the local manufacture of small arms, such as bayonets and rifles, thus anticipating a motion  of which the honorable member for Maranoa has given notice. It must appear very strange to the ordinary man that Australia commenced her preparations for defence . without making a serious attempt to become self-supporting in the matter of the munitions of warfare. It is incomprehensible that decade after decade nothing has been done towards the local manufacture of small arms  and ammunition. </para>

                <para class="block">However, a sum has now been placed on the Estimates to initiate this work. To show how necessary it is that we should be in a position to make our own small arms, I would point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Borden said at the Imperial Conference that, when, in 1900, Canada needed 1,500 rifles, she could not buy one. If Australia really needed rifles, she would probably not be able to obtain one. Every one knows, too, of the difficulties experienced in obtaining cordite during the South African war. Without factories for the manufacture of small arms and ammunition, our scheme of defence may, in time of trouble, dissolve into thin air. We must be able to manufacture the munitions of warfare, because we shall not be able to procure them in our time of need. Those are two of the definite steps which the Government have taken in the direetion&#39; of improving Australia&#39;s defence. A sum of &#163;50,000 has also been placed on the Estimates for the improvement of forts and lights, as well as &#163;250,000 for coastal defence. Most Governments would have been satisfied with the advance made, which has been considerable. Had it been determined that the defence of the Commonwealth was to be permitted to remain as it was, I could not have retained my present position. My colleagues have the fullest sympathy with the defence movement, and I have endeavoured to place before them none but sensible and moderate proposals. We are all antagonistic&#39; to war, because we know what a horrible and dreadful thing it is ; but the misery and despair of defeat and national destruction are worse. Ministers, therefore; feel that we must prepare for war in order <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> avoid national extinction, and the only time in which to make these preparations is in time of peace. If I were able to inaugurate a system of defence which would be accepted by, and sufficient for Australia, T should be glad to leave the Defence Department to-morrow. It is no pleasure for a layman to be Minister of Defence, because, in addition to the serious responsibility, much of the work of the Department concerns matters of which he has no knowledge, and he is beset with difficulties and perplexities, and continual apprehensions. I do not, however, think it is necessary to publicly complain of work which was freely undertaken. Every sane man in Australia knows that, if this country is to remain the home of the white man, it must be held, not by the power of Australians alone, but by the might of the white man in all parts of the world. In years to come, it will take the white man all he knows to hold New Zealand and Australia. Therefore, we must not break the link which binds us to our fellow countrymen in other parts of the world. By consideration, generosity, and a broad appreciation of our responsibilities and dangers, we must seek to knit together the white men of this and other lands in preparation for that last deadly conflict which will assuredly come upon Australia. The fact that Australia desires to accept her responsibilities, that she feels that she is no longer in swaddling clothes, but has grown up, and ought to stand up in her mother&#39;s house, does not brand her with disloyalty. In the discharge of our responsibilities, we must work with the Empire. In proportion to our population and our wealth, we should do as much as the Britisher is doing. At the present time, Great Britain spends nearly &#163;63,000,000 a year on her war machine. France spends &#163;42,000,000, Germany &#163;46,000,600, Russia &#163;50,000,000, and the United States &#163;44,000,000, whilst Australia spends only &#163;800,000 a year. What sort of a war machine can we hope to get for so small an expenditure? Per head of population the countries which I have mentioned spend from 12s. to 30s., and Australia only 4s. The attitude of Parliament has always been that it does not mind spending money legitimately, but objects to wasteful expenditure. If it be made plain (hat money is propose&#39;d to be spent wisely and intelligently on defence, Parliament will be ready to vote it. </para>

I have had a large number of requests for extensions along the existing lines, but have endeavoured not to accede to more than were rendered imperative by the exigencies of the situation. I have taken this stand because of the great cost of the present system. The individual members of the permanent staff cost, taking the average cost of the different branches, from &#163;169 to &#163;408 a year. Australia will not find money for an extension of the present system on those lines. </para>

                        <para>- It is all available to honorable members-. I wish to show the House that if we extend our forces under the present system, we shall speedily be submerged financially. The maintenance of 100,000 men at &#163;19 per head would involve an expenditure of approximately &#163;2,000,000. A force of 100,000 men in training is not too many for the protection of this continent, but when honorable members realize that the cost of their maintenance would represent about &#163;2,000,000, I know that there will be doubt as to obtaining parliamentary sanction. Then it may be asked, &#34; Why not proceed along the lines suggested by the volunteer movement?&#34; The infantry portion of our volunteers costs &#163;6 8s. 6d. per man, the rifle clubs cost &#163;1 10s. 3d., the cadets (senior), &#163;1 16s. 6d., and the cadets&#39; (junior), &#163;1 3s. I will eliminate the last three branches of it, and confine my remarks to infantry volunteers, whose maintenance costs &#163;6 8s. 6d. per annum. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am merely making a general statement - it is not possible to go into details. Honorable members understand that when the militia man enters camp he is paid for undergoing his course of training, whereas the volunteer is not. Under these circumstances, neither in Australia nor in any other country, can the volunteer movement succeed. </para>

                        <para>- In the first place, it is not succeeding. The reports received from the Commandants in the States all point to a great &#34; slackness &#34; in connexion with our volunteer forces. There are demands from Tasmania, and from other States, to convert volunteer forces into militia. The reason is not far to seek.&#39; Let us suppose that two men are working together in a foundry, and that one is a militia man, and the other a volunteer. The former will receive 8s. per day for attending camp, while the latter will receive nothing. Consequently the volunteer does not go into camp unless it suits him to do so. </para>

                        <para>- In dealing with the question of volunteer <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> militia, one is forced to this conclusion - that if members of the latter body receive 8s. per day for undergoing a course of training, whilst members of the former forces get nothing, every man will naturally endeavour to join the militia. Obviously unless a man is fired with enthusiasm, he will not undergo - without reward - a period of service for which his co-worker is paid. In this connexion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane,</inline> the British War Minister, has elaborated a scheme which is a reasonable one, provided that men will volunteer. But many able critics maintain that the scheme is hopeless, because men will not volunteer. If war broke out tomorrow Australians would rise as one man. No trouble would be experienced in obtaining volunteers at such a time. There has never been any doubt as to the valour and. patriotism of Australians, and there never will be. But it is not only valour and patriotism in time of war that is required. We want those qualities to be asserted in time of peace, and in the absence of those special conditions which seem for the time being to elevate a man beyond his manhood. </para>

                        <para>- No. Patriotic spasms simply mean a rabble in time of war. If men are to fight, they must be drilled and disciplined, just as men have to be trained to play football. What I am concerned with is not the honour and patriotism of Australians, but the fact that in times of peace. they are playing football and amusing themselves, and that consequently when the dark day arrives they may not be prepared for war. Therefore we must make it obligatory on the manhood of Australia to accept this portion of their national responsibility.. Of the school boys as cadets we have 15 per cent, under training, of the senior cadets, only 2 per cent. With regard to our troops, militia and volunteer, if we set down the number at 20,000, that represents - in proportion to the number of men between r8 years and 60 years of age in Australia, namely, 1,135,662 - only 1.9 per cent. The total number of males in the Commonwealth between 12 years and 60 years of age is 1,410,000, so that at the present time undergoing some form of military training, there is one schoolboy in every seven, one youth (under 19) in every fifty, and one man in every fifty-two. -In other words, there is one Australian being trained for defence in every 112 of our male population, or less than 1 per cent. That is the position. Less than 1 per cent, of our population are being trained for defence. If any honorable member is satisfied with that state of things the &#39; Government are not. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot make a definite statement, but obviously not all that 1 per cent, is efficient. Some of our officers can boast less than two years of service. The length of service performed in the volunteer and militia forces averages but two or three years. Officers and men enter those forces, and leave them just as they see fit. The acceptance of the motion of the honorable member for West Sydney in its entirety would involve expenditure in the training of 500,000 men per annum. Of course, it is beyond our power to shoulder such a burden. I am quite content that the House should pass the motion even in its present form, recognising that it embodies merely the contemplation of an ideal. It must be years before we shall be able to work up to that ideal. Upon that understanding, I would be prepared to see the motion accepted by the House. But to imagine that we can incur the expenditure to train 500,000 men annually at the present time is absurd. What then can we do? In the first place, we can deal with boys and young men till they reach 21 years of age. If we do that, we shall have! a great body of men who have been properly drilled and trained- </para>

They become smart and possessed of a knowledge of drill. But under the present system, we lose them at fourteen or sixteen years of age. My idea is that we should control them till they have attained twenty-one years of age. If we did that, the lads would never forget what they had learned. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. If we contemplate the training annually of 100,000 men, armed with 100,000 rifles, together with the necessary instructors, the problem becomes an important financial one. If we retain our control over youths till they reach 21 years of age, we shall have made a progressive step. But even when we have caught our men, we shall not have solved the whole problem. We have the men, but there is a doubt as to the military training of our officers. An officer requires to be a man of ability, of resource, and stamina. But when we want to choose an officer, under the existing system, instead of selecting him on type we examine him in algebra. The whole proceeding is farcical. </para>

                        <para>- They do not rule. Good progress is being made. If a man requires a mate to go With him to the Gulf of Carpentaria, or anywhere else, what does he do? He does not select an individual who has a receding chin, and who may, however, not be afflicted with tuberculosis or some other disease. He chooses one who is physically fit to accompany him. But we make applicants for commissions in our military service, if their health be not impaired, submit to a test in hydrostatics or trigonometry. The honorable member for. Wide Bay has asked who is to choose our officers. It is suggested that if one authority selects them, unless a candidate has the odour of Toorak upon him,, he will not be accepted. But, again, another man may come from Footscray, and other authorities will not have him. We must have some selecting authority and if any honorable member will show me. how to get that authority, he will solve one of my most serious problems.  </para>

                        <para>- I am but new to the business, and I am informing the House frankly how the question appeals to me. I am sure that honorable members will tell me, when I submit a proposal, that caution is required, and caution is also required on the part of honorable members. We must not&#34; dragoon the people; we must have consideration for the circumstances in which they are placed, and for the vocations which they are following. There is just one point more. It would be an easy matter to pass a law saying that the people must be trained; but we must have some school of instruction for the officers who are to train the men. I have done what .is possible in this connexion with the Sydney University, and trust that similar steps will be taken by those in authority at the Melbourne University. I have done as much as is feasible with the system and methods at hand. But if we are to have men to train our citizen soldiers, those men must be educated professionally, and there must be an educational establishment of some description. </para>

                    <para>.- The House owes a debt of gratitude to the honorable member for West Sydney for submitting this motion. I am quite sure that the honorable member, when in England, not only did good from an Australian point of view, but showed the people there that, although we are so far away, we still desire to remain part and parcel of the Empire in ill-fortune and trouble as well as in peace and prosperity. I am accused, in Queensland particularly, of being Imperialistic. If to be loyal to my country, to the land that gave me birth, is to be Imperialistic, I plead guilty to the soft impeachment. It is the primary duty of every citizen to defend his country ; and all, of whatever station or position in life, must acknowledge the truth of that declaration. Only a few years ago, in the Transvaal, people, practically untrained and fresh from their work on their farms, on the roads, or in the mines, ably defended their country against overwhelming odds as represented by men and money. If such a creditable defence could be made so inexpensively, I cannot see why some similar system- to that of the Burgher Forces should not be introduced here. The nearest approach to a suggestion to that end is contained in the motion of the honorable member for West Sydney.&#39; The desire is not to make every man a soldier, or to fill us all with military ardour and spirit. Ali the motion affirms is that every citizen, of the full age of twenty-one years, and entitled to the franchise, should be prepared to defend his country. There is nothing wrong that I can see in such a proposal. As to compulsion, if we are to enjoy the benefits of citizenship, we ought to take part in the defence of our country in time of danger. That is a personal duty Which cannot be delegated - to delegate the duty is to neglect it. This question was referred 10 by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in an able speech which he delivered in London, when there were some notable gentlemen on the platform from which he spoke. I am pleased to say that, although the honorable member was in the society of Dukes, Duchesses, Lords, and Ladies when in England, he has returned to us the same &#34; Billy &#34; Hughes. That, however, is by the way. The Labour Party, and, I believe, the whole of the people of </para>

                <para class="block">Australia, believe in a citizen soldiery. I am satisfied, as the result of my travels throughout the Commonwealth, that there is no prevalent military spirit. I am further satisfied, however, that should the hour of danger arise, the whole of the men of the country would rise as one in its defence. But we do not wish the men of Australia, in the hour of danger, to rise as assembled mobs; we wish them to be scientifically-trained, armed, and drilled, and subject to discipline. </para>

                        <para>- That goes without saying. What is the good of putting a rifle into the hands of1 a man unless he is able to use it ? We might as well arm cattle and horses as arm untrained men. I have known them accused of not being able to hit a bell tent with the door shut, when it might be thought that a miss was impossible ; but, unfortunately, it often happened that the shot hit the ground. There is no doubt that ability to shoot is indispensable. There is only one way of obtaining a citizen soldiery. The&#39; Minister has told us of the enormous cost of the present system of defence; and I say, with all the fervour of an Australian, that we are living in a fool&#39;s paradise. . The man in the street thinks that because we have muddled along for so many years, we, a peaceable people, who do not desire war, will continue to go on swimmingly in the future. But when the time comes, who are the people who are the most prepared ? Those who have been trained, drilled, and taught to shoot. In order to see the value of citizen soldiery we have only to read the life .of &#34; Stonewall&#34; Jackson. The book was lent to me by the Minister of Defence,- and I can assure honorable members that it was a revelation to me. I had always believed until then, that a man could be made into a soldier in a few weeks. I find, however, that it took years of the Civil War to render the &#34; Stonewall &#34; Brigade as efficient as it proved itself. It required drill and discipline, marching and counter-marching in the presence of &#34; Stonewall &#34; Jackson himself, for long enough ; and, but for this close training, the Southerners would have gone down badly many a time. Those men in the &#34;.Stonewall &#34; Brigade saved the position times out of number, simply owing to their steadiness and ability to shoot straight, consequent upon long drill, discipline, and training. After reading the book to which I have referred, </para>

                <para class="block">I could see that I had been on the wrong track. There is no desire to have a standing army, but merely to bring our citizens into a state of efficiency for defence ; and the system proposed is the best and the cheapest. I think that the honorable member for West Sydney, when he submitted this motion, must have had in his mind Rudyard Kipling&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Army of a Dream,</inline> but, at the same time, I am satisfied that it would be a good thing for Australia if the dream could be turned into a reality. The system suggested is so simple, compact, and efficient, that it could easily be got into working order. I well remember, as a lad, seeing the annual recruiting for the militia in the East End of London. I never saw such a rabble as used to be taken away to Hounslow Heath, there to be trained and drilled. No one would have supposed that by any system of training they could be turned into soldiers ; but when they came back after their thirteen weeks&#39; continuous military discipline, their wives, mothers, and sisters did not know them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that these militia men had been turned into perfect soldiers, but a wonderful difference had certainly been made in them. Why, we have only to see the people who attend gymnasiums, to realize the. beneficial effects of physical training. As a matter of fact,, many of those militia men got so imbued with the military spirit, that usually 50 per cent, or 60 per cent, of them enlisted in the regular forces for three years. Life in the regular forces cannot be so&#39; bacl as some people would have us believe, otherwise so many men would not hanker after it. When I was at Woolwich, . a number of militiamen from Lincolnshire joined the battery of horse artillery <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> which I was attached, and, within six months, one could not distinguish these recruits from those who had seen long service. This shows the value of the training which the militia receive. </para>

                        <para>- My experience satisfies me of the value of the training which the militia receive. When I was at Woolwich, a number of men from&#39; the East End of London joined our battery. They were a very rough lot, but, in order to qualify for service in the artillery and the engineers, they had to put in six months as recruits, and they were very soon knocked into shape. It is only in connexion with the&#39; infantry forces that three months&#39; service as recruits is required. In many cases, militiamen from London and its suburbs, who joined the artillery at Woolwich and the engineers at Chatham remained in the service for years, and proved themselves very good soldiers. In times of war the regular soldier is the national hero, but he is not so regarded by many people in times of peace. Shortly before I left the old country, two Lifeguardsmen and a man in the. Coldstream, Guards were refused admission to the Criterion Theatre. The War Office authorities could not compel the manager of the theatre to admit privates in uniform, and the authorities then said, in effect, to him, &#34; If you will not admit a private into your theatre, you shall not* admit an officer.&#34; They overcame the; difficulty by declaring various theatres in the West End of London &#34; out of bounds,&#34; in the same way as houses of assignation or streets which it is thought the troops should not frequent are treated. This action on the part of the authorities soon relieved the tension, and privates in uniform were soon admitted to the theatres. Prior to this action, managers of theatres in the West End of London did not wish to admit common private soldiers; but such a state of affairs could not possibly arise under a scheme such as that now before us. If it be adopted, every adult male - rich or poor, old or young - will have to submit to compulsory service. As the Minister has said, every man, whether he comes from Toorak or Footscray, will have an equal opportunity to serve his country. The honorable, gentleman; was right when he said that the success of our defence system does not hinge on the shooting capacity of our riflemen &#39; and militia. My experience leads me to indorse that view. At the battle of Ingogo, in Natal, in  1881,  the marksmen of the different regiments were ordered to the front, to act practically as sharp-shooters. Other men, who were merely ordinarily efficient marksmen, how ever, did more execution- than did the picked marksmen. The reason for this was that the sharp-shooters had to go nearer the enemy than the rest of the forces were called upon to do, and naturally they were in a little bit of a funk. They recognised that they were not shooting at mere inanimate targets - they were shooting at men with rifles who returned their fire. The consequence of this was that their firing was not so steady as it would have been had they been practising on a rifle range. We found during the campaign that pot-hunters were no good in active service. It is right that our riflemen should acquire proficiency with the rifle, but it is still more important that they should become amenable to discipline. A body of riflemen who are not amenable to discipline in active service would become a mere rabble. The &#34; machine V in their case would not act. The high esteem in which Tommy Atkins is held by military authorities is due to the fact that in action he is a mere machine. At the battle of Ingogo, with the exception of myself, every one of the gunners attached to my gun were shot down. As soon as members of the Rifle Brigade saw that I stood alone they came out to assist me. Fortunately for me I had not been hit, but had it not been for the disciplinary training I had received I should doubtless have bolted. long before I did get a chance to leave. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that I should have done. At all events I had no thought of deserting the gun as long as mv officer directed me to stand by it. Unfortunately he was wounded, and I was left alone, but I am glad to say that I brought the gun out of action. In connexion with that fight we had an irregular force known as Beddington&#39;s Horse acting &#39;as a cavalry escort for our battery. The King&#39;s Dragoon Guards were doing the vedetting and scouting, and the irregular force to which I have referred  was left to protect us. As soon as the rifle fire began to get hot Beddington&#39;s Horse became somewhat scarce. The Rifle Brigade, however, stuck to us until it was able to take us out of action. There again we experienced the difference between a disciplined and an undisciplined force. I would commend to honorable members the August number of the <inline font-style="italic">Call,</inline> which is replete with interesting information relating to military matters affecting the Empire. I propose to read a few paragraphs from an article on The Battle Value of Marksmanship, by Colonel H. J. Foster, R.E., Director of Military Science at the Sydney &#34;University. The article is a very able one, and I am sure it will be read with interest by honorable members.

                    <para>It would be easy to show that a great accuracy of individual fire has no practical value on the battle-field, for one simply seeks to cover with bullets the zone of ground on which the enemy moves. . . The fire of bad shots may be more efficacious than that of good marksmen. Besides, in order that the latter, who form a small minority, may continue to fire well, it is necessary that they should have the same presence of mind and calmness as they have on the practice range, which is impossible. </para>

The  Boers  themselves are the best proof of my contention, for, though the best shooting race in the world  as  individuals,  as a body their practice, judged by previous experience, has been worse than second rate.

                    <para>- The Government is on the right track in its endeavour to assist the cadet movement. I give the Minister credit for doing the right thing in providing that the young idea shall be taught to shoot and to drill. When in Brisbane last Saturday, my heart swelled with pride to see the zest with which the youngsters entered upon military manoeuvring. Each corps tried to excel the others, and they put many of the militia and volunteer corps to shame. The Minister has increased the -expenditure on cadets from ?18,000 to ?40,000, and I, and the members of the party to which I belong, will assist him in every way to increase their efficiency. But we should be careful not to lose our grip of these youngsters when they leave school. They should become part and parcel of our Defence Force under some such system as &#39;that proposed by the honorable member for West Sydney. Parliament will have to adopt some such scheme as he proposes ; we cannot go on as we are going. The Minister pointed out this afternoon that, under our present system, very little result would be obtained from an extra expenditure of ?200,000, and that, under that system, ?2, 000,000 would be heeded to provide efficiently &#34;for our defence. Every sane man knows that Australia could not afford to expend so much on defence. But if some such system as that which the honorable member for West Sydney has introduced is adopted, and the people are made to see that conscription is not &#34;what is intended, they will rally round and support it. I represent an electorate which is as large as New South Wales, but in that immense territory there is only one battalion of mounted infantry and one company of cadets, although there are many men who desire to obtain military training. In Western Queensland we have the finest material for mounted infantry that it is possible to get, and the cost of training the men there who are desirous of becoming part and parcel of our Defence Force would be practically nothing. Most of them are skilled marksmen, and nearly everyone of them possesses a rifle and a horse. </para>

                        <para>- The cost would be very little under the scheme of the honorable member for West Sydney. As he told us; three weeks ago, those who in Switzerland are rejected, return downcast, and even burst into tears, because they have not been allowed to enroll for the defence of their country. As members of the British race, we have an equally strong desire to be ready to serve in the defence of our country. I am surprised to hear from the Minister that at the present time men are being taken into the ranks without medical examination. I am surprised that he allows that. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied that the honorable gentleman will remedy it at the earliest opportunity. I again impress upon him the need of keeping a grip upon the members of our cadet forces after they leave school. That can be done by providing places where they can meet together, drill, and play at soldiers, as many of them 3o now in the parks. Let them train themselves for defence, as the members of football clubs train themselves for their games. In this connexion, I should like to read an interesting paragraph in the <inline font-style="italic">Call,</inline> which is headed, &#34; The Army of a Dream &#34; - </para>

                    <para>Lt.-Colonel Underwood (late 4th Hussars) :  There is a school of about 300 boys there- (Vevey), and I went one Saturday afternoon to see them at their games. I did not know what they were going to do. Their game, instead of being &#34; rugger &#34; or &#34; soccer,&#34; was a game of a regular field day. There was a shed from which they pulled miniature field guns, which they had made specially for themselves. They had shelter trench, drill for one company, and other companies attacking, and a march past afterwards before the head-master, who was a major in one of the militia regiments. I do not know whether it is done in other schools, but at this school at Vevey there were 300 boys whose games were sometimes of an entirely military nature, and they struck me as being rather more important and useful for their country than the games we have. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the spirit I should like to see engendered here. Instead of being mad over football, let our boys show their skill in attacking and defending trenches. The knowledge which is instilled into them while they are young will increase as they grow. Their brains are more active than those of older men, and they enter into things with more zest. Military training is something out of the ordinary to them, and they enjoy it. Of course, we do not wish to create the military spirit, but we wish to imbue them&#34; with the desire to be ready to defend their native land. When I was in Brisbane on one occasion, a little boy of my acquaintance told  me that he was a lance-corporal. I said, &#34; When you are a sergeant, I shall give you a sovereign.&#34; About a couple of months afterwards, he wrote asking me to send the money. I saw him on the school -ground in South Brisbane drilling a squad. Although he is only twelve and a-half years of age, he put his fellows through a series of marches and counter-marches in a way which would have put many an older man to shame. I am .very pleased that the Government has stolen my thunder and propose to start an ammunition factory. </para>

                        <para>- I believe in the establishment of a military college in which every student will be treated alike, no matter what his parentage. I agree with the Minister that military promotion should not depend on social influence and position, but upon military fitness. Of course, we cannot, do everything at once, but I feel sure that if the honorable member for Richmond remains in office for any length of time he will bring about great reforms in the Defence Department. The <inline font-style="italic">Call</inline> contains a frontispiece, copied from the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> to which I think attention should be drawn. It is a picture showing a struggle in the football field, between the blacks and blues, with over 50,000 persons looking on with the most intense interest, while beyond, at the rifle butts, are half-a-dozen men shooting, with a deadbeat lying up against a post in the vicinity. The half-dozen men who are trying to fit themselves for the defence of their hearths and homes are not watched or cheered by anybody, but at the football match 50,000 persons are shouting themselves hoarse in encouragement of men who are merely booting a ball. Those pictures vividly illustrate the blindness of the Australian  public in regard to the defence of the Commonwealth, and show that something is amiss. In like manner, the Romans engaged in their games when the Goths were at the gates. Honorable members, instead of committing the <inline font-style="italic">Call</inline> to the waste-paper basket, as some of them do, should study it, because it is ably edited and well written, and contains the best statement of our defence needs that I have seen. </para>

The honorable member, with his military knowledge, must realize that at present we are living in a fool&#39;s paradise. The question of defence is a most serious one, and it should be treated seriously. I am just as fond of a jest as is the honorable member, but in my remarks upon defence matters I am very much in earnest. &#34; Speaking upon this question during his recent visit to London, the honorable member for West Sydney said - </para>

                    <para>It is perfectly true that in conscription, as we know it on the Continent, every man is liable to be called for service and has to present himself ; and it is quite true, too, that under universal training every able-bodied man of suitable age would be called upon, but there the similarity in the two systems ends. Conscription produces militarism ; universal training destroys it. Conscription produces a caste ; universal training deals with the nation and places all men on one level. Conscription keeps a man long enough in the colours to make him primarily a soldier; it takes him from his civil employment for three, four, or five years at a critical period of his life ,- it withdraws him <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> production ; it often ruins him for any civil calling. </para>
                    <para>To pay taxes is not pleasant, yet it has to be done, and no man would dare get on a platform and say that any State could be governed without taxation. </para>

                    <para>Universal training should have regard only to the defence of one&#39;s own country, and not to foreign service. No doubt the Volunteer system is the best for that. A man should not be asked to leave his country if he does not wish it. But as to the duty of defending one&#39;s country, no one who enjoys citizenship can have, or ought to have, any doubt about that. </para>

                <para class="block">I desire to enlarge upon that aspect of the question. I am of opinion that every man who claims a vote is in duty bound to fit himself for the defence of his country. I say that in the Commonwealth we should adopt the plan which is followed in Cape Colony. There, as soon as a man claims the franchise, he is handed a rifle and a bandolier of cartridges, and told that his name has. been placed on the field cornet&#39;s register, and that the field cornet requires his attendance so many days a month until he has been passed by the Commandant of the corps to which he belongs. Every male at the age of twenty-one years should be prepared to defend his country, otherwise he should be denied the franchise. I would male every Government servant shoulder a rifle.&#39; I would not exempt even members of Parliament. So long as Australia needs my services in her defence, I shall be prepared to go to the front. </para>

Unless a man is prepared to perform not only that duty, but every duty that belongs to a citizen, he has no right to vote at all. There is the incentive. Every man wants a vote in the country, and no man ought to have it until he has fitted himself to perform the duties of citizenship. Let us see that he deserves these things. </para>

                    <para>Lord Roberts, in thanking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> for his address, said his only regret was lhat <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;s</inline> words of wisdom and warning had not been listened to by thousands of their fellow countrymen. Especially did he regret that they had not been heard by all the leading members of the Labour party. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> spoke with the authority and knowledge of a man who had held office under a Labour Administration in one of the freest and most democratic communities in the world. He would like to think that his clear and unhesitating declaration on the duty of every man to undergo a certain amount of  military training would have some effect on the Labour party in this country. It was to the Labour party chiefly that the members of the National Service League looked for assistance in carrying out the great reform for which they were working, and he confessed it surprised him how intelligent and sensible men could be misled by catch phrases and bogeys about militarism and conscription, and could view with disfavour a scheme based on the principle that it was the duty of every able-bodied man, whatever his birth, position or wealth, to be prepared to take his place in the defence of his country. ( Cheers.) The object of the National Service League was essentially a national one, and had nothing whatever to do with politics. He looked forward to the time when the question of personal training for national defence would be accepted by all parties in the kingdom as the most fundamental duty of citizenship. This was the end for which the National Service League was working, and he regarded that meeting as a great step forward in the achievement of their aims. (Cheers.) </para>

                <para class="block">Those are noble sentiments from a noble son of Britain - from a man whose very name we all revere. Lord Roberts is seventy-five years of age, and in the winter of life is sacrificing his personal comfort in an attempt to bring the nation to its senses. Every one of us must applaud him for his action. As an old soldier, I think that he is the finest man in the world. It would be easy enough for him to sit down and say: &#34; My days are few in the land. Why should I not seek peace and comfort?&#34; But no. He realizes that the nation is drifting in the wrong direction, and seeks to stem the tide. He is looking to Australia to take her place in the van of this reform movement. If the Government are not prepared to go all the way that the honorable member for West Sydney proposes, I am satisfied that they will go a portion of the way.

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Maranoa always speaks upon military questions with extreme fervour, and his utterances are usually of such an ultra-British character that I like in some measure to echo them. The motion under consideration is a specific one, and in replying to the speech of the honorable member for West Sydney, the Minister was practically content to expose many of the weak spots in the defence of Australia today. It was only towards the fag end of his address that he answered the contention of the honorable member for West Sydney that all able-bodied men should be thoroughly drilled in the use of arms. He also declared that his utterance was not a Ministerial deliverance, but a private one. Certainly it was a mysterious one, and for some time I was unable to understand which side of the question he intended to take. While the honorable member for Maranoa was making his fervent appeal, I nut a very simple question to him. I asked him who. was to pay the additional cost which the adoption of the system which be advocates would involve. I am one of those who believe that a very large sum will have to be provided in the near future for the military and naval defence of Australia. When the scheme forecasted by the Prime Minister is dealt with, means will have to be devised to obtain the necessary revenue to carry it out. Of course I am aware that there is an inherent dislike amongst Britishers and their descendants for the principle of conscription. In continental countries the practice is to remove men from their industrial pursuits for three or four years for the purpose of making them undergo a course of military training. The motion which is now under consideration does not contemplate that, but it does contemplate that our able-bodied males shall devote a certain portion of each year to military drill, and to training in naval warfare. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied that Australia will never be&#39; content to adopt the continental system of conscription. For naval purposes, a man is trained for four years; but it is well known that, having regard to the scientific apparatus on board a modern warship, it is impossible to impart a complete training within that time. This has been proved in Great Britain, where there is the greatest reluctance to allow a trained man to escape from long service. When a man has been in training; in Great Britain for three or four  years, he is not allowed, unless under exceptional circumstances, to buy his release ; and the result is that the men in the British Navy are the most highly-skilled of gunners. In Germany, the men have a choice between the land forces and the naval forces, but, owing to the shorter period of training, their  man-o-warsmen  are not nearly so efficient as those of Great Britain. The honorable member for Maranoa several times spoke of Kipling&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Army of a Dream;</inline> and I should like to point to  the  great change that has come over the spirit of the dream of this Parliament in reference to defence. Five or six years ago the Labour Party, to which the honorable member for Maranoa and the honorable member for West Sydney belonged, were so anxious to destroy the military vote, that on &#39;one occasion they reduced it bv &#163;120,000. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly, because it was directed against the viciousness of the system which was then in vogue. In our schools there is what is called the Junior Cadet Force, and my own opinion is that the boys should go straight from the Junior Cadets into the Senior Cadets when they leave school. I am no believer in a complete knowledge of barrack-square drill and manoeuvring. There are many men who are capital drill masters, but who would be of no use in the field ; and I do not think that the young people of Australia should have their time wasted by such training. Here I should like to suggest that the annual encampments might be made movable. It is very easy to find a volunteer or militiaman quite conversant with company drill, but it is very difficult to find one with a working knowledge of the topography of Australia, although such knowledge would be invaluable in time of invasion. To-day we have a volunteer and a partially-paid system of service. My opinion is that the Government must either abolish the partially-paid system and have all volunteers, or abolish the volunteer system, and have all pax-,  tially-paid  men. We cannot have men in the same walk of life working in camp under diverse conditions; nor can we expect the partially-paid man and the volunteer to have the same enthusiasm under such circumstances. Our volunteer system is successful only in time of danger. Let there be a rumour to-morrow of trouble between the Empire and some other&#34; power, and within a month the volunteer ranks would be greatly swollen. After the danger is over, however, the Volunteer Forces dwindle, and nearly all the regiments are incomplete. The volunteer is useful only while his enthusiasm lasts, and he is enthusiastic only in time of trouble and danger. At the time of the Boer war, the difficulty was to prevent our young men from going to South Africa; and they did not care whether they went as &#39;volunteers or as partially-paid men. The volunteer regiments of Australia were never stronger than at that time ; but we cannot expect success in that  direc-&#39;  tion in times of peace. The Minister of Defence, in his remarks to-day, expressed more advanced views and even radical ideas than any of his predecessors have done. In my opinion, the school is where the defence movement ought to start. It is not only for the sake of inculcating feelings of patriotism, and a desire to defend the country, but also for the sake of the health of our young boys that the cadet system ought to be encouraged. In my opinion, the age of twenty-one is too high for compulsory drill. My own idea is that the training ought to be compulsory up to eighteen years of age, and then allowed to be voluntary. If a boy at the age of eighteen is not imbued with patriotism, he never will be. At that age, however, character is fairly well formed ; and I believe that practically 90 per cent, of those who had been compulsorily drilled, would continue under the volunteer system. The senior cadet system is admirable, not only as providing discipline for active service, but also as providing discipline for the purposes of everyday life. I do not desire to  enter  upon an ethical discussion, but I know from my own experience, that young Australians of seventeen or eighteen are mostly of an energetic disposition, and have a great desire to be &#34; on the move.&#34; It is  my belief that,  if  we had a good system of senior cadets, much of&#34; what is known as larrikinism - which, after all, is often only energy in the wrong place - would be prevented. The force of the example of steady comrades would be sufficient for the youth who was too restless. I make no apology for larrikinism, but I do say that my countrymen, who readily adapt themselves to circumstances, would greatly benefit by the training and discipline&#39; afforded by service  in  the senior cadets. The youths would be inspired by a desire to attain a higher standard of conduct, and the discipline would have great effect  in  -fitting them for the duties of citizenship  in  times of peace, while tending to remove what must be admitted to be -a present weakness, namely, the want of love of home life. This characteristic may arise from our salubrious climate, inviting, as  it  does, to outdoor exercise as a pastime. Many a young fellow, with the makings of  an  excellent  man  in him, has gone astray for want of good comrades, such as he would meet under a proper system of senior cadets. My idea is that the junior cadet, under a compulsory system, would be moulded physically, and that, as a senior cadet, he would receive what would be more  in  the nature of a moral training. It is undoubtedly true that, except in times of danger and excitement, the average private in a volunteer regiment has to bear the derision of his fellows as he walks abroad  in  his uniform. Any one who has had to do with the volunteer movement must acknowledge the truth of what I say. These men who are nobly performing the duties of citizenship receive, instead of respect, the ridicule of those who ought to be following their example. I do not say that every young man does so, but certainly a large percentage of our young men &#34;look down&#34; on a volunteer, and  it  is about time that this feeling was removed. The honorable member for West Sydney has done good work in submitting this motion ; but I can inform him that there is still  an  idea current that what he means is conscription. The system,  if  my suggestion were acted upon, would mean compulsory training until the age of eighteen years, but, after that, the system would be absolutely voluntary. Australia is sadly  in  need of  an  increased number of naval brigades. Land forces are more readily equipped and recruited than are naval forces. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I believe that Port Jackson, Port Phillip, Newcastle, Fremantle, and various other Australian ports, afford a fine recruiting ground for the naval brigades. The young men in our various ports would take more readily to naval than to military drill. In this regard, the Commonwealth has a splendid opportunity to do good work for the Empire. We could not do a greater service to the Empire than we should by drilling for naval service the thousands of men available in our ports. Great Britain can find the ships and we should be able to provide thousands of properly drilled naval brigade men. So far, the attention of honorable members has been devoted chiefly to a consideration of the necessity for raising more land forces, but I think that we might well consider the propriety of strengthening our naval forces. I am pleased to learn that the Minister is not satisfied with the system under which our officers are trained to-day. If we are to have compulsory training for adult males, we should also provide a system by which the humblest man in the ranks may fit himself for the highest office in the service. At the present time, officers in our volunteer or partially-paid forces have to incur considerable expense in respect of uniforms and mess-room charges, and the result is that they constitute, a distinct caste. We cannot afford to allow the training of our officers to proceed upon such lines. We need to obtain the best available material, regardless of where it may come from, and we should give every man an incentive to work his way up from the ranks to the highest post in the service. I heartily approve of the Minister&#39;s suggestion that we should establish a College of Military Instruction. We know what has been accomplished by the Military College at Washington, and we might well found an Australian college upon similar lines. At the same time, it would be well to provide for exchange of officers with Great Britain from time to time, in order that the military accomplishments of our staffs might be extended. The honorable member for Maranoa is able to speak with great force on this question, since he has seen, active service. I have followed the military and naval movements of other nations, and when I consider that the Boers, without any special training, were able for three years to resist 250,000 trained soldiers from Great Britain- </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister has hinted at a military and naval establishment involving a very large expenditure. I hold that if we are going to subject all classes to a system of conscription, such as that proposed by the honorable member for West Sydney, we should call upon the wealthy sections of the community to contribute something to the cost. It is well that Australia has awakened from her lethargy in this respect. There is no doubt that the successes scored by Japan against Russia during the recent war awakened Australia to a knowledge of her true position. Within thirty years Japan has stepped from a position of comparative obscurity to that of an almost first-rate maritime power. All classes in Japan take an interest in naval and military work, and the patriotism of the people has been largely responsible for her successes. The laws we have passed for the preservation of the purity of our race are calculated to arouse the animosity of nations with whom the Empire is at peace to-day, and it is at a time when there is ho spot on the sun that we should prepare to defend ourselves. I was under the impression that the Minister of Defence would announce that the Government had decided not to take any further step towards the abolition of the Naval Agreement. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to deal presently with that point. I have no desire to discuss at this stage the Naval Agreement Act, but I am surprised that the Minister, after expressing his appreciation of the protection afforded us by the British Navy, was not prepared to say that the Ministry had determined to refrain from asking Parliament to repeal the Naval Agreement Act. </para>

                        <para>- No. I am inclined to think that we shall not hear much more from the Cabinet in regard to the abolition of the Naval Agreement. I believe that they will be prepared to allow it to run its course. While our annual contribution of &#163;200,000 to the British Navy can be defended, I am not prepared to say that the withdrawal of that contribution would inflict any serious injury on the Navy or lead to Australia losing its protection. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, the British Government believe that if the Agreement were cancelled, the money now paid under it to the British Navy would be devoted by Australia to a more comprehensive scheme of naval and military defence. If we are alive to the necessities of our own situation, we ought to show the mother country that we are prepared to do for ourselves far more than has been done for us in the past. It is necessary that we should have in Australia a small arms and ammunition factory. At present we have to depend upon outside supplies, and in the event of an outbreak of hostilities in the South or Eastern Pacific, we should experience very serious difficulty in obtaining the arms and ammunition that we required. If  we are to adopt such a scheme as that now before us, we ought to lose no time in establishing a small arms and ammunition factory. I gathered from the speech made by the honorable member for West Sydney that his desire in submitting this motion was to show that it was the duty of every adult male to be prepared to defend his country. </para>

                        <para>- I have always urged that we could not hone to enforce the White Australia policy in the absence of the protecting arm of Great Britain or the capacity of our people to defend the country from invasion. My experience is that many workers in Australia to-day are not familiar with the details of the .scheme submitted by the honorable member. They&#39; have a vague notion that if we adopted it, it would involve their being dragged away from their industrial occupations to engage for some time in military service. They do not know that the proposal is really an adaptation of the Swiss system, designed to suit Australian conditions. </para>

It is necessary that the people should understand that this is not a proposal to establish conscription on continental lines, and that under it men will not be asked to serve two or three years in barracks. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to get these admissions, not so much to serve my own purpose, as to serve the honorable member&#39;s. I am with him except in regard to the age at which compulsory training should cease. I think that it should cease at eighteen instead of at twenty-one years of age. If at eighteen a lad does not realize the duties of citizenship, he wilt never realize them. Furthermore, the system will be more popular if my suggestion be accepted. A number of electors now regard it as the introduction of the thin end of the wedge of conscription ; but if it were proposed that compulsory training should cease at the age of eighteen the system would be more acceptable to them. I think that the members of the junior cadet corps should pass into the senior cadet corps, and ultimately into the militia. But we must abandon either the volunteer system or the partially-paid system. </para>

                        <para>- The Britisher is not less desirous of serving his country than is the German&#39; or the Frenchman ; but we have seen that in Great Britain even so popular and able a man as Lord Roberts cannot break down the hatred of conscription. Therefore I suggest that we should gild the pill, and better sooner than later. Some scheme of the kind suggested by&#39; the honorable member will have to be adopted. I am glad that Australia is awakening to the need for defence preparations. In the past, when military Estimates came before the Parliaments of the States or before this Parliament, there was either a cutting down of votes or a fusillade of jesting remarks. The honorable member for Maranoa, as well as myself and other honorable members, has played a part in these discussions. Nights have been occupied in ridiculing the volunteer system. No doubt much of the derision which was expressed was justifiable, because large salaries were being proposed for officers  whom we knew to be mere toy soldiers. But Parliament having jested with this matter for so long, we cannot expect the people to regard it as serious all at once. The leader of the Opposition made a very good suggestion when he asked the Minister of Defence if he would not in the near future obtain as Commanding Officer a man who had had experience in actual warfare. I do not know how that suggestion appeals to other honorable members, but it appeals very strongly to me. </para>

                        <para>- Australia should obtain the best military talent that Great Britain can spare, and Parliament should give a comparatively free hand to the officer appointed. The honorable member for Maranoa made a plea for discipline, but we must recognise the need for the strict observance of discipline amongst all ranks, Tight up to the Commander-in-Chief. Parliament, of course, must always be the supreme authority, and control expenditure, but, having made up our minds to spend so much a year on defence, and having appointed as Commanding Officer some one whom we &#34;know to be competent, we should say to him, &#34; There is the money; see that we get a suitable return for it.&#34; The only practical test of military ability is actual warfare. We have never had a war to test the practical qualities of our officers, and we do not want one. Therefore we must&#39; get a man from Great Britain, and having obtained the best that Great &#39;Britain can send us, we should repose confidence in him, and, laying down a policy, leave the details of management to him. It would be better to put details unreservedly into the hands of a strong man than to interfere in matters of administration. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. In &#39;the past, however, honorable members have wished to interfere in matters of detail. There cannot be proper discipline when such interference takes place. The honorable member for Maranoa gave us an illustration from his own experience of the advantages of discipline, and spoke of the British Tommy Atkins as the best fighting man in the world. I believe that the soldier of the future &#39;will depend more on his mental powers and his education than the soldier of the past - who has been content to be merely part of a machine, possessing no initiatives has done. The Australian soldier in South Africa showed the advantage of using men possessed of initiative. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. But Parliament must be careful not to. break down discipline by its criticism of details. I do not think that any military man worth his salt would consent to remain long in command of our Forces if he found himself subjected to criticism whenever a member of Parliament was egged on by discontented constituents to pull him to pieces. I should not like to hold the position if I were to be subjected to such criticism. While I shall always be as sturdy a1 fighter for the rights of Parliament as you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> knowing that Parliament must be supreme, and have full control of matters of policy, I think that details should be left to the man who is put in charge of our Forces. I have made these remarks without preparation, and may, perhaps, be able to say more on the subject when the Military Estimates are under discussion. I am glad that&#34; the honorable member for West Sydney has brought the proposal forward, and that the members of the Labour Party support it. I hope that the Minister of Defence will give every encouragement to the senior cadet corps, and as soon as possible make arrangements providing military training for youths under the age of eighteen years. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that the Minister was not permitted, as I am sure he would have liked to do, to give us in detail the Government&#39;s schemes for the defence of Australia in the immediate future. I recognise that since he has been in office he has devoted much time and energy, and,  if  I may say so, a great deal of intelligence to the consideration of defence questions. I am disappointed that he has found himself so seriously hampered by existing conditions. When Parliament agreed almost unanimously to the scheme embodied in the Defence Act, providing for the representation of civil power, we thought that we had solved a great problem; but we now find that we have made confusion worse confounded. At the time, an officer of distinction, who had been brought from the old country, was endeavouring t&#39;o carry out to the best of his lights a system which he had evolved, tout which, I think it will be  generally admitted, he had not in any degree perfected. The Defence Act provides for the constitution of a Military Board, and quite another system of military government, under which the valuable time of a second distinguished officer from the old country was occupied in inspecting rifle ranges and similar work, which could have been equally well done by a man who was being paid  &#163;150  a year. </para>

                        <para>- We are suffering from these mistakes; but I hope that we shall take advantage of them, and that experience, which is the most valuable of teachers, will, in this instance, prove a successful monitor. It is suggested that we should again import from the old country an officer who would be competent to take command of our Defence Forces In this connexion I ask honorable members, to bear in mind two things. The first is that in the old country military matters are in a condition of flux. They have no real adequate system of defence there. Ideas are changing, as was pointed out by the honorable member who has just resumed his seat. Lord Roberts, the greatest authority in the Empire, has discovered that he has a very hard row to hoe in the old country in endeavouring to bring about a more effective system of defence and of offence, if that be necessary. Under these circumstances, until we have decided upon the system which is to be administered it would be folly to appoint an Imperial officer to evolve order out of chaos. My second point is that it constitutes a grave reflection upon the distinguished military officers who have visited Australia during the past quarter of a century, that they should have made so little use of their opportunities as to fail to leave behind them a single pupil who is considered competent to take charge. In any great business undertaking the first necessity is that there shall be a good manager, and the second that he shall have a good assistant - a person to whom can be confided the entire conduct of the business, should the manager for any reason be unable to carry it on. We have not secured such an assistant. We have been content to import officers from the Old Country - in some instances seven or eight have been simultaneously brought out to the different States - and, it is said, they have failed to leave behind them a single person who is competent to carry on their work. </para>

                        <para>- No. The reason is that as soon as these officers have reached our shores they have surrounded themselves with such barbed wire entanglements that they were quite unapproachable. They have not merged their personalities in the military affairs of the various States. They have been too inaccessible. The same state of things exists to-day. We have a Military Board which is composed of the senior permanent officers of the Commonwealth. There were provided certain consultative members who are intended to represent the Militia Forces. But, as was shown by an answer given to a question which I put the other day, these consultative members, who are required to attend meetings of the Board only when requested, have not attended a single meeting during the past year. I complain that in this matter Parliament has not been treated fairly. When we passed the Defence Act it was understood that advantage would be taken of the services of these officers to assist the Military Board. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear the Minister say so. But instead of offering suggestions, I wish that he would take action. If he did so he would find that he would have backing throughout the country such as no other Minister has received. What we want is an effective system of defence in which every able-bodied man shall take part. Apparently it has been thought by those in authority that it is quite sufficient to pay men a few pounds a year in order to insure their absolute fidelity to a particular system. In effect we have said to them, &#34; We do not require your enthusiasm, because it will mean that you will want effect to be given to your enthusiastic projects. We want to dispense with enthusiasm, and in the case of captains, for example, we will give them  &#163;16  a year for the work they are doing.&#34; There &#34; is nothing more inconvenient to a permanent officer than the enthusiasm of the militia officer. The former prefers that the latter should be a mere registering machine. What the permanent officer requires from the militia officer is nicely -written minutes upon the various., recommendations despatched from head-quarters, and constant attendance upon him-- </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. In the early history of this Parliament I took a very lively interest in the proposed abolition of the volunteer principle. For many years I belonged to the old Victorian Mounted Rifles, the officers and men of which expressed to me again and again their great regret that they had been converted into a militia force. I stated what I had been told in the House, and the. Minister of Defence, the right honorable member for Swan, accordingly caused an order to be issued asking many of the officers who had spoken to me whether my statement was in accordance with fact. Not a single reply to that communication was in accordance with the views previously stated, but every one of these officers concurred in the opinion of the Commandant, Brigadier-General Gordon, that it was very much better to dispense with the volunteer system. Since then I have absolutely refrained from expressing opinions in regard to the matter. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and I am not likely to be left again. We must regard the system of defence which we hope to see established in Australia from a different stand-point than that from which it is. regarded by the people of the United Kingdom. We must recollect that ours should be a defence system . pure and simple. We do not desire men who are prepared to serve in any quarter of the globe, but men who will be ready to defend Australia. That must be the groundwork and basis of our defence system. If the people thoroughly understand that, I feel that the same objection will not be urged to the compulsory aspect of this proposal which might otherwise be urged: </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member that, in the absence of a thorough appreciation of one&#39;s duty to one&#39;s country, compulsion must be exercised. But I hope that we shall be able to place our defence system upon such a basis that the compulsory aspect of it will resemble the compulsory section in a certain celebrated Lands. Acquisition Act-that; in other words, it will represent merely a danger signal. I feel sure that we do not intend to sanction the creation in Australia of a military system which would of necessity : involve the withdrawal of a number of persons from their industrial avocations. The Minister, in his reply, quoted a number of figures which are very valuable, but which.; will be more valuable when he adds to them the conclusions to which he has been, driven. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister does not mind being driven by the force of figures. The logic of figures always appeals to him, and I am sure that he will not feel any degradation in being driven to a conclusion by it. I agree with those  who  have spoken of the admirable work done by the <inline font-style="italic">Call</inline> newspaper in educating the people of. Australia upon the question of national defence. The first step which must be taken in. that direction is that of educating the youth of the country. A college of instruction, to which reference has been made, would be a valuable adjunct to our military system. . If we are to have a thoroughly effective defence system, we must provide for the education of those who are to carry it out. I agree with those who deprecate the establishment of any military caste. I feel that in Australia, perhaps more than in any other country in the world, there is an utter indisposition to establish caste distinctions. The native born Australian does not care twopence about such distinctions. I feel sure that if the youth of our country can be given the necessary education to fit them for responsible positions in our Defence Forces they will avail themselves of it without exhibiting that disregard for others which unfortunately has followed the establishment of similar institutions elsewhere. I agree with the gradations which the Minister proposes to adopt in starting with the training of our cadets, and in retaining control of them until they become merged&#34; in the ordinary military ranks.  In my  opinion our rifle clubs should be regarded as a great reserve of the future army. Should we ever tie required to take the. field, it will be found that the great majority of the members of our rifle clubs have been through some course of military training; and have been subjected to some sort of discipline. In my own district, where troops of Mounted Rifles and Light Horse have been established for twenty years, there is scarcely a young farmer or storekeeper who at some time or other has not been a member of those forces. He has not. remained in them for more than two years, perhaps, but, nevertheless, he has acquired a knowledge of military discipline during the most, impressionable period of his life - a knowledge which will be of incalculable benefit to the country should his services ever be required in its defence. These men do not forget their drill. It is marvellous how quickly they recover lost ground, in that regard. </para>

                        <para>- I know that alterations are constantly being made in the drill instruction imparted. But, nevertheless, the root of all military training remains, namely, discipline, obedience, and steadiness. These are the things which have to be learned by men, and they are the things which take the longest to learn. But when once they have been learned barrack-yard evolutions are comparatively easy. Under these circumstances we need entertain no fear of the future so long as we place . at the disposal of our people the opportunities which the country demands should be placed within their grasp. The naval side of our defence system is a most important one. The establishment of naval cadet brigades constitutes a step in the right direction. I saw a number of these youths quite recently. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. When L speak of the training given to the cadet&#39;s,, the senior cadets and the militia, I realize that there is a certain training which must be most careful, and, in some arms of the service, continuous. For instance, we cannot make a horse artilleryman in a few weeks. He has to- deal with intricate machinery, and receive constant tuition,, not only in regard to present conditions, but. also in regard to improvements which maybe brought about from time to time. If we can, we should provide a system which will be sufficient for the kind of force we require - a force which is entirely for defence purposes. I have had very manyyears&#39; experience of camps; and it is painful to see men arrive in the middle of the night, or in the early morning,, after an extremely long and trying railway journey, on which they have been treated more like cattle than human beings,, pushed into sidings whenever there is; traffic which may be considered of more importance. These men are scarcely recovered from their exhaustion when they are called upon to enter upon active camp work ; and the result is that for two or three days they are at high pressure, with nervous energy very much depressed. This is rendered necessary by the brevity of the period of encampment. The period should be longer, and the work done should be of a more leisurely character. The reason for the brevity of the encampment is, of course, first, the expense, and, secondly, the limited time at the disposal of the men. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that men cannot leave their employment; but it: should be the duty of an employer to see that every able-bodied man in his employ shall be fitted for) not only the protection of the Commonwealth, but the protection of his employer&#39;s property, because, after all, that is what it comes to. There is another question in regard to which I have a notice on the business-paper, and to which, therefore, I cannot refer more than incidentally. Encouragement should be given to all ranks in the service to perfect themselves in order that they may rise higher. At present it is impossible, for some men, at any rate, to get beyond their present status ; and that is not right. There should be means whereby, in the first place, those who have, rendered full service shall be passed into the reserves, and that those from below shall have an opportunity to show whether they are capable of carrying out higher duties. Then there ought not to be a barrier between the militia and permanent appointments&#39;. A man in the militia, if he shows himself fit for a permanent appointment, should have an opportunity to fill it ; he should not be debarred simply because he is a citizen soldier. In regard to a small arms and ammunition factory, we have been promised such an establishment for a considerable time, but the project seems to be hanging fire. A little over &#39;six or seven years ago- the Government of Victoria, then a separate Colony, collected some very valuable information in connexion with the establishment of a cordite factory. At that time, of course, Victoria had to consider only its own requirements. The information was collected by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake,</inline> whose services are at present being availed of by the Commonwealth Government, and who is one of the best authorities on explosives, not only in Australia, but in the Empire. I am. sure that information would be made available for the consideration of the Minister of Defence. </para>

When these inquiries were made on behalf of Victoria, we were assured that there was a prospect of supplying considerable quantities of cordite to India, where, it appears, that, on account of the temperature, it is impossible to manufacture high explosives satisfactorily. </para>

Before we deal with the Estimates we are entitled to have before us the Ministerial proposals with regard to our system of defence. The present system has to be radically altered, because it is unsatisfactory in all respects. Even if the Ministerial scheme be a hastily formulated one, and, perhaps, not effective, we are prepared to take the risk, if the Minister will only&#39; submit it. As a well wisher, I tell the- Government that, in my opinion, grave responsibility rests upon them in regard to this matter. They are not entitled to allow this country to remain in its present admittedly defenceless condition. Nothing gives me greater pain than to utter these words. During fifteen years I have done my best, in my own way, to fit myself for defensive service, and, by showing an example, te get others to do the same: and that, perhaps, is the best course one can take. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has the advantage of all the mistakes of his predecessors, and he knows all the shoals and shallows which wrecked their projects. He is, therefore, not in the same position as they were; and he is not entitled to ask for an indefinite period of time in which to prepare a scheme. I am speaking seriously, and I ask the House and the Government to take the matter into immediate consideration. If the Government desire to retain the confidence of the Chamber in the Minister of Defence, they must not be prepared to give honorable members answers which fill us with admiration, and, sometimes, make us chortle with joy, but which, after reflection,&#39; always give us- cause for. serious- regret and disappointment. The Government must 1be prepared to come down with a clearly-defined and properly formulated scheme, which will remove once and for all the fears which, I am sorry to say, are only too well founded regarding our defences. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not pretend to have anything very new or valuable to say, but I do not like the motion to pass without a few words in support of what has been said by two honorable members who have given a great deal of time and attention to that which appears to me a most important matter, namely, .the proper defence of our country. I, to a great extent, agree with the honorable member for West Sydney in the scheme which he has submitted. The honorable member proposes that every man ought, to be trained to the use of arms and in proper drill, so that he may be prepared at .any. time to assist in national defence. The  fact that there are .some  670,000,000  of alien peoples within sixteen days&#39; steam of the Australian coast ought to make anybody, however dense and stupid, or however absorbed in his affairs, wake up to the necessity for some measure, even if it does cost a little money, to protect ourselves against foreign occupation or invasion. We have been drifting along&#39; for six years as a Commonwealth, and we do not seem to have got &#34; much forrader.&#34; However, I hear from all sides very good accounts of what the Minister of Defence is doing. The honorable gentleman has spoken a little diffidently about his powers to deal with the technical requirements of a very technical Department, being, as he says, only a common-sense ordinary man of business. I &#39;remind honorable members, however, that the best Defence Minister Great Britain ever had was a similar type of man - a business man. I refer to the late. W. H. Smith, who, it mav perhaps be remembered, was depicted iri Gilbert and Sullivan&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Pinafore^</inline> as a great stickler for polite language in the Navy. My idea is that, as a rule, the common-sense man of business is the one to have at the head of affairs, however technical those affairs may be. The alternative, of course, is to have an expert; and we all know that a mining expert, for instance, is about the worst possible man to manage a mine. I recollect that when there was a technical gunner at the head of the French military forces, and the troops were assembled for manoeuvres, it was found that, while the guns were in. splendid order, he had forgotten that troops drink water. The result was that there was no water on the field; and so this highly technical gunner made a complete mess of the&#39; organization. We have only to remember the Boer war to realize that we do not require a very highly technical man as the absolute head of the Department. .Of course, we must have the very best technical direction we can get, and m&#39;ust interfere with it, in its proper performance, as little as possible. The Minister, therefore, ought not to be&#34; diffident. We require to apply experience and ordinary common-sense principles to these circumstances; but hitherto we have lacked those essentials. We have not been sufficiently alive to the fact that we may some day wake up to .find that we have to fight for our lives. I hear very alarming reports as to the way in which the Chinese are awakening to a sense of their power. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Very soon we may find ourselves at death grips with the teeming millions of that country. The Chinese will recognise that in the comparatively uninhabited lands of Australia they may live in comfort, and they may seek to spread over our territory. We often justify the removal of the aborigines by asserting that they were making no use of the country. As a matter of fact, they were a mere handful of people, and were utilizing the lands of Australia in their own primitive way. Are we doing very much better?

                        <para>- He might before that have hurled us over, and have seen us drown. It is a rather vivid stretch of the imagination, but in fancy I picture him sitting on the bridge, and saying, &#34; We wiped out the Australians, because they were not using their country.&#34; Such a dream is possible of realization. If we do not take measures - even measures involving the expenditure of a fairly large sum of money - to prepare ourselves to defend Australia from attack, we shall run a serious risk of invasion. At all events, no self-respecting nation ought to allow itself to drift into a position in which it may find itself some day rushing into, panic. The great question is, .how . we are to properly defend ourselves? The Minister has referred to the fact that enormous crowds attend our football and cricket matches, and that it is almost impossible to work up any enthusiasm in defence undertakings. It seems to me, however, that it should be possible to make both the military and naval service attractive. I have always taken a great interest in athletics, and I feel confident that had the game of war been the fashion when I was a young man - and after all we like, to follow the fashion - I should have enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed a day on the river or any other pastime. I trust that the Minister will think out some scheme by which the people may be led to take an enthusiastic interest in our defence system. I am totally inexperienced in military matters, but it seems to me that we might, for example, have attractive displays in the Albert Park, where two regiments could be drilled before the public, and a spirit of friendly rivalry engendered amongst the&#39; men. There must be a way of inducing the people to take an appreciative interest in this work. If a popular scheme were devised, we should see our young men hastening to join the different militia regiments instead of running off, as they do now, to football, cricket, and other competitions, where they have an opportunity to display their prowess. The desire to excel is a natural ambition. A young man naturally desires to try to do well - to be the hero of the hour - and to be held in esteem by his fellows. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that the Minister is in a much better position than is a private member to devise a workable scheme, but the suggestion made by the honorable member for Kennedy, that we should offer a big national&#39; prize for competition amongst the regiments, is a good one. It seems to me that we should endeavour to make our military and naval system so attractive that it would obtain a grip on the people. . If regiments were drilled before the public, and evolutions were so conducted as to attract public attention, military feeling, which is now dormant, would be stimulated. One of the most important matters to which the Minister has referred is the training of officers. Many are inclined to think that the Boers who took part in &#39;the South African war were entirely devoid of proper leaders, training, and equipment. That was not by any means the case. Such an impression is likely to stimulate the idea that we could, in &#34;a few days, gather together a force&#39; capable of holding its own against any that might be brought against it. It is an utterly wrong and dangerous presumption. Without  good officers, we cannot expect a really capable army. I have read with great interest <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Dilke&#39;s work on the Franco- Prussian war, in which he shows that the success of the German troops was due largely to their better leading. The German officers, when occasion offered, did not hesitate to take the initiative. They displayed great wisdom and a pliability that did much to secure success. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. I believe that they won many a battle owing to the action of sub-officers, who took the initiative, and brought up their troops without waiting for orders. The French officers, on the other hand, never acted without instructions. They seemed to be afraid of their position, and their training had evidently been different from that of the Germans. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Dilke, at all events, attributed much of the success of the German troops to the superior training of their officers. We shall have to provide colleges for training our young men. As an honorable member has said, it is immaterial whether young men seeking commissions in our forces come from Toorak or Footscray ; our only desire should be to secure the best possible officers.  This is a matter which deserves the fullest possible attention. I am very glad also to learn that a practical step is to be taken towards the establishment of an ammunition and small arms factory in Australia. It goes without saying that, regardless of what it may cost, we must have such a factory. If. we do not establish it, then in time of war, when we shall require weapons and ammunition, we may find ourselves devoid of them. . I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake</inline> has been sent to the old country to inquire into this question, for I am sure that he will make valuable suggestions to the Department. He is the only civil servant who to my knowledge has made a Department pay. </para>

                        <para>. - I propose to-night to continue my remarks on the Tariff from the point at which they were interrupted last night by the reporting of progress. I have no desire to unduly prolong them, and shall confine them within reasonable limits, having regard to my duty to my constituents. I represent  a  free-trade constituency, and am expected <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the majority of my constituents, in view of my personal convictions on the fiscal question, to make as forcible a stand as I -can against the Tariff. But I am as desirous as Ministers have expressed themselves to be to have it dealt with as speedily as possible, because I recognise the disturbing effect upon trade and commerce which our discussions and the present uncertainty must have, and also because I am of opinion that when the Tariff has been disposed of the last remaining prop of the Government will be knocked away, and the days of the Ministry numbered. As an Oppositionist and a freetrader, I hail that prospect with feelings of satisfaction, although I have no personal enmity towards the Acting Prime Minister or his colleagues. In view of the great friction in the relations between the Commonwealth authorities and the States&#34;, and the irritation which exists, and which in some of the States has almost culminated in a general desire for secession, it is a singularly unfortunate thing that the Government has brought forward so drastic a Tariff at the present time. Instead of tending to allay irritation, its action is intensifying it. That is shown by &#34;the representations of public bodies, by the letters which have been published in the press, by the speeches which have been made at public meetings, and by other methods in which public opinion has been expressed. Evidently the Tariff is a source of intense irritation, annoyance, and disgust to a great majority of the people of the Commonwealth. To such a pitch has this annoyance reached, that I believe if the electors in some of the States were given an opportunity to vote &#34; Yes &#34; or &#34;No&#34; in regard to Federation, most of them would be in favour of seceding from the Union. That opinion has been expressed, in some cases in language more forcible than elegant and polite, in Tasmania, Western Australia, Queensland, and New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- I do not pretend to speak with authority in regard to the public feeling of Western Australia, but judging by the resolutions which have been carried at public meetings in that State, and the attitude of municipal councillors towards this Parliament, some of whom have gone to the length of suggesting that senators should be drowned and members of the House of Representatives shot, it is not friendly to Federation. The honorable member for Bendigo last night denounced ;the action of the Government in . placing high duties on raw materials, and spoke strongly against the duty on cotton piece goods, which, he said, was prejudicially  affecting many industries. I agree with him so far as he went; but had he gone further, he would have seen that many other duties on raw materials are affecting local manufactures. During the sittings of the Tariff Commission it was amusing to see how the makers of printers&#39; ink hailed with delight the prospect of a heavy import duty on that article, while those who have to buy it, and use it as a raw material of trade, emphatically protested against any increase. What is the finished product of one trade is, in innumerable Instances, the raw material of another. Leather is the finished product of one trade, and the raw material of many others. So, too, is iron to innumerable other things. If the honorable member for Bendigo had followed his argument. to its logical conclusion, lie should have suggested the reduction of many duties in addition to those which he specified, and I hope that when we are dealing with the Tariff in detail he will recognise the applicability of his reasoning to other duties besides that on cotton-piece goods. The duty on wire netting has occasioned an outcry throughout Australia, because it is a serious imposition upon those engaged in agriculture and in stock raising. It must be remembered that, not only have the producers to use it to protect their land from the devastation caused by rabbits, but that in some of the States they are compelled to do so by law, under heavy penalties. While the State law compels them to use this netting, -the Commonwealth law compels them to pav a &#34;heavy impost upon it. Last night the honorable member for Bendigo referred to the manufacture of wire netting as a New South Wales industry, and referred to the desire to benefit one solitary factory there as proof that the Tariff was not brought in primarily for the benefit of Victorian manufacturers. He. seemed surprised that I, a New South Wales representative should be prepared to vote against the duty on wire netting. He evidently does not recognise that the location of a factory should not affect our principles. But to-day I received a letter in which it is stated in regard to the local manufacture - </para>

                        <para>The only Australian makers of netting are Messrs. Lysaght, Sydney, and it is well known to the trade that they have always been able to obtain higher prices for their netting than rules for the imported. They make a first-class article, and the netting being loose rolled, it is preferred by many buyers, although the price is from 5 to 10 per cent, higher than the imported. For many months they have been unable to cope with their orders, and advertise daily for workmen and boys. When the New South Wales Government called for tenders last year, Messrs. Lysaght were unable to tender, having too much work in hand. When the new duties were announced they raised their price 25 per cent., being the amount of the duty, but have since gone back to the old figure. It is thought they found they made a blunder in putting up price so quickly, as it showed the public what they could expect if duty was passed at 25 per cent. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That statement contrasts strongly with what we heard from the honorable member for Bendigo last night, and shows that the duty was -riot needed. The Acting Prime Minister himself told us that the local firm was turning out 200 miles of wire per week, and that it took 600 miles to supply the local demand. The natural protection given to the local manufacturer by the cost&#34; &#39;of transport, insurance, commission, &#39;and so on, &#39;in connexion with the importation of wire netting made in other parts of the world amounts to about 10 per cent, and added to this he is able to charge from -5 to 10 per cent, more for his goods than is charged for the imported article, which proves his actual protection, apart from the proposed increase of duty, to be from 15 to 20 per cent. Surely that should be sufficient. I hope, therefore, that, later .on, the Minister will reconsider this duty, especially since it so vitally affects those engaged in our primary -industries. Another matter which was brought under my notice to-day by two members of a deputation which came from Sydney, is that the duty on paints for painting ships&#39; bottoms is prejudicially affecting docking operations in Australia. Reference was -made to this matter in a question asked to-day by the honorable member for Bendigo, and it is stated in a memorandum drawn up by several firms that the duty will have the effect of throwing many Sydney dock operatives out of employment. Tenders have been sent in at the lowest figures, based on the old duty of 4d. per gallon, with a view to bringing about the -docking of over-sea vessels in Australia, and negotiations .which . were -almost   completed have been suddenly interrupted, if they have not entirely fallen through. The effect of the dutv, I am assured, will be to compel a number of vessels to be docked away from Australia. It has been pointed out that the steamers of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, which are engaged in the Eastern trade, will dock at Singapore, those of the E. and A. Company, trading to China, will dock at Hong-kong ; while the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company&#39;s steamers, as a matter of course, will dock in the old country, and other steamers will dock elsewhere. Generally speaking, the effect of the increased duty will be to prejudice one of the most important industries that we hope to have in operation in the immediate future. -I would further point out that the  duty will not encourage any local production, because the composition used in painting these vessels is very carefully prepared, consists of expensive materials, and  involves a trade secret which is not known here. The composition which has been  manufactured locally, I am informed,  does not answer the purpose  to which it is put nearly so well as does the imported composition.  I do hope that the Acting Prime Minister will reconsider this matter. ; . He has already admitted that there are many duties which  will have to be altered. </para>

                            <para>- I think the honorable gentleman will find that there are many which will require alteration if industries  are not to be prejudicially affected. As there is. a very influential journal in this city which is constantly advocating the submission to the people of important ques tio&#39;ns pf finance, and as : that journal recently  singled out one special measure upon which  it urged a referendum should betaken, may I suggest that a similar. course should be adopted in&#39; regard to the Tariff? I sup pose that the newspaper in question can offer no reasonable objection to arefereridum being taken upon the&#39; Tariff, seeing that it so intimately affects the pocket&#39;s of every individual in the community.&#39; fi will be interesting to notice what it has to say to a proposition of this kind: Yesterday the honorable member for. Bendigo made some references td the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. But I noticed that all his remarks had reference to the recommendations &#39;of &#34;the protectionist section of the Commission, which he invariably referred to. as the reports of the: Commission  instead of one-half of the Commission. We heard . nothing whatever about the recommendations . of the free-trade portion of that body. </para>

                        <para>It was demonstrated conclusively that InterState free-trade had enormously increased the output of manufactured goods within the Commonwealth, with a corresponding diminution of the revenues of some of the smaller States. It is further evident that in this wider area of  competition those manufacturers who were lacking in equipment, capital, or energy, had fallen behind. Many of them appear not to recognise the real cause of their failure, and many looked for their re-habilitation in the form of increased  duties. . . </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. The honorable member&#39;s statement agrees with the contention which I put forward last night. I stated then that our prosperity was not attributable to the operation of the Tariff, but to the bountiful seasons which we had enjoyed - that we had prospered not as a result but in spite -of the Tariff. If the duties levied under the old Tariff had been still lower, I believe that the improvement would have been more marked. If the protective incidence of the present Tariff could be entirely swept away and a 5 per cent, revenue Tariff could be substituted for it- </para>

                            <para>- I am standing for principle now. The nearer that I can get to absolute free-trade conditions the better pleased I shall be, and a 5 per cent, revenue Tariff more closely approximates to that ideal than does a 30 per cent, or a 40 per cent. Tariff. Dealing with the alleged disability under which Australian manufacturers laboured in regard to the standard of wages paid, and the number of hours worked by their employes in comparison with the employe&#39;s of their oversea competitors - a matter into which the Commission particularly inquired - the free-trade section of that body says- </para>

                        <para>It is to be regretted that complainants either could not or were extremely unwilling to supply the Commission with definite evidence in this connexion. Statements were freely - even recklessly - made, as to the wages current in the Commonwealth and elsewhere, and also, as to the proportion of the wages&#39; cost in production. Upon investigation there was scarcely any proof of the alleged difference in wages, although doubtless there is some, while the proportions of labour cost given in -almost every instance proved on cross-examination to be exaggerated. </para>

This position has been clearly set out in most of our Progress Reports. </para>

                            <para>- The report, I have  110  doubt, is in the possession of the honorable member. Is it possible that these reports have been printed and circulated at great expense only to be put in the wastepaper basket? However, since the honorable member asks, I may say that the report is signed by J. S. Clemons, J. &#34;M. Fowler, G.  W.  Fuller, andG.  W.  Wams- ley, all men&#34; who are held in the highest&#39; esteem, both inside and outside of the House, and whose recommendations will be received with the deepest respect. At any rate, I have a very high appreciation of those gentlemen and the work they did, just as I have a high appreciation of the other members of the Commission and the work done by them. While I am compelled to disagree with the conclusions arrived at by some members of the -&#39;Commission, I recognise that they are actuated by no less worthy motives than are -those who signed this particular report. I am not one who believes in stirring up the dregs of one&#39;s mind in the endeavour to discover unworthy motives for the actions of opponents; I &#34;believe in giving my opponents credit for being anxious to do the best they can from their point of view. Because I happen to disagree with that point of view, it does not necessarily follow that I desire to cast aspersions on them or attribute to them unworthy motives.

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman can inquire from some honorable members in the Labour corner. During the last Parliament we heard allegations, almost daily, of the immense amount of dumping going on in Australia. In a moment of panic, legislation was introduced, &#39; in the form of an Anti- Trust Bill and a Commerce Bill, for the purpose of checking what was described as a great evil, which threatened our local industries with extinction. Yet the report states - </para>

                        <para>Although many allegations were made that the practice described as &#34; dumping &#34; obtained, your Commission has practically no evidence before it -that over-sea goods are shipped for sale in Australia except in the usual way of trade, in execution of orders despatched by buyers in the Commonwealth. It is, however, a regular custom of trade for shipping prices for large quantities of goods to be a shade lower than the prices for local distribution, and several manufacturers in the Commonwealth admitted that it was a system in which they themselves indulged. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">It is shown, it will be seen, that no dumping was taking place, so far as oversea imports were concerned, but that it was admitted  by  Australian manufacturers that they sometimes indulged in the practice, which honorable members opposite, who are always championing the manufacturers, so roundly condemned. I shall just read one more quotation, in reference to preferential trade- in  all cases witnesses, while suggesting the imposition of higher duties on the -productions of foreign countries, desired that the minimum Tariff should be sufficiently high - </para>
                    <para class="block">Whether against Great Britain or any other country -  to assure local industries the bulk of the requirements of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para class="block">Here we have in a nutshell the hollow insincerity of those professions of a desire to give preference to British goods. _ In the list of articles which are supposed to be singled out for the purpose of giving Great Britain preference, there is not one item in the direction of a reduction of duties. In all cases the only action has been to leave the duties high enough against the mother country to hamper it in its trade with Australia, to secure local protection, and to make the duties higher still against foreign countries; and most of the articles singled out for this left-handed kind of  preference are articles which are not sent in any large quantities by British manufacturers to Australia. I do not know what the people of the old country must think of us. They must look on us as a particularly mean, sordid, grasping, greedy, insincere community ; at any rate, we must be regarded in a most unenviable and unjust light in consequence of the clumsy efforts of the present Government and their supporters to try to persuade the British community that they are to have preference, -while, at the same time, every effort is being made to block trade in British products. We know that the whole motive behind these proposals is to secure the Australian markets for Australian manufacturers. The Government might, at least, be honest with the British public and statesmen, and say, &#34;Well, gentlemen, while willing to give you an apparent advantage over the foreigner to the extent of raising the duties against the latter, our real object is to Veep you out of our markets if we can by means  of a. high Tariff against your goods, so long as we can have similar goods produced by our own people.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- It would be better to kick this Tariff into the gutter if we cannot get one better, because it misrepresents the public feeling in Australia towards the mother country. I am prepared to give  preference to British -goods and trade throughout the Empire, but I would do so in the direction of reducing duties. What do the Sheffield and Birmingham manufacturers, who were possibly beguiled by the Acting Prime Minister into the belief that we desired to extend preference to them, think of these Tariff proposals from a preference point of view? I think we have a very clear indication of their feelings in the cables which recently appeared, and to which I have already made reference, in the press. </para>

                            <para>- The Acting Prime Minister, when he was delivering his Budget speech, spoke very hopefully about the large increase of revenue he expects to receive the ensuing year. The revenue received last year was&#163;12,832,266, and the estimated revenue for this year is &#163;13,745,200, an increase of&#163;902,934, or. roughly,&#163;1,000,000. In view of the fact that some of the largest importing firms have already cancelled immense orders placed by them on oversea markets, I doubt very much whether, in the event of this Tariff being passed, the Treasurer will receive half the revenue he anticipates. Passing away from that subject, I wish to refer to a statement made yesterday by the Acting Prime Minister in regard to the duty on harvesters. I gathered from that statement that the honorable gentleman intended at an early date&#39; to introduce a Bill to amend the Act relating to harvesters, under which local manufacturers are not permitted to charge more than&#163;65 each for their machines. The Minister told the Committee that he had been interviewed by representatives of one of these firms, who stated that they found it impossible to produce harvesters at that price, and that it would be necessary to secure a  modification of the terms. I have gone to the trouble of looking up the Tariff Commission&#39;s evidence as to the cost of manufacturing harvesters, and, by reference to page 1826, have ascertained that the actual cost of manufacture is stated not to exceed&#163;30 per machine. If we add to that the charges incidental to selling, which at a very liberal estimate cannot exceed <inline font-style="italic">&#163;15or &#163;20,wefindthattheactual</inline> cost of making and delivering one of these machines to a customer is from&#163;45 to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50.</inline> This shows that McKay Brothers make a clear profit of from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;15</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20</inline> on every harvester sold by them. Surely that should be a sufficiently high profit to satisfy any reasonable man, especially when their immense output is taken into consideration. We saw the other day a report of speeches made at a gathering to bid farewell to one of the members of this firm, who is proposing to visit the Argentine in order to expand his oversea trade. He may rest assured that he will not sell his machines there at &#163;65 each. There he will have to compete with importations from Canada and elsewhere, and, whilst he will be charging the Australian farmer&#163;65 for his harvesters, he will be getting much less from the farmer outside. In other words, we are called upon to pay high duties in order that farmers in other lands may obtain Australian-made machines at a lower price than that at which Australians are able to secure them. &#39; Coming to the increase in the duty on woollens, I would point out that it has already been demonstrated that the woollen factories in Australia. are absolutely unable to cope with the present demand, notwithstanding that, they are in full swing. </para>

                            <para>- That is what we shall fast be coming to if matters go on as at present. Would the honorable member care to see himself and his family clothed in fig leaves? A statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> D. Williams, published in one of the newspapers the other day, was to the effect that so far as this year was concerned, the Castlemaine mill would not be benefited by the increase, as orders had already been accepted which would keep the mill fairly busy for a considerable period ahead. Although this mill has booked orders for some time ahead, we are asked to impose a Tariff, that wilt have a crushing effect on the poorest classes of the community. This is to be done in order that the profits of those engaged in these lucrative industries may be still further increased. Those who have to depend upon the husband&#39;s or the father&#39;s wage to provide themselves with clothing will have to suffer under this increased Tariff. In many cases they will have to go without sufficient clothing, and this state of things is to exist in order that well-to-do manufacturers may secure increased profits. It is monstrous &#39;that these &#34; hunger and pinch &#34;- -duties should be still further increased. I hope that there will be something like a unanimous endeavour oh the part of honorable members to bring down the Tariff on the food and. clothing required bv- the poorer classes of the community. We free-traders do not want to see food taxed. Our object is to insure that the necessaries of life shall be as free as&#39; possible. We want a free breakfast-table in Australia, and as far as possible we want the clothing worn by the masses of the people to be sold at a price so low that every one mav have an abundance of proper raiment. Unlike some honorable members, I am not prepared to see -any of the people of Australia clothed in fig leaves. I do not view such a pro&#39;spect with any degree of equanimity ; but if this Tariff be passed in its present form we shall see people in Australia reduced almost to that condition. I hope the day is far distant when we shall be so lost to all sense of our responsibility to the people that we shall be prepared to allow such high duties to prevail. The only other matter affecting the Tariff to which I. desire to refer has been brought under my notice by a firm engaged in the importation of a blacking or dressing for leather. lt has been pointed out to me that this dressing is included in item 230, and is subject to a duty of 40 per cent. T,t is of a special, character, and has the effect of greatly minimizing the wear and&#34; tear on machinery belting. It does not in any way come into competition with local productions, and is specially suitable for use on belts since it causes them to run smoothly and accurately, and with less wear and tear on the machinery. </para>

                            <para>-We have to remember that there are trade secrets and special processes relating to many  of these preparations. The most that could be done under this Tariff would be to make inferior imitations of these superior articles, with the result that the unfortunate people of Australia would have to pay higher prices in some cases for articles  which do not in any way answer their requirements. I regard the whole Tariff business as a humbug, and as the least scientific method of encouraging settlement and production, more particularly -in a new country. We have a magnificent territory, possessing a variety of soil, and almost every variety of climate&#34;. It has natural opportunities waiting for the hand of man to develop, and untold wealth beneath the soil. In this magnificent country, comprising something like 3,000,000 square miles we have a population of slightly less than 4,250,000. It must be patent to any one who gives the matter a moment&#39;s consideration that what we need is not a Tariff, but an earnest effort to free our&#39; lands and settle them with millions of primary producers. We should co-operate with the States with the object of securing, the passing of liberal land laws designed to encourage settlement, and we should then endeavour to establish a proper system of immigration so that we may -have a- .sturdy&#39; yeomanry on the :soil. If possible that yeomanry should be brought from the British Isles. It is unlikely that we can obtain from Great Britain all the men we want, and when we have exhausted that source of supply we should go, not as the Prime Minister has said, to the southern countries of Europe, but to the north, where we may obtain a virile people to settle on our lands - to Norway, Denmark, and -Sweden whose people - industrious, thrifty, sober, an&#39;d law-abiding - make splendid settlers. </para>

                            <para>- I have already said that the first essential is the liberalizing of our land laws. No amount of spoon feeding of secondary industries will bring permanent prosperity, because no great nation was ever bred up in the slums of a city. We should open up the. lands of the. country, and settle our rural districts. If we do that, we may safely leave the cities to look after themselves. Every additional man who is settled upon the land will increase, the demand for goods produced in city factories. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. An enduring and vigorous nation cannot be built up solely by the development of manufactures j primary industries must first receive, attention. If we remove all restraints upon production and exchange, and give legitimate encouragement to primary production, we will be able to face the world&#39;s competition, and we shall thus base our prosperity on permanent economic lines. But if we neglect our primary resources the , coddling of city manufactures will not build up the nation. One can conceive of a fair degree of comfort and prosperity amongst a community composed entirely of farmers, but who ever heard of or could imagine a community of tailors, or of any. other branch of secondary industry?- As primary production increases, wealth increases, and by encouraging persons to cultivate the soil . and develop the latent wealth of our -natural .resources, we are providing for the rearing of . a virile , race, whereas if we encourage our people to live in the cities, and allow children to* grow up in city slums, the result, two . or three generations hence, will not be such as Australia should be proud of.

I shall make this part of my speech as short as possible, because I realize that details can be referred to during the consideration of the Estimates, and I do not wish to detain honorable members unnecessarily. I notice that universal penny postage is again proposed by the Treasurer, who tells us that the change is estimated to produce. a loss of &#163;117,000. But we are also informed that the revenue of the Department last year was  ,&#163;3,  1 29,000, while it is. estimated that this year it will be  ,&#163;3,190,900,  allowing for the estimated loss of &#163;117,000. Without committing myself absolutely to the- scheme,. I acknowledge that, in my opinion, it is nearly time that the people of the other States enjoyed the advantages of cheaper postage which Victoria has enjoyed for so long. </para>

                            <para>- If the Commonwealth finances will&#39; allow of the introduction of uniform penny postage, I think, it will be a good thing to remove the disparity to which I have alluded &#34;if a due regard to our financial liabilities will admit of accepting the proposal. Another matter to which careful attention should be given is the extension of the telephone system, and the improvement and cheapening df the telephone service, so that it mav be brought within the reach of as many, persons as possible. I am at a disadvantage in referring to naval defence, because the Minister whose Department is concerned is absent. I wish to ascertain from him whether it is the intention of the Government to replace the 9.2 guns in the forts- at Sydney Heads and other important positions with  6.7  guns, and I desire also to know what the attitude of the Government is to be in regard to the Naval Agreement. Do Ministers intend to propose the cancellation of that Agreement, or will they intimate to the British authorities that they misrepresented public opinion on the subject? It was Stated by the Treasurer that a number of Australians who were trained on the warships on this station have been sent home for a course of two years&#39; instruction to fit them for higher positions in the service, and in this connexion I wish to draw attention to a very serious statement by Lord Tweedmouth in reference to the educational attainments of Australian cadets. </para>

                    <para>Lord Tweedmouth. - Yes. There were eight for Australia, two for New Zealand, two for the Cape, one for Natal, and two for other Colonies; a total of. fifteen. I think the:  arrangement  with regard to that has not been altogether understood. It has. been imagined, that the cadets were to be. taken in anyhow. Really it only comes to this, that there are nominations given to that number of cadets, and!1 then some of them are examined in Australia. Some come to schools in England and are examined here. So far as the Colonial cadets are concerned, I think it is only right- for me <inline font-style="italic">to&#39;</inline> say that those, who have been examined out in- Australia are found- not to be up to the standard of education which is prevalent amongst the same boys in England, and a good many have been rejected. I think the idea is that this number is given without consideration of&#34; the qualities of the boys, whereas in fact a-. good many boys, have been rejected on examination. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is a serious statement, to which I . wish to call the attention of the Acting Prime Minister. We should endeavour to see that the young fellows sent home possess the education necessary to pass the examinations required of them&#39;, so that: they may not suffer by comparison with English lads. Personally, I feel somewhat ashamed of the statement which I haveread. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that a better method, will be adopted, and that boys having more chance of passing will be selected. With regard to the sugar bounty. I wish to point out that the Commonwealth  finances suffer unfairly under the present: , arrangement. Whereas the Commonwealth pays the whole of the bounty, it does not retain the whole of the Excise, three-fourths going to the States. That is a. most unfair arrangement in view of the increasing liabilities of the Commonwealth,, which will presently require us to keep all the money that we can legitimately lay our hands on. I had intended to say something about the mail contract, but I shall defer my remarks on that subject. I wish, however, to point out that no provision is. made for ocean lights, buoys, and beacons.. I do not see any provision upon the Estimates to meet expenditure under this heading. Perhaps the Acting Prime Minister will tell us whether he has provided for that expenditure? </para>

                            <para>- That selection does, not represent a final settlement of the question. The fact that another trip has been arranged for to-morrow to allow honorable members an opportunity to inspect a. couple of eligible sites, demonstrates that the Government themselves do not regard the. matter as having been finally settled. But. the absence of any provision upon the Estimates to meet expenditure under this heading justifies the conclusion that the Government are not sincere in their professed desire to settle the question. I have already spoken somewhat longer than I had intended, but when honorable members are called upon to consider such a Budget and such a Tariff they must recognise that even to indicate the various headings which we might reasonably be expected to debate must occupy at least a couple of hours. I do not think that honorable members can. say that I have unduly prolonged discussion or that I have wandered away from my subject. I thank them for the patient hearing which they have afforded me, and I promise that I shall extend to those who follow me an equal courtesy. </para>

                        <para>.- My object in rising to-night is not to discuss in. detail or to critically review either the Tariff or the Budget. I rise mainly for the purpose of drawing attention to what I conceive to be the very serious state of affairs which exists in one of the large public Departments under the control of the Commonwealth. For a very long time complaints have been made by the employes in the General Post Office, Sydney, of the treatment meted out to them. Many attempts have been made, by deputation and otherwise, to induce &#34;the powers that be&#34; to remove the administrative difficulties which have become so very objectionable to these servants of the Commonwealth. From time to time, questions have been asked in this House regarding the sweating of these employes, and we have heard explanations given by different Ministers as to the provision which was to be made for the removal of this stigma from the Postal Department. &#34; But up to the present time, there still prevails in the General Post Office, Sydney, a condition of affairs which if it were known to the public would bring the blush of shame to the cheeks of every honest man. For a Jong time, the postal employes have endeavoured to obtain the ear of the Minister and to secure justice. Their action <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> this connexion has culminated in a number of reports being called for by succeeding Postmasters-General from the heads of that Department. It is from these reports that I intend to bring proof of the actual condition of affairs existing there, rather than from the allegations which have been made by individual members of the staff. I. venture to say that when these proofs have been made public, honorable members will at least demand that some steps shall be taken to relieve these employes from the inhuman treatment to which they are subjected. I find that on the  30th  of October,  1906, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arndell,</inline> who was then Acting  Deputy  Postmaster-General, in Sydney, was called upon to answer certain allegations made by honorable members of this House in the form of questions. Accordingly, he furnished the Department with a report upon that date. The first statement made was that since the Postal Department was taken over by the Federal authority, the number of officers in the employ of the General Post Office, Sydney, had not been increased, notwithstanding that the revenue of the Department had increased by&#163;1,000,000, and that the work had increased by one-third. The position is as follows :  - Before Federation was accomplished, in  1901,  there were  242  employes in the General Post Office, Sydney, whereas in  1906  there were only  228  employes - a reduction of fourteen - despite the increase which had taken place in the business and in the revenue. That fact indicates either that the Department when under State control was overmanned - which I cannot believe - or that at present it is so grievously undermanned as to necessitate the sta&#39;te of affairs which I am about to picture. </para>

                    <para>There &#39; is one reason why this state of affairs has been permitted&#39; to continue so long. It appears that an officer high in authority there has developed a scheme known as the &#34; amalgamation scheme,&#34; the putting into operation of which has been postponed from time to time in the hope that these difficulties would eventually be overcome. This scheme was to have been introduced last year, but, owing to the pressure to which the employed were then subjected, it was found necessary to postpone action till January last. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arndell</inline> further says - </para>

                        <para>I may mention that the extent to which the working efficiency of the staff has been reduced since the transfer of the Department to the Commonwealth cannot be gauged from a comparison of the figures quoted in the first para- . graph of this report, inasmuch as apart from the actual diminution in numbers there has been a large exodus of experienced senior officers by retirement, death, transfer, &#38;c, and of smart juniors who have been selected because of their superior ability for positions in other Departments, while on the other hand there have been no corresponding importations from the other Departments to this Department. </para>

                    <para>In other words, instead of the service offering every inducement to able and experienced officers to remain, the conditions are such that they take the earliest opportunity to escape from their thraldom. There is even a worse feature. Men who desired to retire are not permitted to do so, because they have not reached the statutory age, while in other cases men have been retired, not of their own free will, but because of the action of those in control.

                            <para>- Yes. Just before Parliament met there were rushed into the Department a number of temporary hands. This proves up to the hilt the statement of officers that there has been no methodical replacing of experienced officers by permanent appointments. We all recognise that in such a Department temporary hands are almost a bigger curse than no extra hands. Efficiency can only be attained by having permanent hands, who rise step by step to the top of the ladder. No one knows better, than the honorable member for Parramatta that there is no bigger incubus, or no greater cause of delay in the work, than the. introduction of temporary men who have had no previous experience. </para>

Such conditions ought not to be permitted in any Department of State. This appeal for relief was made as far back as October,  1906,  and yet no relief has been granted. </para>

The work could certainly have been accomplished satisfactorily and without any dire effects had the element of immediate urgency in many cases been eliminated, but when a small staff, with untrained casual hands (one of whom for about three weeks was a poor demented lad who, is since an inmate of an asylum) was supposed to cope with it, little wonder it was unsatisfactory. The effect of reducing the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of a branch such as this, wherein machinery of the mail services is so intricate, has been indubitably to impair its efficiency, and has a deleterious effect upon those responsible for its &#39;proper management. </para>

The staff of that branch has not been required to take work home, because it would be impossible to do so, but it has worked at high pressure, and occasionally for overtime, though not so much as other branches. The Comptroller of Stores Branch does not appear to have worked much overtime, but the officers in it have had to work at high pressure to prevent the overtime system which has prevailed in other branches. Coming to the Senior Inspector&#39;s Department, I would point out that last year a re-arrangement was made, whereby there is now one senior inspector at the General Post Office, the other inspectors being located in different districts. Therefore, work at the head office, which was formerly divided amongst several inspectors, is now left to one man. This is what he says - </para>

There has been no expedition in fill-&#39; ing &#187;the places of those who have retired, other men having been appointed temporarily. This is evidence of incapacity somewhere. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Russell</inline> says that there were an Acting  Deputy  Postmaster-General, an Acting Chief  Clerk,  an Acting Clerk-in-Charge, an Acting Senior  Clerk  in the Miscellaneous Branch, and an Acting Appointment  Clerk,  who had been acting for four years. When a man is doing good service for the country, he should not be kept in an acting position for four years, but should, if qualified for the position, be appointed to it permanently, and, if not, it should be given to some other person. There was also an Acting Telegraph Manager, an Acting Assistant Telegraph Manager, an Acting Assistant Electrical Engineer, an Acting Cashier, an Acting Distributor of Stamps, and two Acting Inspectors. On the  31st  October of last year there were more acting than permanent officers in the higher branches of the Department in New South Wales. Is this state of affairs creditable to those charged with the administration of the Public Service Act, whose business it is to do justice to the servants of the State, and to see that the Departments are worked to the best public advantage ? In my opinion that Department has not fulfilled the functions which it was created to discharge. There were also an Acting Superintendent of Mails, an Acting Telephone Manager, scores of acting officials in minor positions, an Acting Postmaster at Tamworth, who had been acting for three years, an Acting Postmaster at Bourke, who had been acting for three years, an Acting Postmaster at Newcastle, who had been acting for over one year, and an Acting Postmaster at Goulburn, who had been acting for about a year. Amongst lower grade officials were scores of men who were only acting, but who, as faithful servants, should have been permanently appointed to their positions. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Russell,</inline> it would take too much time and paper to quote the scores, and possibly hundreds, of cases in which &#34;officers, in junior positions were acting only.  This practice of appointing officers temporarily was adopted for the purpose of reducing expenses, because the officers who were acting received lower salaries than were paid to the permanent officers, whose places they filled. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Russell</inline> asks - </para>

                    <para class="block">The  Deputy  Postmaster-General then goes on to  deal with a number of other matters; and practically bears out what I have said in regard to the officers of the Department. I do not propose to deal with those quotations now; but will direct attention to one or two other matters connected with the Department. I- was one who strongly urged the adoption of the telephone toll system. I went to some trouble to look up the history of telephoning throughout the civilized world, and to ascertain the systems which have been adopted in other countries. I urged the toll system as the most equitable, but what has been the result of its adoption. I was deprived of my opportunity to deal with the Estimates of the Postmaster-General in the last Parliament owing to the close of the session ; and I should like to say a few words on the subject now. In the adoption of a system of this kind we have to consider equity, not only as between users and the Department, but as between the public, who are the owners of the telephones, and the public who take advantage of them. The Postmaster-General knew very well at that time that no toll system in the world allowed a larger number of calls per year than  750,  and that, in some cases, the charge for additional calls was a penny, and in other cases a half-penny. But, when the honorable gentleman announced that he proposed to make the maximum number of calls the same as prevails elsewhere, and to charge a half-penny for each additional call, the whole of the metropolitan press and the commercial classes of Sydney rose like one man, and howled against the proposal, which it was said, would have the effect of depriving them of privileges they had enjoyed for years and years under the inequitable flat-rate system.. The Postmaster-General, instead of sticking to his guns, backed down and introduced a system which, to my mind, is as inequitable as the flat system. The toll system should really mean a charge according to the service rendered ; and yet city men are allowed a telephone service worth, perhaps, &#163;90 a year for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;8</inline> a year, while others are permitted to have 2,000 calls per annum for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6,</inline> with a charge of only a half-penny for subsequent calls. The public, who are the owners of the telephones, have not reaped the benefit which they ought to have reaped from the adoption of the toll system. If the system means anything it means a fair charge for services rendered within the metropolitan areas of the Commonwealth- and a fair charge to those who have hitherto had the use of a socialistic machine for their own benefit and advantage. Owing to the Postmaster-General giving way, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> is paid where otherwise <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> would have been paid ; and the additional revenue from the metropolitan areas could have been used for the extension of telephones in sparsely populated districts in order to encourage settlement. The Postmaster-General neglected his opportunity, and the present policy has my absolute opposition. I cannot, for a moment, understand how it was that such a concession was made, when I know that when the system was inaugurated it was not in the mind of the then Postmaster-General or the Department to have a maximum number of calls as now arranged. The work in the Telephone Branch has increased greatly of late. In the Sydney office the attendants are working- until 9 o&#39;clock every night, and although additional hands have been called in, it is found impossible to keep up with the work. There is much .disorganization in the branch ; and it is detestable to have to listen to the legitimate complaints of overwrought officers who express a desire to escape from their bondage. The Acting Prime Minister said that 600 odd permanent hands would be appointed and I am very glad to hear that that is the case.

                            <para>- I am not quite sure, but surely the hours which this man worked are enough to make any one stand aghast. It is no wonder that he broke down under a strain of that kind. There is another matter to which I wish to draw attention, and which, in my opinion, is very serious. It is a grievance which should be remedied as early as possible. The officers of the Post and Telegraph Department are at least entitled to respect and fair treatment at the hands of those who have to deal personally with them. There exists in the Department in New South Wales what is called a medical detective. He is a medical man employed by the Department for the purpose of inspecting or detecting officers who are alleged to be sick, or who absent themselves from duty on that pretext. I have no objection to raise to a medical man. being appointed for that purpose, or to the office which he holds. But I do say that a medical man ought to be respectful to those with whom he has to deal. He ought not to make himself repugnant to any person who has to submit to be examined by him. But I am informed that this medical man treats the officers of the Department in a most disrespectful, and, indeed, I may even say in a semi-scurrilous manner. So much is that the case that I am informed that an officer who has to undergo an examination by him dreads having to approach him at all. What then, must be the position of a female officer of the Department who may be ordered to visit this doctor, who has the privilege of pronouncing an officer well or unwell as the case may be? There is general detestation of the methods employed by him, which are repugnant to any man&#39;s sense of decency, or of ordinary fair play. I do not wish to elaborate the cases which have been brought under my notice, or to speak of the lack of humanitarian feeling, not to speak of medical sympathy displayed by the  doctor.  If I were to depict some of the cases I should have fo employ language of a very severe kind in order to do. justice to them. It is the duty of the Postmaster-General to see as early as possible that any officer of his Department who has to submit to examination by this gentleman is treated as every man may fairly expect to be treated in such circumstances. </para>

                            <para>- I am stating what I know to be facts. Is such a state of affairs to be allowed to continue in this Department, which is being given such self-denying and patriotic service? Its methods are encouraging a deterioration in the standard of service; it is sweating its officers in a manner unexampled in the annals of any public institution that I have ever read of ; it has been demanding sacrifices from them, even to the point of death in their efforts to comply with the demands of their superiors ; it is shattering men&#39;s constitutions by its inhuman processes, rendering rest and restoration impossible; it will not even allow officers time in which to eat their lunches, but makes demands on the short period during which they should be allowed to refresh themselves; it works its officers at high pressure during the ordinary hours of labour, and then imposes overtime to the extraordinary extent admitted by the  Deputy  Postmaster-General. Such a system is calculated to drive persons of feeble constitution mad. And if the army of acting officers is to be a permanent feature of the Department, then it is time that we abolished the Public Service Commissioner and adopted some more expeditious method of control. If a Department which has been following this hand-to-mouth system, which has already had one claim made upon it for blood money - and that is in itself a degradation to the whole of the Administration - is to exist under such conditions, it is time that some one raised his voice to obtain a hearing for people who are not allowed to speak for themselves. The Government ought to do justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke&#39;s</inline> widow. She has been left without a bread-winner, owing to her late husband&#39;s devotion to his duties, and the sacrifices that he made at his post. There can be no justification for the treatment meted out to him. No consideration was shown for him when he returned day by day from a sick bed to try to comply with the demands of the Department, and no sympathy was shown, even when he died, with his widow. No attempt was made to come to her rescue, although she is deserving of more sympathy than any person whose case has come under my notice in recent years. I have done my duty so far as I am able by stating the facts freely and without hesitation, and by reading from the reports of a responsible officer of the Department.  His  statements, I know from my own observations during the last four or five months, are not overdrawn or in any way exaggerated. I trust that every_ representative of other States, if he knows that a similar condition of affairs prevails there, will bring the facts before this tribunal, so that we may get to the bottom of the faulty administration that prevails in this gigantic Department, and let it be understood that it must be governed on more up-to-date principles - principles dictated by humanitarian feelings, and reflecting credit on us as the custodians of the welfare of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>I wish to state that at a previous sitting I said that I proposed to-morrow to go on with the Commonwealth Salaries Bill. I find, however, that there is no chance of our completing its consideration to-morrow. The second readings of that and the Judiciary Bill, which are inter-dependent, were taken together in the Senate, and the Attorney-General informs me that it is almost impossible to take one Bill without the other, although he said he would see whether it could be done. I propose, therefore, to go on to-morrow with the Budget debate. I wish to express my regret to the honorable member for Angas, who I know was going away by train this afternoon. The Government Whip asked me, on his behalf, if we were going on with the Commonwealth Salaries Bill tomorrow, and I said, &#34;Yes.&#34; It did not strike me for the moment that that determination specially affected the honorable member, and I express my regret to him now, because I know that he had intended to go home to-night. </para>
