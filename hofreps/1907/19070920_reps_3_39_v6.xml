                    <para> - I have seen the newspaper article to which the honorable member refers, and, on reading it, it occurred to me that the Commonwealth law could be used to prevent the creation of a monopoly, but, of course, its applicability will depend entirely upon the evidence obtainable, and it is often difficult to obtain the evidence required. In my opinion, the Australian Industries Preservation Act was framed to cope with an arrangement such as this combine in coal, and if it is found that the public are being injured, the Government will take cognizance of the matter, subject, of course, to the opinion of the Attorney-General as to our right to interfere. </para>

Whatever may be decided when we get to the Tariff, if I were to publicly announce now that the proposals relating to wire netting, chairs, or other articles were to be taken out of their order, I should have a hornet&#39;s nest about my ears.

If the Ministry proposed the postponement of most of the items of the Tariff in order to give prior consideration to some which are near the end, we should have a preliminary discussion on the whole Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to know&#39; whether the Acting Prime Minister considers the several Bills which he intends to ask the House to deal with before we proceed with the consideration of the Tariff schedule are of a tithe of the importance - from the point of view of urgency - of the Tariff itself, and whether he will seriously consider the desirableness of postponing their consideration until we have begun, at least, to deal with the Tariff schedule. Does he not think it would be advisable later on to rest in our work of dealing with the Tariff, in order to dispose of other matters which may become urgent? </para>

                        <para>- One at least of the measures I have mentioned - the Judiciary Bill - is in my opinion very urgent. I do not think that any of them should occupy our attention for any length of time. The lawyers are the only honorable members who are likely to discuss the Judiciary Bill, and they cannot talk for ever. There are various reasons why I think that the passing of that measure at the present juncture is extremely desirable, and I wish <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> see it become law without delay. The other two bills should not take long to deal with. Unless the flood gates&#39; of eloquence are opened, we should be able to dispose of them in an hour or two. </para>

In the course of a speech which, the right honorable member for Swan made in the House a few evenings ago, he referred to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and stated that when it was before the House I gave an inconsistent vote. I desire to say that the records of the House show that my attitude an respect to that measure was throughout consistent. </para>

Having carefully examined the records since making the statement in question, I regret to say that I inadvertently misrepresented the honorable gentleman. I am now in a position to say that while he consistently opposed the extension of the Bill to State public servants, he consistently voted for the inclusion of States railway employes and others engaged in industries carried on by the authority of the States. I very much regret that I should have misrepresented the honorable member. </para>

            <para>.- I rise, not to canvass this item, but to obtain information in regard to it. Hitherto the bulk of our printing has been done by the Victorian Government Printing Office, and I must say that it has been admirably executed. I desire to know whether the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2,000</inline> provided upon these Estimates is intended to be expended upon the purchase of machinery which will ultimately be installed in the Commonwealth Printing Office at the Seat of Government. Of course, it is. simply a matter of grace on the part of the Victorian authorities to allow Commonwealth printing to be performed at the  3590 <inline font-style="italic">Supply.</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Supply.</inline></para>

          <para class="block">Government Printing Office of this State, although I am aware that in each of the States capitals the Government Printing Office is anxious to obtain a portion of that work. I am thoroughly satisfied with the work performed by the State Printing Office in Victoria, and I recognise that both the present Government Printer and the late Government Printer have rendered the Commonwealth very valuable service. If there be one ground upon which we can urge a complaint, it is that our Commonwealth printing is &#34; got up&#34; too elaborately. I believe that there is room for the exercise of economy in the production of many of our parliamentary papers, so far as the quality of the paper employed is concerned, and the style in which the printing is done. The parliamentary papers of the House of Commons are not to be compared with our Commonwealth parliamentary papers, from the point of view of their general &#34;get up.&#34; </para>

              <para>- They will be. The machines will cost about&#163;1,500, without the motors, which must also be provided. The expenditure proposed is for the purchase of these machines. I know that at present great difficulty is being experienced by the Victorian Government Printing Office in coping with the work which it is called upon to do. Upon one or two occasions I have had to get printing executed in Sydney on account of the congestion of work in the Government Printing Office here. I think that additional printing will require to be done on account of the Federal Statistician&#39;s Department. </para>

              <para>- No. The Government Printing Offices of both New South Wales and Victoria have declined to undertake the printing of the publication which was formerly known as the <inline font-style="italic">Seven Colonies.</inline> I had the work sent to Sydney, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullick,</inline> the Government Printer, has refused to undertake it. I understand that a reasonable tender for the printing of that publication has been received, I think, from Messrs. Sands and McDougall. The amount upon the Estimates will be expended in the purchase of additional machinery to enable us to cope with the large quantity of printing which has to be done in connexion with Parliament and the Commonwealth Departments generally. It will be Commonwealth property, and when the Parliament removes to the Seat of Government the machinery will be duly installed there. </para>

            <para>- The remarks of the Acting Prime Minister emphasize the necessity which exists for at once establishing the Federal. Capital where we shall be in a position to erect our own buildings, and house our printing machinery. It seems to me that the constant acquisition; of further  accommodation in Melbourne only serves to accentuate the difficulty which we shall experience when we come to remove the Seat of Government from this city. I hope that we shall not continue to waste money by erecting temporary buildings in Melbourne. We must find accommodation for the housing of this machinery. </para>

              <para>- This officer has devoted a lifetime to the printing of postage stamps, and the result is that he can produce them for much less than they can be produced in any of the other States. He has been brought to Melbourne, his Department will be -established here for a dme, and then we shall have to remove it to the Federal Capital. It seems to me that we are frittering away money by acting in this fashion. If we erect temporary accommodation for the machinery which we are&#39; about to purchase, we shall have to demolish it by-and-by, whereas if we erected a building at the Seat of Government, it would be a permanent structure, to which additions could be made from time to time, in accordance with a plan which would provide for the requirements of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- The purchase of these two  linotype  machines will certainly result in a saving to the Commonwealth. I do not think that we need worry much about the housing of the machines, because the accommodation required for them will be so very small. I .think that the arrangement under which our Commonwealth printing is done by the Victorian Government Printing Office is working exceedingly well. There is, however, one matter to which the Government might devote consideration. I suggest that in future all tabular printing which has to be undertaken should be set up in such a way that it can be used, &#39; if necessary, in our official publications without involving the expense which is caused by what is technically known as &#34; overrunning.&#34; I am quite certain that a considerable sum is annually wasted by tabular matter having to be re-set. </para>

              <para>- Under the circumstances that is perhaps the wisest decision to. which the Treasurer could come. But I have thought over this matter, and I cannot help thinking that this is a triumph of parochialism over Federalism. The work could be done, and  the cry has  always  been to have it done, in the departmental office in Adelaide. It never has been contended, and it never could be contended, that the work could not be done cheaper there than  in any other Government office. Hitherto the work of printing postal stamps has been done in the States Government printing offices, except in South Australia, where it was undertaken by a branch of the Post and Telegraph Department. A proposal was made to have all the stamps for the Commonwealth printed at this one office, as the most economical plan to adopt. </para>

              <para>- What I complain of is that, having; brought this officer to Melbourne, and placed him under the control of the Treasurer, the Government are going to&#39; continue the old and expensive system of producing the stamps in a State printing office&#34;. I do not complain of any action of the present Treasurer ; but merely regret that there is not sufficient Federal spirit to permit of the work being done in the place where it has been proved to be done most cheaply. This happened to be the only Commonwealth work done in Adelaide, and it is a pity that parochialism has triumphed in the matter. </para>

            <para>. -On several occasions I have referred to the difficulty which is occasioned owing to the fact that the Commonwealth has .not a printing office of its own. The gentleman in charge of the State Government Printing Office in Melbourne may be one of the best in the world; but the fact remains that he is under the control of the State Parliament. The officer who has been brought over from Adelaide and the linotype engineer are the only two officers who are Federal servants. That is not a proper position for the Commonwealth to occupy. Time after time we have voted large sums of money for the purpose of purchasing printing machinery, until to-day, I think, it would be difficult to ascertain how much of the machinery in the printing office belongs to the State and how much to the Commonwealth. There ought to be a return giving full particulars. </para>

              <para>- But that suggestion has been made ; and, so far as I know, it is unjust to representatives of Victoria. Had it been known that the seat of Government would remain in Melbourne for six years, and, in all probability, for so.ne &#34; time longer, steps would have been taken at the outset to establish a printing office of our own so that we might have complete control of the machinery arid officers. </para>

              <para>- But the Commonwealth, has paid for the machinery in the Government Printing Office. A reference to past Estimates will show that we have paid many thousands of pounds for machines that are being used not only for Commonwealth work but also for State work. I&#39; was given to understand some time ago that the Victorian Government do not possess a linotype, but that they use the Federal linotypes for their own work.

The Government Printing Office is, to some extent, under divided control ; and so long as the present state of affairs continues we can never ascertain exactly how the business is carried on. The officers are not Commonwealth officers, and probably deem it their duty to be more loyal to the State than to the Commonwealth. I trust that the Treasurer will look into the matter and ascertain exactly how much machinery the Government possess in the State printing office. If Commonwealth machinery is used for State work we ought to be given credit for that in the account which is rendered against the Commonwealth. We hear a great deal about Federal extravagance, but I believe that charge to be untrue; and I hope that we shall not be called upon to pay more than is necessary for any printing work that may be done for us. I understand that there is a sum on the. Estimates for the purchase of two more linotypes ; and if the State uses these machines we ought, as I said before, to receive credit for the work. </para>

              <para>- We should have a Commonwealth Printing Office even before we go to the Federal Capital. We rent offices for the transaction of other Commonwealth work, and we could just as easily rent a printing office. It has been said, though I do not know with what truth, that the Commonwealth pays overtime rates for a great deal of the work which is done, with the result that the expenditure is much larger than it ought to be. As a printer myself, I know something of the cost of printing, and I have been surprised at some of the charges made. I may say, however, that the work itself is entirely satisfactory. </para>

              <para>- No. The power of the Committee extends only to the papers submitted. There is, in my opinion, a great deal of unnecessary printing at the present time, at the instance of Departments, or under Act of Parliament. The Printing Committee has been able to  effect some savings, and, with complete power, it could doubtless effect more.  I trust that the Minister will see that an exhaustive inquiry is made to ascertain the value of the Commonwealth plant, and the manner in which it is used, and that he will obtain a statement showing whether what we pay for our printing is a reasonable or unreasonable amount, and whether it would be cheaper to have our printing done in a building of our own, under Commonwealth supervision. .&#39; </para>

              <para>- The original arrangement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner when Treasurer, in his desire to effect economy, and economy has always been aimed at in Commonwealth administration, notwithstanding the charges of extravagance which have been brought against it. I have instructed the Secretary of my Department to cause a thorough investigation to be made to ascertain how the Commonwealth is now being treated in the matter of printing, and whether it would cost more than we now pay to set up a printing-office of our own. It is quite possible that the arrangement under which Commonwealth work is done in the Victorian office is not so satisfactory now that the Commonwealth Departments have largely increased in size as it was when first entered into. I cast no doubt upon the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the State in the matter of printing, .and I hope that inquiry will show that the statement that the Commonwealth has been overcharged for its printing is incorrect. With regard to the South Australian officer whose transfer has been referred to, he has been represented to me as the best man we could get, and arrangements are being made for him to do the work here. I understand that he does not desire to be placed under the Government Printer, and that therefore there is some little difficulty about accommodating him in the Victorian Printing Office. </para>

              <para>-No. It will be necessary to have a return prepared to get that information. If it is found that we are paying as much for our printing now as would enable us to have a separate office of our own, without doubt we should make a change. It. is desirable that we should have an office of our own, if in it we could get our printing done for as little as it now costs. </para>

            <para>.- The text upon which the Acting Prime Minister has hung his remarks is the word &#34; economy,&#34; and in this connexion I should like to call attention to an example of the manner in which the Commonwealth machinery and plant in the Victorian Printing Office is being used. A wealthy French gentleman interested in architecture, the Vicomte de Fenelon, has produced plans illustrating the construction of the Ark, the Tabernacle, and the Temple of Jerusalem, and has been kind enough to forward a copy of them to the Federal Parliament. The Library Committee, or the Printing Committee, has caused them to be bound in covers measuring 39 inches by <inline font-style="italic">26&#189;</inline> inches, made of green morocco, the most expensive leather procurable, and highly decorated in gold. In my opinion, the money would have been better spent in procuring works on the history of Australia. </para>

              <para>- It would be a very costly matter to move it. We have been told that, year after year, the Commonwealth printing plant in the Victorian office is being added to, and although we have asked what machinery the Commonwealth now possesses, we have not been given satisfactory information on the subject. I understand that, in the first instance, Parliament was led to believe that the machinery in the Victorian Printing Office would be sufficient for the printing of Commonwealth papers, but ever since the present arrangement was made, we have been putting in new machinery, until perhaps by now we have enough to fit up an office , of our own. Another matter to which I wish to refer is that on page 40 of the Estimates in chief, provision is made for the payment to the Government Printer of . &#163;150 for services rendered in connexion with the printing of Parliament. I am informed that he is compelled to return that amount to the State Government. </para>

            <para>-- I. should not have risen again to discuss this item but for the admission made by the Minister that it is proposed to gather together the printing plant of the Commonwealth, some of which apparently has been lent to the Victorian Government. Several honorable members have spoken about the use of machinery, and it has been said that an expert stamp printer in the printing office at the General Post Office; Adelaide, is to be transferred to this State. I do not wish to discuss the qualifications of that gentleman, but would remind the Committee that in all the States we have men engaged in printing stamps who, unless they are to be transferred to the central office, will be deprived of their livelihood if trie whole of this work is in future to be carried out in Melbourne. We ha,ve a stamp printing staff in New South Wales, where the stamps issued far outnumber those used in any other State. </para>

At the end of each session honorable members are -supplied with bound copies of the Commonwealth Statutes.

              <para>- Every member Df the legal profession must have them, and every well appointed library also has them on its .shelves. At the present time a private firm in Victoria is printing the Commonwealth Statutes, and making a good! thing out of the work. The community is practically being fleeced. I hold that our Statutes should be issued as cheaply as possible. They cannot be purchased at any of the Government printing offices im the States. </para>

              <para>- I am simply suggesting that we should make reasonable use of the Government Printing Office. The good Socialism that I have to suggest is that the Government Printing Office should print and bind the Commonwealth Statutes, and sell them to the general public. They have to print and bind them for honorable members, and I think that the adoption of my suggestion would lead to a considerable reduction in the cost to the public. </para>

            <para>.- I do not intend to oppose the item immediately under review, nor do I desire to blame the present Treasurer for the way in which the stamp* printing office attached to the General Post Office, Adelaide, has been treated. I have no hesitation, however, in saying, that it has been most scandalously dealt with. Every Postmaster-General who has inquired into this question has found that the&#39; cost of printing, stamps, postal notes, and post cards in South Australia is considerably less than it is in any of the other States. The officer in charge of the work there is a specialist. The question has been threshed out in this House year after year, and although each succeeding Postmaster-General has agreed that a certain sum shall be expended on the plant in South Australia, his decision has been overruled, not by his colleagues, but by a departmental officer. From time to time, the several Postmasters-General have had to play second fiddle to an officer in the public service. , That is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. The South Australian office has been most scurvily treated, and we know full well that this money will not be spent in that State. The Government are breaking up the printing plant attached to the post-office there, and the expert officer to whom I have referred will be placed in an almost intolerable position since in the Commonwealth office he will mot have absolute control of the work in which he is an expert. I have every reason to believe that we have. paid thousands of pounds more than we ought to have done for our printing. A Commission, consisting of experts, ought to be appointed to inquire into the whole question; something more than a mere examination . or inquiry by a departmental head is necessary to ascertain the facts. Although I consider that South Australia in this respect has been badly treated, I am not going to vote against an item providing for the purchase of plant and machinery - in many cases, the purchase of machinery means not extravagance but economy - but I think that the Treasurer should cause to be prepared an inventory of the printing plant owned by the Commonwealth in order that we may know exactly of what it consists. It is absurd to suggest that the passing of this item should be delayed until the Capital Site question shall have been decided. I was under the impression that it had been settled. It seems to me that we shall never see the Federal Capital until the people of New South Wales are prepared to agree among themselves as to what they want. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will show that when a site was finally decided upon every leader in the House&#39; urged honorable members to stand by the decision, but it seems that honorable members are at liberty to go outside and advise the people of New South Wales that they have been &#34; tricked.&#34; </para>

            <para>.- I do not agree with those who desire to establish a Commonwealth Printing Office in Melbourne. .In my judgment, it would be a! great mistake to do as they suggest. Those who advocate the establishment of our own office here appear to have overlooked the fact that apart from the purchase of linotypes, a great deal of expenditure would have to be incurred in securing other machinery. In looking over the general Estimates I find that there is an item set down as an honorarium to the Government Printer- </para>

            <para>.- I hope that Ministers will speedily come to a definite conclusion as to what is to be their policy of defence. It is really too much to ask the Committee to vote even an instalment of what &#34;must eventually be a very large expenditure, in the absence of a defence policy deliberately arrived at. In the first place we require information as to what is to be the proportion of expenditure upon the Military Forces to that upon the Naval Forces. We wish to know whether we are to look to a highly-trained small force or to an imperfectly -trained large force as the basis of our land defence. Personally I confess that I am absolutely <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> a fog over defence matters. As far as a laymen can do so, I have endeavoured to follow the development of a defence policy in the United Kingdom, thinking that &#39;it might afford me some guidance as to the policy which should be adopted here. But when I find such authorities upon defence matters as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arnold</inline> Foster taking one view, and Lord Roberts another, I admit that I am bewildered. The former believes in a small, perfectly-equipped force,0 whereas Lord Roberts advocates the establishment of a force of something like 900,000 men. In this connexion I also recollect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane</inline> recently brought forward a scheme which, having passed through the crucible of a good deal of criticism, has now been placed upon the statute-book of the Imperial Parliament.  His  scheme provides, amongst other things, for the abolition of the militia, which some experts think is an absolutely suicidal policy. When I read these conflicting opinions on the part of experts it makes me hesitate to sanction a large expenditure upon defence. Shortly before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane&#39;s</inline> scheme was approved by Parliament, an attack was made upon it by certain voluntary associations which study defence matters very closely. Lord Roberts himself subscribed to a circular . sent out by one of these associations as a protest against the adoption of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane&#39;s</inline> scheme. What is a layman - a man of peace - who does not care to board a vessel even for the purpose of making a short trip, to say to a proposal to expend a large sum upon defence, seeing that every plan brought forward by the British Government has been &#34; riddled&#34; by experts? When I come to consider our local defences I am in precisely the same &#34;pickle.&#34; Towards the end of 1906 &#39;Captain Creswell presented a report to Parliament which seemed to modify, if it did not altogether reverse, the report which he prepared upon naval defence about four years previously. At that, time, if I am not mistaken, he pinned his faith in the matter of Australian defence to an expenditure upon cruisers. He now suggests that we should commence with torpedo boats, torpedo boat destroyers, and some other class of vessel, the name of which I have forgotten. Captain Creswell very pertinently asked &#34; Why is the Navy neglected?&#34; In looking up a few notes upon this matter which I made at the time, I find that that officer set down the total of our Naval Forces at something less than 1,000. </para>

              <para>- Captain Creswell set down the number of the permanent forces at 164, and that of the naval militia at 781. He estimated our land defence forces, at 40,000, I presume upon a war footing. Major-General Hutton is a firm believer in a highly trained body of troops coupled with rifle clubs. He has declared that something like 25,000 troops form the nucleus of our army in time of peace, and that the number could be raised to 40,000 in time of war. Captain Creswell, I repeat, asks why we are spending such large sums upon our land defences whilst the Navy - which is our first line of defence - is altogether neglected. In this connexion he mentions that we have a trade valued at something like &#163;140,000,000 annually to protect. He points out that during the recent war with Russia the loss sustained by Japan on account of the interruption to her sea commerce was about ;r&#163;i 50,000 per day. When we consider the far greater ease with which the world&#39;s , trade with us might be intercepted, it becomes apparent that its interception would involve us in a very serious loss. Therefore we are justified in expending a larger sum upon naval defence. When the Prime Minister spoke of this matter in June, 1905, he pointed out that we are within striking distance of sixteen foreign naval stations. Speaking upon the Defence Estimates in 1906, he said - </para>

          <para>The Government have decided to recommend the establishment of harbor and coastal defence, and to commence by ordering eight coastal destroyers and four first-class torpedo boats. </para>
          <para class="block">He estimated the cost of these vessels at about .&#163;700,000, which was to be distributed over three years, and which would thus involve the Commonwealth in an annual expenditure of . approximately ^2&#39;50,ooo. That is a very large expenditure, and the burden of my complaint is that we are asked to sanction even instalments of a large defence vote before some systematic plan of defence has been laid down - before it has been decided whether the Navy or the Army is to be our chief line of defence. If the two are to be depended upon we should be told what is to be the proportion of&#39; expenditure upon each. I have already said that-  1  was rather sceptical in looking for guidance to the experts at home, and certainly confusion becomes &#34;worse confounded&#34; when I look for guidance to the experts here. Some two years ago,  Colonel McCay,  then a member of this. House, who had devoted a great deal of attention to military matters, referred to the estimate by Major-General Hutton, in connexion with the equipment of our forts, some of which are dealt with in the Estimates before us. Major-General <inline font-style="italic">Hutton</inline> estimated that a sum of over &#163;520,000 would be required to put our forts in order ; and of that estimate two instalments have been spent. I forget what balance remains ; but if I am not mistaken, some time afterwards, the Council of Defence increased that estimate to &#163;1,300,000 or &#163;1,400,000 - an absolute staggerer. Then Captain Creswell suggested that there should be torpedo boats and destroyers, though Lieutenant-Colonel Bridges, some twelve months ago, or it may have been last December, rather discounted the report of Captain Creswell, asking where the men would be obtained to man the vessels. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps not; but at present, I am dealing with the recommendations of experts. Before relying on the conflicting testimony of experts, or even the contradictory reports of individual experts - because sometimes individuals cannot be consistent for two years together - some thoroughly thought-out plan ought to be presented by the Minister of Defence. For all I can see to the contrary, the items before us are merely instalments for the carrying out of an immature policy; and we ought to remember that if we sanction this expenditure we shall be compelled to approve of further expenditure next year. I acknowledge that this is an exceedingly difficult question ; but I believe the Minister is doing his best, and I hope that, as soon as time permits, he will submit some well-considered, consistent scheme of local defence. </para>

We have had as many schemes of defence as&#39; there have been Ministers of Defence during the life of the Commonwealth. Each Minister of Defence has proposed or initiated some new development, aided by the inquiries of Commissions, and so forth ; and yet we are still without any definite proposals. Surely the Government ought to be able to give honorable members some final indication of their defence policy. </para>

              <para>- That is true; but since then, the Prime Minister has been in communication with the Imperial authorities, and he ought to be in a position to afford us further information before we are asked  to sanction this expenditure. I understood from the Acting Prime Minister, last night, that before we entered into the consideration of the detailed expenditure in this Department he would make some general statement as to the policy of the Government. </para>

          <para class="block">We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that Japan has leaped into the very fore front as a belligerent nation; and that she displays a capacity for defence and offence equal to that of any European power. It would be a menace to Australia if, as an adjustment of the present political situation, the Philippine Islands, which are at present owned by the United States - and generally regarded as a nuisance by that nation - should pass into the possession of Japan. This possibility gives rise to the gravest considerations; and in a great question of national policy such as this, the Federal Government should, in my opinion, act in conjunction with the Imperial Government. If we are as friendly as we always hope to be with the United States, we ought to know whether negotiations of the kind I have indicated are being conducted, and if so, Great Britain, in the interests of Australia, ought to have an opportunity to take possession of the islands to which I refer, rather than that Japan should be allowed to do so. It is idle to shut our eyes to the fact that complications are arising and are doing so very rapidly. Hordes of eastern people are rushing into the United States and to Canada ; the Japanese particularly are rapidly emigrating to the western coast of America. The treaty between Great Britain and Japan just now affords us an element of protection ; but if Japan gets control of the Chinese and Malay races, to whom the sacrifice of life is as nothing, we shall not be able to idly contemplate a combination of alien races so near our Northern Territory. </para>

We are not legislating only for our own time, but building up a nation here which we hope to see defended and perpetuated by our children and our children&#39;s children. The situation is one of the gravest importance. It is not for us to simply consider whether a few items on a Budget statement are to be passed. We have adopted, after full consideration, a policy of exclusion. Do honorable members mean to tell me that that policy will not for all time be an invitation to eastern nations to resent the differentiation involved ? </para>

I am thoroughly in favour of sustaining a  White  Australia policy as far as we consistently can ; but we must mot dig our heads into the sand, believing that all is safe. At the present time great political changes are taking place; and it is idle to suppose that&#39; China, which is awakening, and Japan, will allow us always to maintain our present position. We must be able to declare that we will uphold our policy, even at the sacrifice of our lives; or we shall be in danger. Our first line of defence is, of course, the Imperial Navy. I hope that the Prime Minister will soon be restored to health, and able to take his place in Parliament. Every one desires to see that consummated with all possible speed. I hope that when the Prime Minister returns to his place in this Chamber he will recant the suggestion that Australia&#39;s contribution under the Naval Agreement should cease. </para>

              <para>- I agree that a contribution of only &#163;200,000 per annum towards the upkeep of the Imperial Navy is as a drop in a bucket. Our contribution is practically merely a sentimental recognition of our dependence on the Imperial Navy as our first line of defence. It is unquestionably desirable that we should show our loyalty to the British Government in this matter, and it would be idle to speak of Australia as independent of Great Britain in regard to defence. But for the treat between Great Britain and Japan, thousands of Japanese .would pour into Australia as they are pouring into Canada and the United States, and our legislation prohibiting their entry would be in vain. </para>

              <para>- Yes, if we were left to our own resources. I&#39; should be the last to wish to place a wrong interpretation on the actions of the Prime Minister in London. I think that he did magnificent work there, and that no one has the interests of Australia more at heart. But, in mv opinion, he did not realize the effect of his suggestion that our contribution under the Naval Agreement should be discontinued. He appeared not to see how little importance the authorities at home place on the mere amount of the contribution. Their reply to him was, &#34; The contribution is of no material consideration to us, and if Australia feels it to be burdensome, we are willing to dispense with it.&#34; In my opinion, Australia was placed in rather a humiliating position by the Prime Minister&#39;s suggestion. English statesmen attach ho importance to the contribution as a cash assistance. </para>

              <para>- Financially, it is of no importance. The Prime Minister was quite right in pointing out that we provide for local defence in addition to our contribution to the Imperial Navy. The view the Imperial Government took was that, if we did not wish to contribute to the upkeep of the Imperial Navy, it was prepared to recognise our efforts in providing for our defence by establishing a local fleet. The point I am making i,s that the question of defence is of the greatest magnitude and importance, but although it is seven years since the States federated, no definite  policy  has been announced in regard to it.  Surely  that is an unsatisfactory commentary  upon  the ability&#39; of those who control our Defence Department, or an evidence of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> difficulty of passing sane legislation through this Parliament. We are all wishful that provision shall be made for the defence of the possessions which we have acquired or which our forefathers left to us ; but no definite defence  policy  has been announced by the Government. In my opinion, we cannot weaken our connexion with Great Britain in regard to defence. I wish to see harbor defences perfected, and a coastal fleet established for the training of our own men, and I regard the Permanent Force  only as a nucleus round which the citizen force will gather. It has always been my belief- that we shall not be in a position to defend ourselves until every able-bodied man in the community has been trained to use a rifle, and that this training should commence with our boys at school. We must also use every endeavour to increase the settlement of our country by people of our own race and blood. I hope that we shall soon have a statement of the intentions of the Government in regard to defence, which is of vital importance. </para>

              <para>- I know that &#163;200,000 is not our proper proportion. The Imperial authorities cannot resent the desire on the part of the people of Australia to provide for their own defence, and will, no doubt, be willing to allow the Imperial warships to remain in our waters while we are making our arrangements. It would be very harmful to Great Britain and&#39; the Empire at large if Australia, which is part of the Empire, were attacked, and perhaps captured, by a foreign foe. We must make a start some time in providing for our own de fence, and &#163;200,000 a year would pay the interest on an expenditure of  &#163;5,000,000,  which would enable us to do a good dea&#39; by way of a beginning. I do not advocate the borrowing of money by the Commonwealth, but, as we may be called upon, to expend in connexion with defence amounts larger than could be provided out of current revenue, we might perhaps borrow for the purpose, establishing a sinking fund for the wiping out of the debt, and! the present naval contribution would provide the necessary interest. </para>

I hope that, in regard to defence, as in other matters, we shall do all we can to manufacture our own requirements, and that the craze for cheapness will not cause the authorities to purchase abroad materials which can be made here, even though they may cost a little more than if they were imported. </para>

I am informed that at present the whole of our troops, and especially the light horse divisions, are inadequately equipped. During the South African war it was found absolutely necessary that the accoutrements of the troops should be of a colour that would not be visible to the enemy at any great distance. I understand, however, that many of our troops are still wearing white canvas belts and the old-fashioned white canvas haversacks. They should be provided with accoutrements of a dark colour. </para>

              <para>- The objection to canvas bandoliers is that in wet weather they shrink to such an extent that it is almost impossible to extract cartridges from them, whilst in hot weather they become so loose that the cartridges often fall out. I think we should also provide our mounted men with regulation saddles. I see no reason why the class of men now joining our forces should be required to provide their own saddles. Those with whom I have come in contact are some of the finest men in the Commonwealth. Our mounted forces are largely recruited from the farming class - from men raised on the land - men of intelligence, who might well be intrusted with the care of regimental saddles. It would be understood, of course, that saddles so supplied should be used only on parade, or at encampments. There is often a difficulty in replacing lost straps of regulation pattern when the men have to provide their own saddles and bridles, and I trust that my suggestion will be adopted by the Department. Another point that I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister is that many of our mounted men are without swords. If they had to take the field tomorrow, they would thus be at a considerable disadvantage. </para>

Another complaint is that at present there is no means of supplying the troops with maps. At the last military encampment in the neighbourhood of my electorate, the colonel in charge was fortunately connected with the. surveying profession, but he had to go to considerable trouble to compile, from various county maps, a map of the country over which the troops were to be manoeuvred. </para>

            <para>.- In this subdivision, we have the item - &#34; Cadet Rifles and Spare Parts, &#163;10,000,&#34; but no provision is made for cadet ammunition. I do not know whether the . 303 ammunition used by other branches of the service is served out to cadets, but I understand that there is, at all events, a difference in regard to the weight of the cordite used. So far as I have been able to ascertain, the cadet ammunition is supplied entirely by the Colonial Ammunition Company and for a long time many complaints have been made in regard to it. To all such complaints, addressed to the Military Branch of the Department, there has been received the stereotyped reply that the bad results obtained at practice were the fault, not of inferior ammunition, but of faulty shooting. We have to remember that our cadets pay a proportion of the cost of the ammunition used by them, and it should be our endeavour to encourage their efforts to become 3604 <inline font-style="italic">Supply.</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Supply.</inline> marksmen. They devote every Saturday afternoon, when there are so many  counter  attractions, to an effort to acquire skill in the use of the rifle, so that when they grow up they may be ready to take their place amongst our active soldiery, and we ought to give them every encouragement. As indicated by a question which I put the other day to the Minister of Defence, the Department refused to conduct tests to determine whether or not faulty ammunition is supplied to the cadets; but the grievance became so acute that the National Rifle Association of New South Wales decided to do so. They supplied three of their best marksmen with Eley ammunition, and also with some of that served to the cadets, and the result of the test proved conclusively that the cadets were being supplied with ammunition that was absolute rubbish. </para>

              <para>- When the sitting was suspended I was emphasizing the necessity for remedying the wrong which has been inflicted upon our Cadet Forces by selling them defective ammunition. There is just one other matter connected with our Cadet Forces to which I wish to direct attention. I should like to know whether it is not possible for us to make some provision by which our boys may be drilled, even if they do not possess a uniform. I can understand that a uniform appeals strongly to the juvenile mind, and that the members of our Cadet Forces are very proud to wear it. But a great many of the pupils in our schools are denied the requisite training simply because they are bound to pay a proportion of the cost of the uniforms with which they must be clothed. Whilst there is a good deal to be said in favour of having the lads uniformed, our first aim should be to have them trained, so that they may be eventually converted into soldiers. I come now to another matter. In our Volunteer Forces and our militia are a great many public servants, particularly postal officials. In New South Wales these postal officials were refused permission to attend the last encampment unless they supplied and paid a substitute to discharge their&#39; ordinary duties. That is a very undesirable state of affairs. The opportunity to attend the annual encampment should certainly be afforded these officials. I know of one instance in which a letter-carrier offered to deduct the period during which he was attending the camp from his annual leave, but even that offer was declined by the Department. </para>

              <para>- I am very glad to hear that, because it removes a grievance which was rankling a good deal in the breasts of some of our postal officials. I am pleased to notice that provision has been made upon these Estimates for the purchase of heliographs, and I also congratulate the Minister upon the vote which wo agreed to yesterday for the purchase of sites upon which to establish signalling stations at Bellevue Hill and Gore Hill. In my opinion, we need to pay more attention . to the question of signalling, and especially to heliograph signalling. It is to be regretted that most of the developments which have taken place in the Defence Department have been due to effort not on the part of the Permanent Forces, but on the part of militiamen. </para>

              <para>- I wish also to emphasize what appears to me to be the excessive cost of the uniforms and equipment of officers. At the present time there is a great dearth of officers, and the fact that it costs a man nearly &#163;50 after he receives his commission to acquire the necessary uniforms is not very encouraging. We ought to do more to make it possible for any man who is capable of commanding his fellows to enter the ranks and -obtain his commission. </para>

            <para>. - I shall offer no objection to this item, large though it appears to be. But I wish to protest against the way in which we are spending huge sums upon defence in the absence of any definite plan or purpose so far as a defence policy is concerned. For some years we have been promised a revised defence scheme. In this connexion it is a calamity to Australia that within seven years we have had six or seven different Ministers of Defence. While these constant changes are going on it is impossible to get a continuous policy either evolved or carried into effect. To-day matters are worse than they ever were before, so far as the development of a defence scheme and the efficiency of the Department are concerned. </para>

              <para>- I do not intend to argue the matter. I merely ask a question, to which I hope to receive an answer. A little while ago - and the matter has already been referred to by the honorable member for Kooyong - a previous Minister, in the person of  Colonel McCay  - who, I venture to say, brought as much ability to bear upon the control of that Department as has any Minister who preceded him, or as have any of his successors - had in his mind a definite scheme which he desired to see carried out. He adopted the scheme which had been outlined by Major-General Hutton, who returned to England before it had reached fruition.  Colonel McCay,  as Minister, adopted that scheme, and in a forecast which he made, I think immediately after he left office, he intimated that  &#163;800,000  would be required to carry it out. I should like to ask the Minister whether we are asked to vote this money in fulfilment of that scheme? If that be not so, has another scheme been evolved, or is another scheme in progress, and, if so, what is that scheme? It is becoming a positive scandal that, after seven years of evolution of many schemes for the defence of Australia, we are yet voting money in the dark - that we do not know whether it is to be applied in connexion with any scheme outlined by a responsible Minister. It will, I think, shorten the debate if the Minister will be good enough to answer those questions. </para>

            <para>. - In regard to the items before us, which are practically ordinary annual votes, I have not much to add that will assist honorable members. However, in reply to the honorable member for Parramatta, I should like to draw attention to one or two facts. The honorable member spoke highly of the administration of my predecessor in office,  Colonel McCay,  by whom the Board was created. The proposal for the appointment of a Board was made by the Government of which the right honorable member for East Sydney was leader. I presume that every honorable member feels that in the control of a Department, a Board is dangerous, though, after all. it may be the only possible means of control. If Australia were able to obtain the services of a Bismarck, a Napoleon, or a Kitchener, I would depend upon such men rather than a Board. The difficulty, however, has always been that, even when Imperial officers have been imported, the salary offered them has been such as would net secure the services of a Kitchener or a Roberts. </para>

              <para>- Whatever may be said about patriotism, ability, and so forth, we find, in the ordinary business of the world, that if we desire the services of men of high qualifications they must be paid adequate salaries. However patriotic our Hamiltons or Hector Macdonalds may be, we cannot obtain their services unless we pay them higher salaries than Australia has offered up to the present. I think that the House, when it approved of the Board system two or three years ago, determined that it should have a fair trial. The Board is on its trial now; and I do not see why it should not succeed, if it be composed of competent men. Nearly all the work worth doing in the world is one man work; but at the same time, I do not see why a Minister, supported by a Board of four or five able men, even though that plan is not quite in accordance with our ideas, should not succeed. I am quite satisfied that if any ordinary intelligent layman were prepared to devote himself to the service of the country, and were permitted to remain long enough at the head of the Defence Department, he could do very good work with the assistance of a Board. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Angas is probably thinking of the general Council. If a layman were placed in the position of Minister of Defence, and allowed to remain in office long enough, he would succeed, I think, in satisfactorily administering the Department.

I know that any member who is called upon to fill the position will, after three or four months&#39; experience, take a view of defence matters very different from the view he now entertains. The sense of responsibility grows and overpowers one. It must be felt by the Minister that, for the time being, the defence of the country is in his hands ; and no one would like to think that he had occupied the position for any length of time, and had left the defences in no better state than he found them. Frequent changes in administration is but one of the defects of the system of party Government. In regard to the Board, I repeat that I do not see why a Minister, assisted by a number of competent men, should not succeed in the administration. </para>

              <para>- I do not say that at all. I believe that Parliament, the Government, and the people are prepared to give the Board system a trial. There are various ways in which the House can express its views on the question, but what form may be adopted I do not know. At present the intention of the Government is to loyally aid and, as far as possible, assist the Board. The interjection of the honorable member for Maranoa approaches close to the question of administration. It is true that in the Department men of special training and special knowledge are doing clerical work; and, in referring to this, the honorable member put his finger on a weak and dangerous spot. However, that state &#34;of affairs is being remedied as rapidly as possible. The honorable member for Parramatta asked me, in a general way, whether the defences are in a better condition now than before. </para>

              <para>-  Will the Minister allow me to quote Colonel McCay, whose words, perhaps, will place the matter more clearly before honorable members than I can do. Colonel McCay, when speaking on the 12th September, 1905, made a forecast of the requirements of the Defence Department for the purpose of completing a scheme then in process of evolution. He on that occasion said that an expenditure of &#163;800,000 would be necessary, and that if a loan was not. to be raised Parliament must decide how much should be spent each year. I believe that Colonel McCay recommended that short-dated loans should be raised for the purpose, but I am not sure as to that, and I may be doing him an injustice. At any rate, he sketched a proposal extending over a series of years, and involving in the aggregate an outlay of &#163;800,000 as special expenditure for the purpose of developing the scheme then afoot. I should like to know whether the money we are voting now is in pursuance of that scheme. Is that scheme to be continued, and, if not, why not? </para>

              <para>- The difference between previous proposals, which are under review on these present supplies, and the ideal which the Government has in view, is in regard to the purchase of articles which could not readily be obtained in Australia in time of war. The Government&#39;s policy is to purchase at the present time articles which cannot be obtained in time of war, 3608 <inline font-style="italic">Supply.</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Supply.</inline> and to allow the purchase of articles which can be obtained at such a time, to stand over, or, at least, to give preference in purchase to the former. For instance, every one agrees that the cavalry ought to have a uniform saddle, but saddles, at least resembling the kind required, could be obtained in time of war, whereas rifles could not; and, therefore, in our purchases rifles take precedence of saddles. There is an item for the provision of field artillery. </para>

              <para>- There is much urgently required to be done in the Department, and much that must be done; and I agree with the honorable member for Kooyong that we shall have to do infinitely more than in the past. The question has been asked, however, whether the Department is now in a better position than it was previously. In regard to artillery and rifles, the position is infinitely better, and the same may be said in regard to ammunition. We have heard much of the pre-historic days of Federation ; but I may tell honorable members that at that time in one of the States there were only seventeen rounds of ammunition per rifle. </para>

In reply to what has been said by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, I wish to make it clear that it is the policy of the Department to procure in Australia everything that can be locally manufactured, and it will take a great deal of proof to cause me to believe that requirements of almost any kind can not be supplied here. Further, with regard to general progress, we have now made provision for over  40,000  cadets, and  40,000  to  50,000  members of rifle clubs, who will be drilled under a scheme which will shortly be brought into operation. A question has been asked about maps. One of the first things I did &#39; upon coming into office was to inquire whether our maps are satisfactory. I learnt that they were not. </para>

            <para>. - I realize that it is almost impossible for any member of the Committee to have special knowledge of the details of departmental administration; we can judge the work of a Department only by what we see of its general effect. I wish to draw special attention to the need for providing for the defence of the northern part of Australia. At the present time a most insidious invasion of our country is taking place there. The northern part of Australia is within a comparatively short distance of India, which has a population of 300,000,000 ; of China, which has a population of 400,000,000 ; of Java, which has a population of 30,000,000 ; and of Japan, which has a population of over 50,000,000, and. therefore we should devote great attention to its defence needs. At Thursday . Island there is a pearling fleet which might be made the nucleus of an Australian Navy; but, unfortunately, the pearl-shell industry is now chiefly in the hands of Japanese, who have a more intimate knowledge of our northern coasts than any Australian possesses. But commercial interests must give way to national interests, and these demand that this industry should be entirely in the hands of Australians, so that young Australians may acquire the special knowledge of which I speak. Just as the fishing fleets of the northern parts of the United Kingdom have provided sailors for the British Navy, so our pearling fleets might, under proper legislation, be expected to furnish sailors for an Australian Navy. Interferences with commercial enterprise may be necessary, and as a young Australian who has visited that part of the Commonwealth, I wish to warn the Committee of its vulnerability, and to draw attention to the need for making special provision for its defence. </para>

            <para>. - The statement of the Minister of Defence was a very interesting one, but it brought to my mind the quotation, &#39; &#39; Chaos has come again.&#34; It appears that nothing; has been done by the Defence Department but to spend money. I do not hold him responsible for what has happened in the past, because he has only recently attained! office; but the constant changes in the administration of the Defence Department make continuity of policy impossible.  Colonel McCay  was an enthusiast in military matters, and when Minister of Defence tried to put into practice very elaborate ideas. I did not believe in his policy, because it would have run the country into enormous expense. But I recognise the ambition- which prompted him, although with him, as with most others, soldiering was only a side line. We had one first-class man at the head of the Department - Major-General Hutton - who told us truly that we could have a proper military system only by going <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> an enormous outlay. Had we adopted his policy we should probably have spent millions on defence by this time. Europe maintains armies numbering hundreds of thousands, and an enormous number of men devote their attention wholly to questions affecting accoutrement and equipment. As a matter of fact, Europe&#39;s militarism has brought some of the great powers almost to penury, and if we follow their example our. Defence expenditure will be enormous, although our defences may still be incomplete. So much attention is devoted by keen, scientific men <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the development of new ideas in regard to arms, and there is such keen competition amongst the military powers of the world, that what is up-to-date to-day will be out-of-date next year, and thus expenditure totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds is constantly being rendered useless by the improvement of weapons. No doubt if the present Minister remains in office for any length of time - which I think impossible - he will make many improvements. At one time he was an enthusiast on military matters, and wrote some very able papers on defence; but he seems to have lost some of his enthusiasm. Every defence scheme will be a failure unless the men who are called upon to carry it out are in agreement with it, and are willing to co-operate to make it a success. As to the defective ammunition which it has been alleged has been supplied to cadets, I would point out that makers who would supply defective ammunition to cadets would supply it to adult forces, and it will be a serious matter if our men are provided with worthless cartridges. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will look into the matter. </para>

              <para>- He got Parliament to vote a very large sum for saddles. The Minister who succeeded him reversed his policy, saying that this equipment was not needed. Six months later I remember the Prime Minister telling us that we had had three defence periods in five years- the G.O.C. period, the D.C. period, and he was not allowed to complete his classification, some one interjecting &#34;the period of muddle.&#34; It seems to me that the period of muddle is still continuing. On the admission of the Minister of Defence we have frittered away millions, and still have an imperfect system. Some one should be hanged for what has occurred. </para>

              <para>- No. In Great Britain, during the autumn manoeuvres, large bodies of troops are put under service conditions for a period of five or six weeks, and we have opportunities for such training in Australia which cannot be obtained elsewhere. Why should we not have similar manoeuvres in the Monaro country? The South Australian and Victorian troops could be marched there from Bairnsdale, the Tasmanian troops landed at Twofold Bay, and the New South Wales and Queensland troops brought down from the north. We have no information in regard to the various items in this subdivision, under which we are asked to vote  &#163;130,000.  We have been voting every year various sums for field artillery, and yet we are asked to-day to agree to an item of  &#163;29,000  in respect of - </para>

          <para>Why is this expenditure necessary? What has become of the money that we have already voted for similar purposes? Then, again, we find that  &#163;8,000  is provided for the purchase of camp equipment. Some two or three years ago, in Queensland, what was described as worn-out defence material was sold by public auction, and a few months later, a lot of camp equipment that had been disposed of in this way had to be re-purchased. Tents which had been sold at from  5s.  to  10s.  each were re-purchased at prices ranging as high as  &#163;3.  That discloses an extraordinary state of affairs. Will the Minister also afford the Committee some information in regard to the item of  &#163;1,000  for engineers&#39; equipment? I recognise that the item of  &#163;10,000  for the purchase of cadet rifles and spare parts is a reasonable one. If we are to encourage the cadet movement, such an expenditure cannot be avoided. But I would draw special attention to the item -  25,000 sword bayonets and scabbards for short M.L.E. rifles, ^18,750. </para>
          <para>In a recent issue of an English newspaper, I saw a paragraph to the effect that the War Office had not determined on the class of bayonet to be adopted for the British troops. It was stated that some severe tests were being carried out, but that the authorities had not yet decided whether they would adopt .the sword bayonet or the triangular-shaped bayonet.  Have the Government decided what class of bayonet is to be adopted for the use of the Defence Forces of the Commonwealth? I refuse to vote  &#163;18,750  for this item unless I have a satisfactory explanation in regard to it. There are several other items which need to be explained, and 1 hope that the Minister will place some information before the Committee in regard to them. </para>

              <para>- Colonel Le Mesurier held that office for about two and a half years, and Colonel Stanley for less than twelve months. Colonel Parnell is now Chief of Ordnance, but is not responsible for the state of affairs disclosed this afternoon, and I have some doubts as to the extent of the responsibility of Colonel Stanley. It will be remembered that earlier in the debate I asked the Minister what officer was responsible to him and to the House in the matter of equipment, and that he replied &#34; The Chief of Ordnance.&#34; We know, therefore, that notwithstanding the Board of Control, there is an officer whom we may hold responsible for these matters. For the last two or three years there have been neither waggons nor- limbers for field guns already in Australia. During that time a howitzer battery has been stowed away in Sydney, and no one knew anything of it until it was recently discovered by the Minister. I wish to know what action the Minister intends to take in regard to those responsible for the scandalous state of affairs which he has disclosed. As a matter of fact the Department has promoted Colonel Le Mesurier to the &#39; position of State Commandant. </para>

            <para>. - If the honorable member will pardon me, I should like to explain what actually occurred. I was asked who advised the Minister with regard to equipment, and I replied &#34; The Chief of Ordnance.&#34; The honorable member for Corio now holds that we should attach to that officer the responsibility for the state of affairs complained of. I have informed the Committee&#39; once or twice that I could not explain at this juncture who was absolutely to blame for the non-supply of limbers and waggons for guns already in Australia unless I went fully into detail. The position is this: The Chief of Ordnance may tell a Minister that he needs &#163;100,000 for the purchase of necessary equipment, and the Minister may say in reply to him, &#34; I dare not ask Parliament to vote so large a sum, and the Treasurer says he cannot find the money. Cut down the amount for which you ask by &#163;50,000.&#34; When that is done the officer has to do the best he can with the reduced vote. </para>

When a Minister asks for &#163;500,000 for his Department and the Cabinet say &#34; We are not prepared to ask Parliament to vote more than &#163;300,000,&#34; he may, if he pleases, retire and perhaps make way for a less competent person, or he may do the best possible with the means at his disposal. But I would appeal to honorable members in dealing with this matter to be guided by the ordinary rules which they adopt in every-day life, and to be sure that an officer is to blame before an indictment is laid against him. </para>

Are we to suppose that  Colonel Le  Mesurier, who, as a member of the Military Board, appointed himself Commandant of Western Australia, or  Colonel Stanley,  who, as a member of the same Board, promoted himself to the office of Commandant of Victoria, ordered field guns for Australia without limbers, wheels, or ammunition? I am very glad that the honorable member for Flinders has raised this question of responsibility. For ;years I have been vainly attempting to fix responsibility for the chaotic condition of our Defence Department upon the right shoulders. This afternoon a small searchlight has .been thrown &#39; upon the work of the Department, and the Minister has rendered the country some service by telling us what he has done. I have no doubt that he is endeavouring to do his best, but he is prevented from doing so By the tremendous dead weight of officialism and red tape with which he is surrounded. I admit all that has been said this afternoon of the ability displayed by  Colonel McCay  as an administrator of that Department. But, knowing as he did - and as every man . connected with the Military Forces knows - the rottenness of the Department, I blame him for lacking sufficient courage to sweep away a number of men whose utter inefficiency and lack of any sense of responsibility prevented good work from being accomplished. Had  Colonel McCay  done his duty, he would have cleared away a lot of the rubbish at the head of our Defence Forces at the present time. The Minister has had seven or eight months&#39; experience of his office, and ere this he must have found out the inefficiency of these men. He must have discovered that if Australia were threatened with invasion to-morrow our only hope of successful resistance  would rest with the junior or citizen officers. The Minister has said from time to time that in the junior officers lies the hope of the Department. Obviously it is his duty <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> get rid of these other officers. But instead of doing so, he promotes them to the positions of State Commandants. Some of these men have receive&#39;d large increases of salary, notwithstanding that they are responsible for the&#39; wretched state of our defence equipment. The Defence Forces need equipment, but I will take the responsibility - so as .to avoid the possibility of good equipment being spoilt by bad officers - of voting against the whole item. That is the only way in which we can bring the Minister up with a round turn. It is idle to provide funds for men who cannot spend them properly - men for whose inefficiency the Minister wishes to accept responsibility. There is not the slightest doubt that he is the most- generous Minister that we have had. He is too generous to be just. I wish that he would be more just to these officers and to the Commonwealth, and that he would act with a full sense of his responsibility. If he does not, I feel that we shall be overwhelmed by a catastrophe which I fear is only too imminent. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Colonel FOXTON.-</inline>The Department should be criticised. The Minister - not any particular officer - is responsible to this House, and I have always understood that it is the duty of a Minister to see that his Department is properly conducted. - If it is not so conducted, he alone is responsible to Parliament. As I have already said, I strongly deprecate personal attacks upon officers, and, as I happen to know something about one of these Items, I shall give the Committee the benefit of my knowledge. I venture to say that if a strict inquiry were made by the Minister, it would be found that the delay in the receipt of certain equipment in respect of our field artillery is due to the fact that the Government - like other Governments throughout the Empire - have been unable to procure from the Woolwich arsenal the equipment which they desire. </para>

To do that, we should require an arsenal like the one at Woolwich. To incur the expenditure necessary for us to establish such an arsenal would be a very doubtful experiment, because the local demand for ordnance is so limited that it would not justify an expenditure of perhaps  &#163;1,000,000. </para>

          <para>Colonel FOXTON.- Yes. I think that I called attention to this matter last session. Some time ago a question was asked of the Minister for War in the House of Commons as to the progress which was being made in the re-arming df the British Army with the modern eighteen-pounder guns, which are of a very complicated character. He replied that the delay which had occurred was due to the fact that the Colonies and India had been supplied with the mark  1  pattern of these guns, and that, as improvements would probably be introduced a little later it would be to the advantage of the mother country to wait. For precisely a similar reason, it will perhaps be to our advantage to wait a little longer. </para>

          <para>Colonel FOXTON. - Anybody who knows anything about ordnance knows that when a new type of gun is issued from Woolwich it is known as mark  1.  I have never known a case - and I have worked six different types of field guns - in which the mark II. gun was not very much superior to the mark  1  weapon, either on account of some details in its mechanism, or because of the ammunition with which it was supplied&#39;.. A considerable improvement is always made, both in the gun itself and in the ammunition, as the result of experience. I can quite understand that our Ordnance officer - whoever he may have been - may have been perfectly justified in the advice which he gave - that certain indents should be obtained from Woolwich, and that we have already to hand all that is available. </para>

I feel certain that the delay which has occurred is due to the fact that the Commonwealth Government have not been able to obtain from the Imperial authorities the whole of the material which they desired. That has been the case in connexion with every gun which has been brought out. It was so in the case of the  12-pounders  and of the  15-pounders,  and doubtless it is so in the case of the modem  18-pounders,  which are more complicated than any of the other weapons. </para>

              <para>- They often resign as soon as they get to the top of the tree. It is of no use our spending money on the training of officers if those officers are not to be  utilized in the service of the country ; and It is certain that with officers doing clerical work, we are not getting that faithful and true service we have a right to expect. The Minister is very good to take all the responsibility on his own shoulders, but of what good is that to the country ? We are sent to manage the country&#39;s affairs ; but I am sure that if the business of a public company were managed in the same way the directors would be ignominiously dismissed, and would richly deserve the punishment. I hope the Minister will take to heart what has been said in the course of the debate this afternoon. Since the present Minister has been in office, he has overcome many obstacles, and has tried to do his best, both for the service and for the country. I am sure that if the honorable gentleman Is allowed to retain office long enough, the Defence Forces will be placed in a better position than they have been since the inauguration of Federation. It has been admitted this afternoon that most of the money voted for the defences has been utterly wasted. It is shameful that this confession should have to be made at the end of six years of Federation. </para>

            <para>. - I am glad that the Treasurer has determined to postpone the consideration of this division. I urge that it should be postponed beyond Tuesday next, unless in the meantime there is a probability of the Prime Minister returning to the House and unfolding to us the new naval arrangements, which are to be made as a result of his visit to London. I do not desire to go into the question this afternoon, but, before we vote this huge sum, which in itself inaugurates a new scheme of some kind, we. ought to have a very full outline, not only of the efforts which are being made here in connexion with naval defences, but of our future relation to the fleet of the mother country. I am surprised to find this huge expenditure included in a list of minor public works of an urgent character. </para>

If the vote were passed to-morrow, not a penny would be spent during the next twelve months under the most&#39; favorable conditions. My simple suggestion is that this vote should await a full declaration of policy on the part of some responsible Minister. </para>

We are all anxious that these Estimates should be passed so that the necessary works may be proceeded with at once. Seeing that we have reached the end of September, the financial year is fast passing away. But as to the item I have mentioned, more information is required from the Prime Minister. </para>

            <para>. - This division has been circulated separately, having been brought down yesterday or the day before. The only item in the division is &#163;1,000 towards the construction of a building in the Strand, London, for Commonwealth offices. There is another item in the ordinary Estimates in connexion with a proposed site in the same&#39; thoroughfare for Commonwealth buildings, but that, it will be observed, is for rent only, whereas the present Estimates have to do with works. I desired to submit this proposal to honorable members as early as possible, because the time has nearly expired during which I have the option from the London &#39;County Council for the purchase of this site in the Strand.  I  did not care to undertake the responsibility of making any arrangement until I had consulted with honorable members. </para>

              <para>- I have not the slightest doubt of that. . The Canadian Government, or some large Canadian company, has rented an adjoining site. This; Government is not yet bound, but the period within which a definite answer must be given to -the London County Council has nearly expired, and I wish for the authority of Parliament to continue the negotiations. </para>

              <para>- The frontage available to us is about 200 feet, the land becoming more valuable as one approaches? the street corner. The lowest area that we require is 10,000 square feet. In the first year no rent will have to be paid ; in the second year, one-fourth of the rent fixed upon ; in. the third year, one-half ; in the fourth year,, three- fourths ; and in the fifth and subsequent years, the full amount. Therefore we shall not be paying the full rent while the buildings are being erected. I believe that the London County Council is anxious for us to take this site. </para>

            <para>- Much better. I looked at eight sites altogether, two of which were situated in Westminster. The Prime Minister went with me on one occasion, and he is as strongly in favour of this site as I am. The astuteness of the Premier of Victoria is well known, and he did not hesitate a moment about the matter. I think that we should erect a really fine building, which will be. an advertisement to the Commonwealth. </para>

In the meantime, he could circulate amongst honorable members a memorandum setting out the scheme. That would enable us on Tuesday to discuss the matter with every desire, on my part, as well as on the part of the majority of honorable members, that it shall be dealt with entirely on its merits, and with a view to making the best possible arrangement. I hope therefore, that the honorable member will not persist in asking the Committee to agree this afternoon to this item. </para>

            <para>. - I would suggest to the Acting Prime Minister that we should have a little more information as to the area which he thinks the Government should acquire, and also as to the amount of the ground rent to be paid. I presume that the honorable member wishes to be authorized to make arrangements for securing the site selected by him, and if we agree to this item now we shall really give the Government power to complete a lease of the land. It is not altogether desirable that- we should take that step until we have further information before us. It cannot be denied that the proposed site is an excellent one for offices or for advertising purposes; but I think that the Acting Prime Minister should indicate to what purpose the Commonwealth buildings, when established, are to be devoted. On more than 3618 <inline font-style="italic">Supply.</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Supply.</inline> one occasion, the opinion has been&#93; expressed in this House that we should undertake the inscription of our stock ourselves, following the example of South Australia. The Governments of Australia at the present time are paying between  &#163;30,000  and  &#163;40,000  per annum for the inscription and management of the public debts of Australia, which amount to over  &#163;240,000,000.  If the Commonwealth is to do that work, the office in which it is done would have to be near the Stock Exchange and the banking institutions in London. </para>

              <para>- I make no suggestion ; but if we take over the debts of the States, and inscribe our own stock, we shall need to have offices as close as possible to the Exchange and the Bank of England. If we are not to undertake that work, then the site undoubtedly is an excellent one for Commonwealth purposes. I do not know that it is as good as would be a site at Chairing Cross, but I am not, going to raise any objection to it on that score. The Acting Prime Minister has recently been in London, and he &#39;knows what is wanted, and has no doubt also been well advised. I am not sure that the practice of allowing the banks to inscribe our stocks is not, after all, the best. The Imperial Government find it to their advantage to have their work done by the Bank of England. We might save directly and lose indirectly if we carried out the work for&#39; ourselves. I suggest to the Acting Prime Minister that this item be postponed. I repeat that for advertising and general office purposes, the site chosen by the honorable member is an excellent one. It is close to the Law Courts, and in the heart of the traffic of the Strand and Kingsway, but it would not be a suitable place for an office at which to inscribe our stock. </para>

            <para>. - I hope that too much importance will not be attached to the objection raised by the right honorable member for Swan. I am sure that the difficulty in the way of inscribing our stock would not be so great as he predicts. I am heartily in favour of the Acting Prime Minister&#39;s scheme, believing that he proposes to take a step in the right direction. Having regard to the changes which have recently taken place in that part of London, I do not think that a better site could have been chosen, and I trust that it will become the centre of the commercial, financial, and general interests not only of the Commonwealth Government, but of the whole of the Australian S tates </para>

              <para>- I do not altogether agree with the position taken up by the right honorable member. If, before we select a site, we are to decide all the details to which he has referred, if we are to determine the whole policy with regard to the duties of the High Commissioner and the work to be carried out in the Commonwealth offices, we shall lose the opportunity of securing that proposed by the Acting Prime Minister. I am not so strongly impressed with the difficulties of the situation as is the right honorable member for Swan, but I would join with the deputy leader of the Opposition in urging the Acting Prime Minister not to press this item this evening. If we deal with the item early on Tuesday the Government should be satisfied, and probably there will be very little opposition to it . </para>

            <para>. - They have. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent</inline> has arranged for the corner portion of the site, but I cannot find out the exact price that he has paid for it. I was under the impression that the settlement of this question would not occupy many minutes, but it may be that I am more sanguine than are others, because I have seen the site. I have no hesitation in saying that it is by far the best site offered. However, I do not wish to be under the imputation of having endeavoured to rush the item through at the last moment today. I am aware that the representatives of South Australia and New South Wales desire to return to their homes this afternoon, and I have no wish to prevent them doing so. I hope that if I consent to the postponement of the item it will be agreed to upon Tuesday next without much debate. I can assure honorable members that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent,</inline> who has acquired a portion of the site, can obtain a very substantial profit on his bargain to-morrow. Consideration of this item will be the first business proceeded with on Tuesday next. </para>
