                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether his attention has been called to a cablegram which appears in this &#39;morning&#39;s newspapers, in reference to the compulsory disclosure to the public of the contents of patent medicines, and to the action which is being taken by those interested in the matter in England? I also wish to know whether it is the vested interests at work which are responsible for the reluctance of the Government to introduce the Bill dealing with this question, which has been promised for a long time past? </para>

                        <para>- I promised the honorable member that I would inquire into this matter this morning, if time permitted. I am sorry that I have been called upon to answer the question immediately, because I know that the Comptroller-General of Customs has written a memorandum, which I have not yet before me, setting forth the circumstances under which the differentiation in question was made. The rebate provision in the present Tariff was contained in the previous Tariff , and the separation of wool-scouring machinery from wool-scouring machinery to be used in woollen mills was the result of an error. An amendment has now been prepared, with a view to placing all this class of machinery upon the same footing. </para>

If such rules have not been prepared, what is the reason ? </para>

                        <para>- I would point out to the honorable member that the origination of all rules does not rest with the Department of the Attorney-General ; that is a matter in the hands of the Department which is charged with the administration of the particular Act. The Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act is administered by the Department of Trade and Customs. &#39; I think that,&#39; in connexion  with t&#39;he matter referred to, a Justice of the High Court issued certain directions as regards procedure,  and I know that these were circulated. </para>

That pans out at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;13</inline> per quarter for each employ^. In other words, the Sunshine&#34; average wage is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per week,  or 5d.  per hour. Oh, let us be joyful ! Now, when an Australian manufacturer has to pay his employes 5d. per hour how are we to protect him against the sweated products of Great Britain and the Continent, where men are glad to work for 6d. per hour? </para>

                        <para>- On behalf of my colleague, and the Government generally. I would point out that the honorable member has based his question upon a return in a form which probably makes the comparison presented illusory. That return seems to include the total number of employes of all ages engaged in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay&#39;s</inline> factory. It does not make any allowance for broken time, and we all know that the number of employes engaged in the industry varies greatly during the. year. Further, the statement forms part of a series of allegations which are now being  inquired into bv the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, with a view, first of all of determining the facts ; and, secondly, of fixing a fair and reasonable wage. </para>

                        <para>- The suggestion of the honorable member, if acted upon, would probably involve ari infringement of the Constitution. The Commonwealth has power to deal with industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State, but the honorable member wishes us to consider the propriety of inserting in the amending Conciliation and Arbitration Bill a provision which would have the effect of giving the right of appeal to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court from a State industrial tribunal upon a State matter. I do not desire to express constitutional opinions offhand, and if the honorable member will give notice of his question, I will look into it. At the same time, I think that it is not within the power of the Commonwealth to do as he suggests. </para>

                        <para>. - I think it would perhaps be better if we disposed of the first amendment to this item as soon as possible, instead of hanging it up while a discussion upon preferential trade is proceeding. The Government desire the question of preference to Great Britain to be discussed unhampered by any other consideration. I practically made that announcement the other evening. If the suggestion meets with the concurrence of the Committee, I should like the amendment of the honorable member for Lang to be dealt with before we proceed with the more elaborate discussion upon the question of preference. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer has suggested that the amendment should be disposed of before the whole question of preference is opened up. Of course, it has already been opened up by last night&#39;s discussion; but I should like to know what the intentions of the Government are after this item has been disposed of. Last night we quite expected that the Prime Minister, or, failing him, the Treasurer would make a statement regarding the attitude of the Government on the whole subject of preference to the mother country and to the rest of the Empire. We were&#39; told that materials were accumulating and shaping themselves, which would enable that to be done in a complete manner, but, so far,&#39; no statement has been made. I do not ask the honorable gentleman to make a speech on the question now, but simply to indicate to us what his intentions are after this item has been disposed of. Such an intimation would facilitate our dealing with the item. </para>

                            <para>- I do not desire to be delayed by interjections in dealing with this matter, or to have any heat displayed. There is the simple fact that we are a protectionist Government, and we desire to protect the manufacture of candles in Australia. If honorable members will&#39; follow me for a few minutes, I shall give very cogent reasons why this duty should be increased to2&#189;d. per lb. That was the duty proposed in the 1902 Tariff, but it was reduced to1d. </para>

In New South Wales, in 1901, there were manufactured, in round figures, between 3,000,000 lbs. and 4,000,000 lbs. of candles; in 1902, 3,000,000 lbs.; in 1903, a little over 3,000,000 lbs. ; in 1904, nearly 4,000,000 lbs. ; and in 1905, 4,000,000 lbs. odd. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that point later on. In Victoria, the manufacture in those years amounted, on the average, to about 5,000,000 lbs. I have no figures for Queensland or South Australia, but in Western Australia, in 1 901, there were manufactured, in round figures, 1,700,000lbs.; in 1902, 1,800,000 lbs. ; in 1903, 1,700,000 lbs. ; in 1904, 1,900,000 lbs.; and in 1905, 1,600,000 lbs. In Tasmania, in 1903, there were manufactured 925,000 lbs. </para>

                            <para>- My desire is that the tallow which is now exported should be converted into candles in Australia, so as to stop the manufacture from the injurious imported product. In Tasmania, in  j  904, there were manufactured 620,000 lbs. Now, let us see what the imports are. In 1901 there were imported into Australia from the United Kingdom, 140,878 lbs.; in 1902, 202,000 lbs. odd; in 1903, 207,000 lbs. odd; in 1904, 151,000 lbs. odd; in 1905, 219,000 lbs. odd ; and in 1906, 133,400 lbs. These candles were composed partly of stearine and partly of wax. </para>

The importations from&#39; other British Possessions were small, being in 1905 nearly 20,000 lbs., and in 1906 a little over 13,000 lbs. From Belgium in 1901 there were imported 1,382,351 lbs. ; in 1902, 4.22,742 lbs. ; in 1903, nearly 300,000 lbs.; in 1904, 1,403,792 lbs. ; in 1905, nearly 394,000 lbs. ; and in 1906, 734,377 lbs. From Germany in 1901, there were imported 948,000 lbs odd; in 1902, 360,000 lbs. odd; in 1903, 256,000 lbs.; in 1904, 337,000 lbs. odd ; in 1905, nearly 328,000 lbs.; and in 1906, over 117,000 lbs. </para>

Those imported from Burmah, India, and the United States, are nearly all made of wax; those coming from Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands, are made mostly of stearine; and the remaining imports are made partly of stearine and partly of wax. </para>

The importers have been paying 2jd. a lb. for it delivered ir. Australia, and the. cost of converting it into candles is only 25s. per ton, whereas the labour cost of converting tallow into stearine, is .&#163;10 per ton. </para>

                            <para>- I have not experienced anything of the kind. On a previous occasion I pointed out that the Dibbs Tariff had resulted in a reduction in the prices of candles. I then said that at the time of the imposition of that Tariff the price of candles in New South Wales had been raised to 7d. by the importing rings. About twelve months, or a little later, after the imposition of that duty, when the Sydney Soap and Candle Company at Newcastle had had an opportunity to extend its industry, it gave employment to between 400 and 500 hands, and the price of candles was brought down to about 4jd. I am speaking now of the best class of candles. Some honorable members said last night that I had had no experience of imported candles. I think I shall be able to satisfy honorable members that I have. Some time ago, when I resided at North Sydney, gas was not laid on to my house, and at night I used to burn at my bedside a candle fixed in a spring candle-stick. Honorable members are aware that when an inferior candle is used it runs and chokes the spring so that it will not work. In order to avoid that difficulty, I bought from Hordern&#39;s the best class of hard candle used by the miners, and later on I obtained a box of the Sydney Soap and Candle Company&#39;s best candles: I then found that there was no comparison between the imported candles which I obtained from Hordern&#39;s and the best candles made at the Newcastle works, the latter being very much better. That was my experience, and honorable members who are aware that miners find it necessary to use the hardest and best candles obtainable will recognise that I know what I am talking about. I find now that as a matter of fact p&#62;rior to the Dibbs Tariff the price of candles in New South Wales went up to 9d. and 9  Jd.  per lb., so that my estimate of 7&#39;d. was considerably below the mark. Later on they fell to 7d., and remained at that rate for some time after the imposition of the duty of id. per lb. When that duty was raised to  itd.  per lb. the price was reduced to 5fd. At the present time the duty is ad. and 2&#189;d., and the price of candles at the works is still 5 3/4d. This reduction in price was brought about by the opening of opposition factories, which were encouraged to commence operations by the Tariff, but the duties have not been sufficient to prevent the importation of large quantities of inferior wax candles. That is the history of candle-making in New South Wales since 1891 or 1892, and it covers the position in Victoria to-day. My statements can easily be verified, and I do not think the Opposition will have the temerity to assert that the effect of the Tariff has been to increase prices. On the contrary, it has prevented the importers from securing a monopoly of the trade, and local competition has brought down prices to a reasonable level. I repeat that the best class of miners&#39; candles which, prior to the imposition of a duty in New South Wales, were selling at 9d&#39;. and 9&#189;d. per lb. can now be obtained for 5 3/4d. &#34; These candles are made to a large extent from Australian tallow, and I am confident that the new duties will result in a reduction in the importations of wax and wax candles, and give rise to a corresponding increase in the use of Australian, tallow. I also feel confident that they will have the effect of further reducing the price of candles. There are certainly more than two firms engaged in the industry at present. Some manufacturers in a large way of business are afraid that the higher duties will encourage other men to enter into the industry, and that the increased competition will cause prices, to drop, and so reduce their profits. I am glad to be able to show that these duties will do no harm to the industry or to the consumer. Miners are now able to obtain good candles at a low rate, and are no longer compelled to use inferior candles injurious to health. </para>

                            <para>- That is the view which I take of the Minister&#39;s speech. He said that the figures which he read concerning importations would not suit the members of the Opposition, but, as a matter of fact, they show a decrease in importations. In 1899 3,452,599 lbs. of candles were imported ; in 1900 over 4,000,000 lbs. ; in1901, which was the year in which the first Commonwealth Tariff came into operation, over 3,800,000 lbs. ; in 1902 over 2,081,000 lbs. ; in 1903 over 3,000,000 lbs. ; and in 1906 only 1,857,355 lbs. Consequently the duty of1d. per lb. brought about a very large reduction in the importations, and, of course, there was a consequent increase in the local manufacture, which was being conducted chiefly in Melbourne, whence the howl came for higher protection for so-called &#34;strangled&#34; industries. The Tariff Commission found that the manufacture of stearine in Australia was to a large extent in the hands of Messrs. Kitchen and Sons, the well known Victorian makers. Indeed, Kitchen&#39;s own evidence shows that if the importation of paraffine wax is stopped, the small manufacturers of candles in Australia will have to close, because Messrs. Kitchen and Company have a monopoly of the stearine business. When the small factories close, they will increase the price of their candles by nearly the amount of the duty, and fleece the public proportionately. </para>

                        <para>A witness made a very succinct statement in&#34; writing in regard to the rates existing for standard makes just prior to Federation. For foreign stearine candles the prices charged to the trade in Victoria were1d., and in South Australia and Queensland 2d., per lb. above the price for the same brands in New South Wales, where there was no duty, the differences being exactly the amount of duly levied in the other States. It was stated that the prices of the local candles in each State were just under those of the imported brands. </para>

                        <para>A South Australian manufacturer in 1898, 1899, and 1900 supplied candles to Broken Hill, New South Wales, at lower prices than the prices at which imported candles were offered, and those lower contract prices were about1¾d. per lb. less than the same Adelaide-made candles were sold wholesale in South Australia. In the case of the mine contracts the tenderers were on the same basis as to transit charges. </para>

                    <para>I think that disposes of the contention of the Minister that duties do not raise prices. Prior to Federation it was found that manufacturers in protected States took full advantage of duties to raise their prices, and sold for less in New South Wales, where there was free-trade, than in the protected States in which their commodities were made. The Minister gave figures showing the importations for the present year but he was not clear whether the candles referred to were wholly stearine, or whether some were paraffine wax, and, if so, how many. He told us that importations for the first eight months of the present year amounted to 1,317,540 lbs., and spoke as if this importation were ruining the local candle- makers. As a matter of fact, the figures show, when compared with those for last year, when the importation was the lowest to date, that importation is still decreasing. The Treasurer appealed to the Committee to prevent the importation of candles from Burmah and India, which seems to me inconsistent with his preferential protestations. </para>

                            <para>- I should say that they ought to mean the British Empire. I should like to know what the Treasurer himself thinks. What is the position so far as importations from Burmah and India are concerned? One would imagine from the Treasurer&#39;s statements this morning that importations from these places are increasing. As a matter of fact they disclose a decided falling-off. Further, &#39; it is only during recent years that these candles have been imported. In 1905, the Commonwealth imported from Burmah 646,280 lbs. of candles and in 1906 only 69,718 lbs., so that there was. a decline of nearly 600,000lbs. 1111905 we imported from India 1,354,168 lbs. of candles and last year only 504,059 lbs. It will thus be seen that from these two places we imported 2,000,448 lbs. of candles in 1:905, and only 573,772 lbs. in 1906. There was thus a decline in our importations last year as against those of the previous year of 1,426,676 lbs. Belgium has also been referred to in connexion with the import of candles. It is perfectly true that there was an increase of 1,403,792 lbs. in our importations from Belgium last year as compared with 1905. But I would point out- that there was a decrease in the imports from Germany under this heading from 337,082 lbs. in 1904 to 327,595 lbs. in 1905, and&#34; to 117,027 lbs. in 1906. </para>

He has purchased all these places, and it has been conclusively shown that one up-to-date plant, costing only &#163;50,000, would be sufficient to supply the whole requirements of Australia in the matter of stearine.

Upon the evidence submitted to the Tariff Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen&#39;s</inline> business was a paying concern at one time, and returned no less than 10 per cent, in dividends. But the chief reason why he is not so successful at the present time is that he is feeling acutely the effect of Inter-State competition. &#39;That is a competition to which all manufacturers will have to submit. </para>

                        <para>But will not their inferiority be found out sooner or later? Will not it be found out that they are unsafe? - The .Rangoon candles are of much better quality, as regards the wax material, than the American wax candles, and that is the reason why they are&#39; taking the place of others. I am not so much afraid of the American paraffine taking away our best trade as I am that the&#34;&#39; Rangoon candles will do so, because the latter is much Better than the American article. 1 have already shown that the importation of these Rangoon candles has considerably fallen off. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen</inline> was then asked - </para>
                        <para>Where is the American paraffine made into candles - in most of the States or a particular State?- It is made up in Victoria. </para>
                        <para>By whom? - We have to use it to some extent. In Tasmania there are two or three moulders of wax in a small way of business, but the factories which are the principal moulders of this wax are in Sydney. There are no special factories in Victoria for moulding it, but every ion that we have to mould - and we have to use it to meet this competition - means less work for our machinery. It also reduces the use of tallow as well as the employment of labour. Block paraffine has merely to be moulded into candles, and involves only a nominal amount of work. </para>
                        <para>Is your firm the principal producer of. stearine in Australia? - We are the largest producers. </para>
                        <para>And the principal producers? - We are making more than any other company or firm in Australia. The Sydney Candle Company, I presume, comes next. Burfords, of South Australia, also do . 1 considerable amount of trade. </para>

                    <para>If the whole importation had gone on increasing by millions of lbs. every year, probably the stearine industry in Australia would have been jeopardized. But the fact is, that competition has been checked, that importations have declined, and that new factories have been established. </para>

I ask honorable members; to say whether, in the report of the protectionist section, they can see any justification whatever for the recommendation made. The evidence shows conclusively that the manufacture of stearine was being carried on profitably by several manufacturers at the time the report was drawn up ; and it is being successfully carried on to-day. </para>

                            <para>- I have already said that no stearine is imported, so that the duty appears to have been absolutely effective. There is no doubt that if the Australian manufacturers, used modern machinery, instead of old worn-out plant, the stearine industry would be much more successful than it is. The. Sydney Soap and  Candle Company were not successful for many years for the reason that, after spending tens of thousands of pounds on plant from Europe, they found it to be absolutely useless for the purposes for which it&#34; was intended. </para>

                    <para class="block">That was a low estimate, because even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen,</inline> of Victoria, admitted that the natural protection amounts to  25  per cent., which, with the old duty, meant a real protection, of  50  per cent. If an industry cannot be carried on with a duty of  25  per cent., the people of the country ought not to be called upon to put their hands in their pockets for the purpose of securing its continuance. We found that the labour cost in the manufacture of stearine ranged from  2  per cent. to  6  per cent. of the value of the finished product, according to the value or grade. There are various grades of stearine, according to the melting point, and as the fatty substances are removed, so the cost increases - the more stearine is refined the more does the manufacture cost. Taking the lowest quality, the cost of manufacture is about  2  per cent., and for the highest quality about  6  per cent. We also found- </para>

On paraffine wax there is already a duty of 25 per cent. ; and, surely, that is high enough to satisfy the most enthusiastic protectionist. In my own opinion the duty is much too high, for the reason that raw materials ought to be admitted at very low rates. </para>

                        <para>That the use of paraffine wax in the manufacture of candles has not been encouraged by the Commonwealth Tariff; that, in fact, the present Tariff, by imposing a duty upon it, has placed a charge upon manufacturers in those States where formerly for many years it was free, and where it was most used. In spite of such handicaps its use is now general throughout Australia;  it is not the importation from abroad which is affecting the manufacturer in Victoria and Tasmania, but the New South Wales product, principally that of Messrs. W. C. Upton and Company. We found - </para>
                        <para>That if any higher duty was imposed, it would have the effect of placing the majority of candle-makers at the mercy of the manufacturers of stearine, who are themselves  competitors for the trade in candles ; or of compelling the former to put down expensive plants for the manufacture of stearine, for which purpose the existing plants are more than sufficient for the whole requirements of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>It was shown clearly that even with the plant now possessed by Messrs. Kitchen and Sons, and with three shifts, that firm could make sufficient stearine to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth. If the manufacture were thus monopolized, it would leave the small manufacturers absolutely at the mercy of the big firm, because, of course, it would not pay the smaller men to lay down expensive plant. We also found - </para>

                        <para>That there is competition for the supply of paraffine wax  by  two rival organizations, and that, so far, the price charged has been fair and following the general market value. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I draw attention to this, because, in the report of the protectionist section of the. Commission, it is stated that the whole of the supply of paraffine wax is in the hands, of the Standard Oil Company. That, however, is not so, because there are two organizations - the Standard Oil Company and the company that imports paraffine wax from Burmah - which are working desperately against each other for the Australian trade. The whole of the .evidence shows that, apart altogether from any question of duty, the users of paraffine wax are now called upon to pay only a fair and reasonable price. We also found that the manufacture of candles within the Commonwealth has on the whole considerably increased, more especially in the States of New South Wales and Victoria. The figures quoted to-day by the Treasurer support that finding. Large quantities of candles manufactured in New South Wales and Victoria are sent to other States. A Tasmanian manufacturer explained to the Commission that he was suffering seriously from the dumping of Victorian candles in the Tasmanian market at a price below that at which they were sold in Victoria. After pointing out that the production in New South Wales and Victoria is in excess of the consumption therein, we proceeded to show that - </para>

                        <para>That the total labour cost in the finishing, moulding, and packing of candles for market, exclusive of the cost of making  stearine,  amounts to not more than 8 per cent, of the value of the finished product. </para>
                        <para>That the complete labour cost in the manufacture of candles from the preparation of the tallow until the goods are ready for sale does not exceed 16 per cent, of the market value of the product. </para>
                        <para>That the existing import duty of. id. per lb. is equal to nearly 25 per cent, of the average shipping cost of continental or British stearine candles, or about 16 per cent, on their normal selling price in Australia. On the shipping cost of paraffine wax candles the proportions would probably be slightly less. </para>
                        <para>That in addition to the direct protection there is a considerable natural protection in the inward freight and other charges borne by foreign candles, and also in the circumstance that Australian manufacturers are able as a rule to- obtain their raw material at a lower cost than their competitors oversea. </para>
                        <para>That the importation of&#39; candles of oversea manufacture into the Commonwealth has not appreciably increased under the operation of the Commonwealth Tariff; in fact, they now appear to be falling off. At the most they do not supply more than one-sixth of the whole consumption.&#34; 1 do not desire to weary honorable members by referring at length to the evidence given before the Commission. I am hopeful that they have read the conflicting reports of the two sections of the Commission on this important question, and that, having done so, they have arrived at the conclusion that none of the evidence submitted to the Commission affords any justification for the increased duties recommended by the protectionist section of the Commission, to say nothing of the increases proposed  by the Government. Instead of there being a falling off in the local manufacture of candles under the Commonwealth Tariff, there has been a very substantial increase.  Factories  which formerly had a comparatively small output are now producing large  quanti-  ties, and all the circumstances tend to show that in the interests, not only of the consumers, but of the small manufacturers, for whom the Treasurer professes to have great regard, these duties should be materially reduced. \ </para>

                        <para>.- This item affords opportunity for the consideration of the. general question of preference to Great Britain, and I propose to state plainly the attitude which I think we ought to assume. I have never been able to. understand how a logical protectionist could favour preference, nor, on the other hand, that preference flows naturally from free-trade. It is obvious, however, that the greater the area oyer which free-trade operates - where a nation as against other nations has .a protectionist Tariff, but enjoys&#34; free-trade within its own boundaries, the greater are the advantages. Take, for instance, the position of the United&#39; States. That is a highly protected country which attributes its prosperity to protection. It has at the same time a free-trade policy applying to 80,000,000 people. It is impossible to separate from the potentialities and possible advantages which flow from its policy of protection against the outside world the material advantages that flow from freetrade among its population of 80,000,000. I take it that the idea of the  preferentialist  is to have free-trade within the Empire and protection against the rest of the world. Subject to those peculiar local reservations which our part of the Empire require. 1 take it that we could so extend the area inside which we had free-trade as to make it practically independent of outside nations. </para>

He had in view the. object of extending and promoting the Imperial idea bv trading and industrial methods. During the course of his campaign, however, a number of problems presented themselves, and as a practical man he met them one by one. I think.  that had he gone on he certainly would have ended his campaign by becoming a protectionist. </para>

                            <para>- I think it was. Prior to his Glasgow speech he had in mind a condition of things which was utterly impossible in practice.  His  idea was that each part of the Empire should pledge itself not to encourage new industries or the expansion of those already existing within its boundaries. That would be an impossible policy for a progressive country. No progressive community could pledge, itself to refrain from starting any new industry. I cannot conceive of a system under which a Government would have power to prevent the expansion of industries, or, if it had, would attempt to exercise it. But, failing that, there were certain possibilities for preferential treatment which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> had in mind, and he so presented the advantages of these as to undoubtedly cause in Great Britain a complete change of feeling. He has created a party choate and articulate in favour of tariff reform of some kind or other. That party, no matter what its real purport may be, certainly does exist, and is going at the next election to make a very respectable show. Here is our position. Preference postulates, from a business stand-point, a mutual understanding. It ought to be a business arrangement. As a matter of fact, however, the present feeling in favour of preference has sprung not from a business but from an Imperial basis - from an idea of promoting the solidarity of the Empire. That being so, we are perfectly free to make what Tariff we like, and to grant Great Britain, irrespective of what she may do for us, what preference we please. If we grant a preference, I take it that we should do so because we are really desirous of favouring Great Britain. We ought </para>

                        be, because most of us are descendants of Britishers, Or actual natives of Great Britain, and because, also, she is our greatest customer. I had thought that the Government would come down with a definite and harmonious scheme. I do not think that it . can be said that&#39; they have done so. If the Committee, without any fixed and definite basis to work upon, is to decide on each item what preference shall be granted, we shall find ourselves in difficulties. Unless we have at our command some data, which I am very much afraid we cannot possibly hope to get, as to the exact position which Great Britain now occupies, and the effect on her of any proposed preferential treatment on every item, the result of our efforts will be a hotch-potch which will probably be unsatisfactory to her and to ourselves. Two main points demand our attention in this connexion. We must consider the effect of any Tariff on Australian industries and on the Commonwealth revenue. The Government, in proposing a duty of,  9ay, aid.  as a general rate, and 2d., 1 1/3d., or id., as a rate against the United Kingdom, giving in one instance a preference of 5 per cent., in another of 10 per cent., and going, it maybe, as high as 50 per cent., is not proceeding on any scientific or logical principle. There are to be found data and sound principles upon which we can devise a preference scheme which will be logical, scientific and practical. But in leaving to the Committee the task of dealing with each item as it thinks fit, the Government is failing in an essential duty. When the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were in England a great deal was said about preference, and the Imperial ideal was put very prominently forward. The picture which they painted lacked nothing in colour, being very fine and effective. . Then they gave us the poetry, but now we are having the prose, and the tale seems very poor and uninviting. It is due to the Committee that the Government should indicate not only its attitude in regard to every item, but the general principle upon which its preferential policy is  Eased.  If the Government proposes a preference of 5 per cent, on a certain item, and makes a preference, perhaps, of .40 per cent., its action may be grossly unfair to local manufacturers. The aim of the Government is&#39; to stimulate native industries, and it would not be fair to our manufacturers to protect them against the foreigners, but allow a preference to the United Kingdom which would expose them to the most powerful competitors in the. commercial and manufacturing world. The Government should state definitely the relation which they desire should exist between the general Tariff and that for the United Kingdom, and if one set of duties is altered by from 30 to 25 per cent., the other must be altered proportionately. There seems to be no constant relation between the two- sets of duties, except that the general Tariff rates in many cases are higher than those against the United Kingdom, and give, generally speaking, a preference of 5 per cent. to English manufacturers. In regard to the duties on candles, I do not feel in a position to determine what preference should be given, the items of the Tariff having been put before us in a slip-shod and unsatisfactory way. It does not seem to me that a case has been made out for increasing the duties on candles. Apparently, the miners object to the Rangoon candles, and if these candles are harmful, their importation should be prohibited. This Government has passed into law a number of Acts - such as the Australian Industries Preservation Act, the Excise Tariff Agricultural Machinery Act, and the Commerce Act - for the protection of Australian trade and Australian commerce, but it has never taken steps to enforce their provisions. If the fumes of Rangoon candles are poisonous or hurtful to the eyes, the provisions of the Commerce Act should be used to prohibit their importation.

                            <para>- Quite so. The Tariff ought not to be used to do what can be done under an Act like the Commerce Act. I am willing to impose such duties as may be necessary to encourage the local manufacture of candles ; but it seems to me that the rate in the old Tariff was sufficient, because under it the local manufacture has largely increased. Under the circumstances, unless the Ministry makes out a better case, I shall have to vote against its proposals. I regret that Ministers have not given us a well-defined scheme of preference. Personally, I am prepared to give Great Britain a decided preference. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that so little attention was paid to the valuable information given to the Committee by the speech of the honorable and learned member for Illawarra, who has devoted a great deal of intelligence, ability, and care to these matters. At one time, while he was speaking, of seventeen members in the chamber, twelve or thirteen were absorbed in private conversations. I have not had the good fortune to listen to a speech on a. subject of this kind more concise, clearer, or worthier of attention. I am afraid the fact is that it is enough for a speech to come from a free-trader to make it of no importance to the Committee. There seems to be a set disposition not to listen to anything uttered by any one who is not a protectionist. I make this remark advisedly, because the attitude of honorable members is most apparent. </para>

                            <para>- I have very little cause to complain personally, I am happy to say ; but it has struck me very forcibly, on this and other occasions, that there is an utter lack of interest and attention shown when valuable information is being given to the Committee by free-traders. I have only a few words to say upon the item itself, because it has been pretty well debated. The Government proposes to put a duty of 1&#189;d. per lb. on candles n.e.i., and of  2&#189;d.  per lb. on candles made wholly or in part of paraffine wax. I understand, however, that it is a usual thing, even with. Australian makers, to use, perhaps, not more than  5  per cent. of paraffine wax to stiffen their candles, and to improve their quality. But the use of only a small proportion of paraffine wax would make imported candles liable to the higher duty. I do not think that that is intended. I am sure that the Government do not wish to deprive the users of candles of the benefits which result from using a small quantity of paraffine wax in their manufacture. Of course it will be the duty of the Customs authorities to suppress any attempt to evade the intentions of Parliament ; but the use of, say,  5  per cent. of paraffine wax, which improves the manufacture of candles, should not be considered an evasion. I understand that the present arrangement of duties will prejudice two candle factories in Tasmania. No State in the Union has suffered more from Federation, in one sense, though it has derived great benefits in another. Having but a small population, its manufacturers suffer severely from the competition of those in a larger way of business on the mainland ; but it would be a great pity if small factories there were crushed out of existence by the readjustment of duties. The honorable member for Bass made a suggestion which seemed to indicate the danger of that. </para>

                            <para>- If such an expression can be used amongst brother Australians. Last evening the honorable member for Batman made some most reckless statements concerning the disastrous result which would follow the removal of the duty upon candles. I am indebted to one of my honorable friends for having drawn my attention to the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke,</inline> to whom the honorable member for Batman referred. From the report of the proceedings of that body it is abundantly manifest that Mr.&#39; Clarke was &#34; fencing &#34; with the members of the Commission throughout his examination. He made one admission, however, which tells against the position taken up by the honorable member for Batman. He told the Commission that during the year 1899, when there was absolute free-trade so far as candles were concerned, he produced a larger quantity than he did in 1 903. </para>

                            <para>- He is the gentleman to whom the honorable member for Batman referred, and he is a staunch protectionist, inasmuch as he conducts a factory. I hope that honorable members generally will not think that I entertain any ill-feeling towards manufacturers. But I have to consider the interests of other people as well. Some persons seem to think that our primary industries are of no importance, and that industries which have to be &#34; coddled &#34; are of the very gravest importance. I can only excuse that deranged view by recollecting that in all families it is well known that healthy children do not receive half the attention which is bestowed upon weaklings. The protectionist doctrine involves an evolution of a similar kind. I do ask honorable members to remember that while none of us wish to discourage Australian industry, we should pay some regard to every form of Australian industry. These gifts must come from some pocket, and  1  do not want to see too much taken out of the pocket of the pioneers and the settlers of Australia in order to give undue assistance to any particular manufacturer. The honorable member for Batman made an appeal which, fortunately, fell upon deaf ears, that we should indorse the Government proposal to prevent our manufacturers from being brought into competition with the cheap labour of India, where men worked in the industry for 4d. a day of twelve hours. Now, it is a fact that in India a very large number of white men are employed in this industry, and that they. receive double the wages there that they would obtain in Australia on account of the climate in which they are compelled to live. Nobody, I am sure, wishes to push his argument too far, because these 300,000,000 coloured people surely have some right to live, and the clay may come when they will assert that right. </para>

                            <para>- I did not mean the remark in the way that the honorable member has taken it. The fact is that a person has merely to make a mistaken statement in this chamber, and some honorable members at once seize upon it as if it were Gospel truth. It would be impossible to obtain an inferior candle in a climate like that of India. It is the worst country in the world in which to manufacture inferior candles, because, unless they are properly&#34; made they will not stand the climate. But a chance ejaculation has merely to be made in this chamber, and it is immediately accepted by some honorable members as representing the whole truth, so long as it will buttress up some extreme proposition. Even the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission does not recommend a duty of more than 2d. a lb. on candles. Under the old rate of duty we had secured five-sixths of the trade - </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member.  I think that the members of the party to which he belongs are upon a good wicket when they raise the colour question. But, whilst, in framing a policy for our own people, we have nothing to do with the teeming millions of India, we need entertain towards them no bad feeling whatever. They happen to be in the plan of creation. What I wish to point out is that, whilst the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission has recommended an increase in the old rate of duty of 100 per cent. , the .Government are proposing an increase in that rate of 150 per cent., notwithstanding that we already possess five-sixths of the trade in candles. </para>

                        <para>. - So far as I am able to form an &#39;opinion from reading the report of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference, the view entertained bv the leading British statesmen is that it behoves Australia to do all that she &#34; can to develop her resources and tq make herself a more efficient integral part of the British Empire. By so acting, it is generally held that she will be rendering the best possible service to the Empire. So  far as the question of preferential trade is concerned, the people of Great Britain would be satisfied if a preference were extended to goods of British origin that we are obliged to import. There are certain commodities that we must import, such as arms, jewellery, and watches. Let us make the Tariff prohibitive against the outside world, and give the mother country a preference upon those articles which we cannot produce. But, so far as we can develop our resources, and make ourselves a better unit in the community of nations, let us do it. In reference to the proposed duty upon candles, I would point out that the chief difficulty under which we labour is that we are being inundated by the importation of Rangoon candles. According to the report of the Tariff Commission, we are importing an enormous quantity of these candles, lt seems to me that,- in view of the fact that the Rangoon candles are not appreciated by those who use them, we should endeavour to conserve our own interests rather than those of the manufacturers of India. Apparently, the honorable member for East Sydney worships the god of cheapness in this matter. I could quite understand that attitude if we were in a position to absorb all our energies in the development of our natural products - if we had free access to natural opportunities. Then those things which can be produced here by least an effort on the part of our people might be exported to our advantage. But, as a matter of fact, we know that the natural resources of this country are monopolized, and consequently we are forced into other avenues of industry. We cannot secure the settlement of the people upon the land, and thus stimulate that development of the primary industries which would place us in the position of being able to exchange our commodities with the outside world in the best possible market. </para>

                            <para>- I am ready to hurt any Government which will not follow the lines that I think they ought to follow. I favour the proposed duty upon candles, because I think that local competition will be sufficient to adjust prices. If we are left to the mercy of the world&#39;s competition, we cannot protect the consumer, because we do not benefit from the cheapness of outside markets. I am rather disappointed at the action of the Committee in connexion with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. They ought to adopt the course which is provided when an industry takes advantage of its position to impose on the people; that is, admit competition. I should prefer nationalization, as I said before, but, seeing that we have no power to take that step, we must adopt the only means at our command. If, by protecting candles, we establish a monopoly, I should be the first to threaten; to take steps to prevent any injustice. But we cannot afford to leave the industries of the country languishing. Our natural conditions are not such as to insure equality, and our industries must be cultivated and encouraged, and, to that end, there must be protective duties with the corrective influence I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>.- I feel that I ought to say a few words, associated, as I am, with some of the larger mining enterprises &#39;in the Commonwealth. It may be that what I regard as my own private interest and my public duty are in conflict ; but I am certain that every honorable member will subordinate his personal concerns to his obligation as a representative of the people. My public obligation is simply to secure a duty sufficient to enable local manufacturers to compete successfully with importers. There can be no doubt that up to the present time the local manufacturers have not been successful in this connexion, as could be seen from a whole series of contracts with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. Without divulging any private affairs, the figures show that the importers have always been able to sell their products at a price which is more to the advantage of the &#39;mining companies than is the price of the local producer. If this duty be increased to 2&#167;d., the Broken Hill mining companies will have to pay ^3,818 more per annum for candles than they are paying at present. It is a fact, however, that most of the companies at Broken Hill are installing electricity underground, and candles are becoming less and less used. While I cannot support the amendment now proposed, I certainly am not prepared to support the Government proposal; and, therefore, I trust that the recommendation of the <inline font-style="italic">&#34;A&#34;</inline> division of the Tariff Commission will be adopted. As honorable members are aware, candles are now being made in Australia from imported Rangoon wax, and some statements have been made in the course of the discussion as to the injurious effects of this wax. On this point, T should like to read a letter obtained, in accordance with my desire, from the General Manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, in order that honorable members may see that this company has endeavoured to ascertain the real facts. The letter, which is dated 27th September last, is as follows - </para>

                        <para>In further reference to the alleged injury to miners due to the use of Rangoon wax candles - an experiment was made in the laboratory in  which inverted glass funnels about 6 inches in diameter at the mouth (the widest place) were placed about 6 inches over two candles of Rangoon wax and stearine candles respectively. </para>
                        <para>The result was a complete darkening of the glass wilh soot in the case of the Rangoon wax candle, while no deposit whatever was observable on the funnel over the stearine candle. This soot consists of unconsumed carbon, but the amount given  off  in this way must of necessity be trifling compared with the amount of carbon which finds its way into the throat and lungs of men handling coal. </para>
                        <para>The amount of soot given off bv these candles is not nearly so great as that given off by oil lamps used so extensively in various mines. </para>
                        <para>However, a medical authority .would be the best judge as to the effects of &#34;the small quantity of fine carbon that would be given off in the burning of two candles (which is the number actually burning with each party) - bearing in mind that the air in the workings of mines is always in- circulation carrying off such emanations. In this connexion, as illustrating the amount of air circulated in the Proprietary Mine which may be useful in connexion with debates in Parliament, I may say that the quantity of air per minute is about 250 cubic feet per man underground, whilst in coal . mines it is considered that 100 cubic feet per minute ner man is ample. </para>

                            <para>- I think that there is a tendency to exaggerate the injurious effects of these candles. I believe that it is better to use al stearine candle than a paraffine wax candle; but. at the same time, I do not think the Committee ought to allow themselves to be unduly influenced in this matter, in view of the letter which I have just read. No doubt the duty I have suggested will . mean an additional impost on the mining industry throughout the Commonwealth; but candle making is a natural industry, which I must support, in view of the pledges which I gave to my electors. I feel it to be my duty to see that such assistance is given to the industry as will enable those engaged in it to compete successfully with importers for the large mining contracts. The information I have in regard to contracts is here in documentary form, and, though I do not desire it to be made public by means of </para>

                            <para>- No doubt much is attached to the suggestion that the paraffine wax candle is the harder, and that when it is used the miner is not so irritated by its constant dripping. That, however, is a matter on which there is considerable conflict of opinion in actual experience; and I do not think the Committee would be justified in attaching too much importance to the point. It is a fact, however, that the paraffine wax candle takes a little longer than the stearine candle to burn, candle for candle. </para>

                        <para>. - I have only a few observations to offer. We are asked in connexion with this item to impose a duty which I think is shockingly high, which is unnecessary for the maintenance and expansion of the industry, and which will be a heavy impost upon the people. This tax falls with peculiar force upon, people in the far interior, and we ought to hesitate to agree to it unless there is proof that it is needed to preserve an Australian . industry. We heard this morning from the honorable member for Kooyong, who has a wide experience of contracts for candles, timber, and other miners&#39; requisites, that the contracts in connexion with some large mining ventures in which he is interested had always resulted unfavorably to the local tenderer. The honorable member was not prepared to say that certain considerations, apart from the mere matter of price, did not enter into the choice. It is well known that in the choosing of candles there is amongst miners as wide a divergence of opinion as there is among them in regard to the choosing of tobacco, cigars, and like commodities. Some people have a fancy for one brand, and some have a particular fancy for another. There is no accounting for these tastes. The fact remains that, for reasons diverse and multiplex, some prefer a particular candle for a particular purpose, while others prefer another brand. I am not going to discuss that question to-day, but I wish to call attention to a matter relating to our candle manufacture which requires some explanation. We are already exporters as well as importers of candles. We are able to export as well as to import candles in fair quantities ; we have about struck the balance respecting a fair competitive basis  as  between our own candle- producers and those outside. I have been hearing again and again since the opening of the Tariff debate, statements made, in some cases with lugubrious countenance and in menacing tones, that we are importing small  Quantities  of this, that, and the other article. Except as to the manufacture of a few products in respect of which Australia, by reason of its great natural advantages, is entitled to secure a monopoly, I hope never to see the day when imports will cease, because when competition ends combination and monopoly begin. That is the experience of the whole world. A protectionist who wishes an industry to have a healthy inter-play and exercise must always desire to see the competitive element kept constantly in force. Only in that way can we secure the best results for the country, and hope to maintain that healthy, vigorous productive capacity which is the mainstay and basis of the prosperity of a nation. </para>

                            <para>- We export from Australia 212,000 lbs. of candles. Strange to say, out of that total only 10,000 lbs. are of Australian manufacture ; the balance is a re-export. In other words, out of a total export of 212,000 lbs., only 10,000 lbs. represent Australian candles, 202,000 lbs. being candles made elsewhere. What is the explanation? Is it that people outside will not have Australian-made candles ? These candles are exported to New &#39;Zealand. Fiji, and New Caledonia, and it seems that those countries demand to be put in possession, not of Australian-made candles, but of those made oversea. Our exporters have, first of all, to import these candles, and then re-export them to supply the trade of these countries. In the absence of some explanation, that fact has a very sinister complexion. It may be due to a mere matter of taste or a matter of prejudice. </para>

                            <para>- I dare say we could do very well what the United States is able to do if we had a population of 80,000.000. The present price of candles in Australia is sufficiently high for our purpose. I think our manufacturers, with a duty of1d. per lb., have been doing very good business, and I am not prepared to increase that rate. By leaving the duty as it was under the old Tariff, we shall do all that is requisite to preserve whatever balance  may be necessary between the importation of candles from oversea and our manufactures here. Above all things, in connexion with our young enterprises in Australia, we must try to preserve a healthy, fair, and reasonable competitive basis on which our commercial and industrial undertakings may safely proceed. </para>

                            <para>- In deciding what should be the rates of duty on candles, we have a most intricate question to consider. At the present time five-sixths of the candles used in Australia are made within the Commonwealth, so that the local manufacturers practically control the borne market. I was interested in this business at one time, my father, with other gentlemen, having started, in 1876, the Apollo Candle Company, which, after some years, was amalgamated with the business of Messrs. Kitchen and Company. It is quite correct, as has been stated, that before there was a local manufacturer of candles the price of these articles was higher than it became on the imposition of the duty, and the consequent creation of local competition. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Of course we charged as much as the business would allow. Every manufacturer has to do that. If he did not he would go to the wall. As I have pointed out, the local manufacturers have control of this market, and are producing at a profit, though I do not think that they are getting a sufficient profit. If their balance-sheets are examined it will be found that the margin of profit is not very large - not large enough to enable them to extend their operations and to keep their machinery up-to-date. The last balance-sheet I looked at showed that the dividends paid to the shareholders are next to nothing, and ever since the industry started in 1876 the profits have been very low. The manufacturers have got the best machinery they can afford, but they have not had sufficient money to buy the best machinery available. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Illawarra objected that the machinery of the Sydney Soap and Candle Company was antiquated, and the cost of their operations therefore high. But while I should like to see the duties on candles slightly increased, because the large amount of capital invested in the industry is not earning a fair profit, I do not desire that the duties shall be made so high that prices will be materially raised. We are not now dealing with a new industry. and therefore any considerable increase in the rates of duty will lead to a corresponding increase in prices, and will penalize industries, such as the mining industry, which use candles very largely. I would give less protection to the candle-making industry than to the woollen industry, because the local manufacturers of woollens have not yet got possession of the Australian market, and to do so they must bring about a reduction of prices. The Minister should, therefore, consider the matter from this point of view. In my opinion, he might reasonably accept the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission to impose a duty of 2d. per lb. on paraffine wax candles, and of1d. per lb. upon candles n.e.i., which, I understand, are made chiefly of stearine. The importations of paraffine wax are increasing  largely, though I believe that this commodity is not used entirely in the manufacture of candles. </para>

                            <para>- If all that is imported were used in the making of candles, the increase in the importation would be alarming. Over  6,000,000  lbs. are now imported ; but as the local Australian consumption of candles is  20,000,000  lbs., at the very least  14,000,000  lbs. must be made from stearine. It is the making of stearine candles that we ought to encourage most. I believe that there are factories in Tasmania which use only imported paraffine wax for the making of candles, but such candles are not of high quality. </para>

                            <para>- When candles are made of stearine, local tallow is used for the manufacture of the stearine, whereas paraffine wax candles are made from an imported commodity which is manufactured abroad very cheaply. Therefore, the &#39;making of the stearine candles is the more important industry. But we wish to study the interests of Tasmania, and to encourage her industries as well as those of the mainland. The recommendation- of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission is that the duty on paraffine wax candles shall be raised  100  per cent., and that on stearine candles left at id. per lb. As a compromise, I suggest duties of  2fd.  and i}d. in the general Tariff, and of  2d.  and id. against British importations. </para>

                        (Kalgoorlie)  &#91;2.45J.-  I represent a constituency -which probably uses as man v candles as does any other constituency in Australia. Had we been able to arrive at a decision upon this item without a prolonged debate, I should have been quite prepared to give a silent vote upon it. But as every honorable member seems bound to express his opinion- upon the Government proposal, 1 feel impelled to express my view. I cannot agree with the line of reasoning that has been adopted by the Government in respect of this item. Of course, I desire to accord protection to industries which can, reasonably be established within the Commonwealth, and I shall, endeavour to do what is right in allocating the measure of protection to be extended to each. But I would point out that more than five-sixths of the candles consumed in Australia are of local origin. &#39;Only about  14  per cent, of the total consumption of the Commonwealth, is imported, and even that  14  per cent, or less includes night lights, tapers, &#38;c. In order to secure the additional  14  per cent, of trade, the Government propose to increase the old rate of duty by  150  per cent. From the rapid decline which has taken place during the last few years in the importation of candles, it is evident that within a year or two we shall obtain the entire trade, even if we do not alter the qld rate of duty. I am not opposed to increasing the impost upon candles by Jd. per lb. against the foreigner, but I think that the old rate should .be retained as against Great Britain.

                        <para>.- I am quite sure that I voice the general feeling of the Committee when I say it is a matter of very great regret that owing to ill health the honorable member for Bendigo is not present to give us the advantage of his valuable assistance in the elucidation of Tariff matters. I have been looking up the speech which he delivered upon the Budget and the Tariff proposals of the Government, and I find that he declared his willingness to afford substantial protection to Australian industries. In making that statement he undoubtedly expressed the opinion of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, which recommended that the duty upon candles should be increased from id. per lb. to  2d.  per lb. In the course of his remarks  the honorable member for Bendigo stated that the Commission had examined no less than  618  witnesses, and had investigated  767  complaints in regard to Tariff anom.alies. As a result, its members arrived at a deliberate determination based upon evidence. At an earlier stage in the debate, the Treasurer, in reply to a question &#39;as to why the Government propose a further increase in the duty upon candles, declared that the rate recommended by the protectionist section of the Commission was not sufficiently high. It is somewhat significant that he has failed to produce any evidence in support of that assertion. I am prepared to go a long way in support of the proposals of the Ministry, but they cannot expect me to give my adherence to unreasonable increases in the rates of duty imposed under the old Tariff, in the face of the recommendations of the Tariff Commission,, which examined witnesses upon oath. In the course of his remarks the honorable member for Bendigo said - </para>

                        <para>In reference to candles we found that the manufacture of candles from stearine, which is the product of tallow, had been established in various States such as Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia. But of late years the stearine candle-making industry has had to encounter a very formidable rival in the shape of candles made from paraffine wax, which is a by-product of petroleum. These candles are brought from America; and also from Rangoon. The candle-makers of the States to which I have referred complained of the undue competition of these paraffine wax candles. We felt that their case had been sustained, and accordingly recommended an increase in the duty upon paraffine wax candles of rd. per lb. At the same time we recognised that there were candle-makers in Tasmania and New South Wales who were making composite candles - that is, candles composed partly of stearine and  partly  of paraffine wax - and we declined to accede to the request to increase the duty upon paraffine wax, as the raw material. </para>

                    <para>That is a position which can be logically sustained. The protectionist section of the Commission have made certain recommendations which, as the honorable member for Bendigo remarked, represent the &#34; high- water mark of protection&#34; against the world. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I hope that the - honorable member for Gippsland will take note of the fact that what I stated upon that occasion was absolutely correct. I am prepared to support the recommendation of the protectionist section. of the Tariff Commission, and if the Government think it desirable to extend a preference to Great Britain, I am ready to grant it by reducing the duty levied under the general Tariff, but not by way of increasing the old rate. </para>

                        <para>.- I fail to see the need for such a high duty upon candles as 2&#189;d. per lb. I take it that the Government, as a protectionist Administration, are of opinion that a duty of 1&#189;d. per lb. will be sufficient to exclude candles of British origin, otherwise they would have imposed a higher duty. I think that the candles consumed in the Commonwealth should be made in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, in order to obtain better machinery. The question is whether the proposed duty as against England will enable the local candle company to increase its dividend. I am prepared to vote for the duty which the Government think sufficient to enable candles to be made here. Had the Government said that a duty of 2d. was necessary as against England, and 2-Jd. against the world, I should have voted, for the duty of 2d. all round, just as I am now. willing to vote for a duty of I4d. all round, seeing that the latter duty must be regarded by the Government as sufficient to prevent candles coming from England. I understand that the Government are prepared to adopt protection sufficient to prevent an importation of candles, not only from&#39; foreign nations, but from England. </para>

                            <para>- We are told that the local manufacturers now have 87 per cent, of the trade, and the other 13 per cent, could not increase their dividends very much unless the price is made higher. I understand from some figures quoted by the honorable member for Kooyong that if the Government proposal is adopted it will mean an extra cost to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company at &#163;3,800 a year. Personally, that consideration does not give me much concern, because I have no doubt that if the prices go up, the Broken Hill companies will commence to make their own candles, just as they are now making their own coke, the price of which was affected by the duty previously imposed. Only the other day I was talking to the manager of one of the big Broken- Hill companies; and made that suggestion to him. He admitted that the idea had not occurred to him before, but he made a note of it; and I am hopeful that if a duty is imposed. the result may be the manufacture of candles &#39;by the mining companies. </para>

                        Exactly; and it seems to me that if employment is given it does not matter whether it be bv big mining companies or by individual manufacturers.

                            <para>- So far as the individual consumers are concerned, the duty will probably result in an increased price. We must not forget, however, that the Government promise a Board or Commission to regulate prices to individuals as part of the&#34; new protection scheme - that consumers and workers, as well as manufacturers, are to be protected. </para>

                        <para>. - We have now been engaged two days in debating one item, and, though we have had quite a flood of information in regard to the candle industry, I regret that we should not have come to a division before, now. Our difficulty is to obtain information from those who have practical knowledge; but the honorable member for Fawkner is in that position, and has shown us .the results of a Tariff which was previously in operation. As a result of the Victorian Tariff, certain people with whom that honorable member has been closely associated embarked in the industry, and it has been successful, and has been the means of reducing the price of a commodity in common demand. The candle works to which the honorable member referred have been in existence since that time, and the industry is now pretty well distributed throughout Australia; indeed, I have had some pleasure, and, I hope, some profit, in handling these goods, which.  1  may say, were all that they were represented to be. As a result of the work of the Sydney Soap and Candle Company, and other companies, the consumption of candles in Australia is now almost met by the local supply, and it may be taken that the article produced gives satisfaction to the people generally, allowing, of course, for a certain proportion who, from taste or sentiment, prefer to have their goods from abroad. It is a fact that, before the time referred to by the honorable member for Fawkner, candles were much dearer in Australia than they are now; and it has been shown that the article manufactured here is not only equal, but, in many cases, superior to that imported. That being so, it appears to me that, though I am in sympathy with the policy of the Government, I might make a suggestion which would meet the circumstances in which we find ourselves. The duty of id. per lb. previously imposed has been successful in so &#39; far that the industry is now fairly well established ; and, that being so, I do not think we need go quite as far as the Government proposal, although the industry will be affected by the proposed duty on stearine and paraffine wax.. I intend, after the amendment of the honorable member for Lang has been disposed of, to move that the duties of 24d and 2d. be reduced to 2d. and 1&#189;d., leaving the other duties as they appear. If the honorable member for Lang could see his way to withdraw his proposal, the amendment I have indicated could be submitted now. </para>

                        <para>.- The Government have shown that there is no&#39; necessity for the increased duties proposed by them since five-sixths of the Australian trade is supplied by local manufacturers. If. we place the people in the hands of the importers, without competition., we shall have exactly the same results as we should obtain from the placing of the people in the hands of the manufacturers, and shutting out all outside competition. The imports of candles are a mere bagatelle, but they are sufficient to keep down prices to a reasonable level. The moment we increase the duty, as the Government propose, by 100 per cent, m the one case, and by 150 per cent, in the other, we shall give the local manufacturers a monopoly of the trade. The manufacturer is not one -whit more considerate than the importer. A reasonable competition between the local manufacturer and the importer is the only protection that the consumer can be given. One of the disadvantages of protection is that under it manufacturers have no difficulty in combining. Reference has been made to the wages question, and I propose to quote from the report of the Chief Inspector of . Factories in Victoria for 1907 some significant figures bearing on that phase of the question. Appendix C to that report gives, the average weekly wages paid in various trades, and, under that heading, we find that there are 152 hands employed in the candle-making industry in Victoria at an average wage of &#163;1 4s. 8d. per week. There are eleven receiving 6s. 8d. per &#39; week, nineteen receiving 9s. id. per week, ten at 12S. 10d., eighteen at 15s. 7d., eight at 16s. ixd., five at 20s. 7d., three at 23s., and seventy-eight at 35s- per week, or, as I have said, a total of 152 receiving an average weekly wage of 24s. 8d. . Evidence was given before the Commission that men were receiving &#163;2 2S- ar,d &#163;2 IOS- Per week. The Chief Inspector of - Victoria, who has no axe to grind, presents an impartial report, from which we learn that the highest wage paid is 35s. per week. Either that report is incorrect, or the employers swore falsely when before the Commission. _ I venture to assert that the report of the Chief Inspector will be found to be correct, and, if that be so, honorable members must recognise that it is necessary to enact that the employes in all industries shall secure a fair proportion of the advantages of the protective duties imposed. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Grey has produced evidence as to the wages paid in the candle-making industry in Victoria. All protectionists to-day claim to be new protectionists, and the object of a high duty is to enable high wages to be paid to the employes in the industries to which those duties relate. I admitted during the debate on the Address-in-Reply, that unless protection were given  to the worker - unless he secured in the shape of higher wages some of the advantages of protection - I should not vote for any duty. I repeat that statement. We are determined -under the new protection policy that better wages shall be paid. Unfortunately, we have to admit that in the past the placing of a duty upon a commodity has not insured the payment of good wages to those engaged locally in producing that commodity. I do not make one statement on the&#39; platform and another in this House. I admit that almost starvation wages have been paid by many of the manufacturers, and it is to insure higher rates of pay and better conditions of labour for the worker - whilst at the same time protecting the consumer- - that the policy of the new protection is to be put in force. By the imposition of higher duties we hope to improve the conditions of the worker whilst at the same time safeguarding the interests of the consumer. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Fawkner has admitted that under the old duty of id. per lb. local manufacturers secured five-sixths, of the Australian trade, so that only about 14 per cent.&#39; of the trade remains to <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> captured by them. If, as proposed by the Government, the duty be raised to 2 ki. per lb. they will have an absolute monopoly. The honorable member pleaded that although this large proportion of the trade has been secured by Australian manufacturers, they were paying meagre dividends, which did not represent a fair return on the capital invested. Is it likely that the profit, to be derived from the remaining 14 per cent, of the total trade would be sufficient to enable them to pay reasonable dividends? I think not. But if we pass these higher duties the manufacturers will be able to obtain an absolute monopoly, and so raise prices as to insure the payment of good dividends. That is a point of which I hope honorable members will not lose sight. The members of the Opposition are at one with the members of the Labour Party in desiring to see good rates of wages paid. None of us has ever done anything to show that he would like to see low wages paid. But we do not wish to bring into existence a monopoly, and I appeal to my honorable friends in the Labour corner to assist us in preventing the creation of a monopoly. If there is one thing to which they object more than to another, it is a monopoly. I had other remarks to make, but, as most of what I intended to say has been said by other speakers, I shall -not detain the Committee longer. </para>

With regard to what has been said about the Rangoon candles, I wish to inform honorable members that I have learnt from a reliable source that it is only the poorest kind of labour that can be hired in British India for 4d. a day, and that the coolies employed in making candles in Rangoon are paid a rate which approximates, in British money, is. a day, while a large amount of white labour is used, to which wages are paid twice as high as those ruling in Australia for the same kind of work. </para>

                            <para>- That is what I am doing. The Treasurer spoke of the poisonous character of the fumes given off by the Rangoon candles, but, .as a matter of fact, none but the purest material is used in their manufacture. Their constituents are &#39;mineral, not animal, and the exhalation is pure carbon, which is not nearly so poisonous as the acid fumes of stearine candles. Moreover, because of the great heat in India, wax of a low melting point cannot be made, and, therefore, only the best paraffine wax is used. The protectionist members of the Tariff Commission report that the Sydney Soap and Candle Company employs only no hands all told, including every one engaged in the industry. The company pays .&#163;8,500 a year in wages, an average of about 30s. a week per employe - a magnificent wage, truly. But only ,&#163;2,000 a year is actually paid in the making of candles, the balance being paid to employes in other branches of the company&#39;s business. From the same source I learn that, while Messrs. Kitchen and Sons have something like &#163;100,000 invested in their business, the total value of the plant used in candle-making does not exceed &#163;1,000, and of the hands &#34; employed, only 15 per cent, are engaged in making candles. Therefore, the candle-making industry is a very small one. </para>

                        <para>.- On hearing honorable members call &#34; divide &#34; so impatiently, a stranger might imagine that they were all Socialists, and wish me to divide my substance with them. As a matter of fact, if I did they would not get very much. I should not have spoken&#39; but for the remarks of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. I like his breezy manner, but he made some strong admissions. He stated that in the past, under protection, starvation wages have been paid in many industries. That is one reason why I, and other members of the Opposition, have always opposed protection. We contended that, under that policy, the public were unduly taxed, while the employes received only starvation wages. But, the honorable member continued, there was now the new protection. New protection is a very new idea to the Treasurer. Although, for years, he has been supporting protection, &#39;under which it is admitted starvation wages have been paid to the employes, he has heard of the new protection only since it was invented for him by the Labour Party. </para>

                            <para>- I am for the new protection ; but the manufacturers will not like it. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports told us that he favours the increase of the duties because of the new protection.  His  remarks reminded me of the patter of the cheap-jack, who tells his audience, &#34; My patent, cure-all at  2s.  6d. a bottle is very good, but, mind you, it is necessary to have the pills as well, at 2s. 6d. a box.&#34; The honorable member says, &#34; I will go in for high duties, but, mind you, this is not to benefit the manufacturer, but to benefit the employes.&#34; He has, however, admitted that in the past the employes in protected industries have been starved. Why should we increase the taxation of the people to increase starvation? I shall vote on every division to make the duties on this item as low as possible. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to put two facts before the Committee before we divide. We have heard a good deal about (the competition of Rangoon candles, and the lowering of prices by duties. In 1894 a Board was  appointed in Victoria to inquire into the effect upon industry and production of the fiscal system of this State. Several well known manufacturers gave evidence before that body, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Ambrose Kitchen, who stated that he represented the Apollo Candle Company of Port Melbourne. That gentleman affirmed that 90 or 95 per cent, of the candles consumed in Victoria were of colonial make. That was the substance of his evidence. In other words, notwithstanding the competition of the Rangoon candles and candles of British manufacture, Victoria was pretty well able to hold her own in the manufacture of these articles. </para>
